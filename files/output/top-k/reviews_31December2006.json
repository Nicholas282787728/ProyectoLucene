It has a gritty sense of style and realism to it that is greatly enhanced by its low budget. I believe the entire film cost something like 30,000 to make. The direction is first-rate by one of the sometime forgotten masters of direction, certainly a giant of the B picture world, Edgar G. Ulmer. Ulmer paces the film well and creates taut suspense. The film runs only 67 minutes which is all the more a credit to the director and screenwriter Martin Goldsmith. The principal acting leads are more than credible and very memorable. Tom Neal plays a man hitchhiking his way to the woman he loves from New York to California only to be picked up by a man that dies while Neal is driving. From there on - more than halfway through the film - things fall apart quickly for Neal when he picks up a female hitchhiker that had been alluded to earlier. Neal opens his saga in a coffee joint at the beginning of the film and narrates throughout much like any other film noir classic(Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, etc...). Ann Savage plays one of the screen's truly most annoying, hideous women as Vera the hitchhiker. Ulmer brings a quick resolution to the film but the climatic moment at film's end is not to be missed. While gritty, the film does look pretty cheap at some scenes, there are not very many actors(good or bad - you be the judge?), and the ending - though inventive is abrupt. Detour, nonetheless, is a milestone in film for its contributions to film noir and as a reminder of how good Ulmer really was, but it, even more importantly, shows us today in our world of big budget films what a group of talented people can do with so very little.

Is this Europe's cinema Veriee? Or perhaps neo cinema Veriee? Makes no difference what they call it, but it doesn't come off as particularly realistic. Perhaps it's neo Euro-trash porn. They tried to put porn into mainstream movies in the early 70s and it failed. And so it will fail this time, too, in spite of such talentless - and hence highly regarded - Eurotrash directors such as von Trier who propagate such junk. I hardly think that showing a man's erection adds to the realism of a movie. What about the dialogue? On quite a few occasions the characters talk and interact in an unrealistic way; real people simply don't behave the way these characters do half of the time. Yet, there is a belief that just because Kerry Fox is actually shown putting her co-star's erection in her mouth that this will somehow add new dimensions to the realism of a movie, realism never seen before. I think not.On the other hand, I always had the wish to see the seemingly impossible a (semi-)famous actress in a pornographic scene. I can't say I wasn't pleased when Kerry Fox in one scene grabs her co-stars penis, and then even orally pleasures it (briefly, unfortunately) in another scene. And it's rather nice that it was Kerry Fox who has had the dubious privilege of becoming one of extremely few known actresses to become a temporary porn star. Of course, I'd love to see Shirley MacLaine get it from behind, Elizabeth Taylor engage in masturbation, Susan Sarandon do it doggy-style, etc, but Fox is a pretty good choice, too. Though, I must say, Fox looks more than a little embarrassed in the porn scenes. Considering she got some award in some meaningless little European festival, this is surprising. I mean, didn't the jury who awarded her notice her obvious lack of relaxedness during the sex scenes? Lousy Eurotrash jury...The movie isn't too boring. The hand-held camera shtick is quite tiresome at times - another hint that this director belongs to the Lars von Trier trash director's club of European losers. (Losers 95.) The film would have been a shade weaker if it weren't for Fox's charisma. The male lead was ideally cast in Institute Benjamenta, but rather badly cast this time around. Being a continental European, his accent takes too long to get used to and it's rather silly the way he tries to do a British\/London\/whatever-accent-he's-supposed-to-be-doing and his swearing (which is regular) comes off as totally unconvincing. There is also a character who plays a gay man - which seems to be a must in today's movies and sit-coms every film and series has to have a homosexual, and it's almost always a happy-go-lucky smart-ass full of wise advice for the lead characters, who are of course straight. (And every courtroom scene nowadays has to have a black female judge, as if that will contribute to solving the problem of racism, but that's another story.) All in all, much better than anything von Trier has\/will ever come up with, but ultimately pointless.How dumb does Kerry Fox have to be to be suckered into doing a porn film?

I have been watching it since 1998 and it has never gotten old. I loved how the plot of the movie blended so well with the actual events, and the attention to detail was out of this world. The accuracy with the ship's details such as the opulence of the interior First Class areas, the riveting detail on the ship's exterior, the wardrobes of the actors and actresses, it all seemed so real, like time went back to 1912 and stood still, like it was all back again. And the love story between Jack and Rose, oh it was so nice. I love how they had an older Rose telling the story, and when it switched from her now to how she was then. It was awesome! One of my favorite scenes though, is definitely the King of the World scene because I think that James Cameron really captured the feeling of the time of the Titanic's. She was the largest ship afloat, the finest afloat, and it was during a time when people thought they had nowhere to go but up. Things were changing and getting better all the time with new technologies, and the Titanic was like an icon for that. So the King of the World part is just awesome. Imagine a Third Class passenger winning a ticket like that. You could only imagine that they'd had to have felt that way. And then when the camera comes back and you see the Titanic, proud on the waves in all her glory, it's truly awesome. And then when they zoom in on Captain Smith, beaming proudly, what an awesome way to portray him. You have to wonder if he really felt that way then. How proud he must've felt. The only thing that I didn't like about it was how they portrayed First Officer Murdoch. There were some witnesses who said they heard shots or saw shots being fired, reports of an officer shooting himself that night, but it was never proved. And given the real Officer Murdoch's character, I don't think he did anything like that. Nor do I think any of the officers shot themselves or someone else. They made him out to be a villain that I don't believe he was. Other than the fact that I thought Rose said Jack one too many times, the movie was near perfect. Totally awesome.

In 1943, Casablanca dealt with the seedy underbelly of the black market, and how it was used to transport people persecuted by Nazi Germany to the United States.

On his way, he meets a sailor named Homer Parrish (Harold Russell) and an infantry sergeant named Al Stephenson (Fredric March). Each man has a different perspective of their home town, as well as unique experiences from the war, even though all three served in the Pacific Theatre. And all three men bear their own scars of the war.Though, like most films from Hollywood's so-called golden age, this movie does have a Hollywood ending, it isn't contrived here.

Christina Ricci and Cate Blanchett are both stunningly beautiful and breathtakingly gifted. But if you check your IMDb stats, you'll notice that Cate Blanchett is more than ten years older than Christina, and a good six inches taller.What does this mean? Well, it means that when you see them together, Cate is obviously the one you'd pick as the big sister, the wise and protective mother figure. She towers over Christina like C3P0 standing next to R2D2. But in the story, Cate's character Lola is supposed to be a silly, empty-headed floozy while Christina's character Suzie is an intense, passionate, deeply determined young heroine. Neither actress is right in terms of age or appearance. Cate is too tall, too noble, too elegant and aristocratic a physical presence to be cast as a trashy, comically inept gold digger. And Christina Ricci is too tiny, too fresh-faced, and too physically undeveloped to be Cate's equal.At the same time, film maker Sally Potter seems absolutely indifferent to the realism of the story, and the storytelling problems of pace, suspense, tension and credibility. While little Suzie drifts dreamily into an almost mystical affair with a hunky Gypsy, (Johnny Depp) the needy and greedy Lola clumsily ropes in a rich but comically cruel and stupid opera star. (John Turturro, the only major character who's perfectly cast in type and ability.) Problem is, Suzie's dreamy affair doesn't really seem that heroic. She doesn't help her Gypsy friends escape the Nazis. She doesn't even help the nice Jewish lady who lives downstairs. All she does is moon around looking serious and dreamy. She hates the anti-Semitism of the cowardly opera singer, but she doesn't really do anything to counter it. She doesn't even warn Lola not to marry the guy, or tell her she could find lots of better men.The whole story would have worked much, much better if Cate Blanchett and Christina Ricci had been cast better according to size, age, looks and type. Cate should have been the rich, self-assured, and aristocratic wife of a Vichy French banker or politician. She hears Chrstina sing and is captivated by her waif-like looks and pure, child like voice. The two become friends, almost like sisters, but then Cate, who's good at heart but rather bored with her much older husband, starts up an affair with that stunning Gypsy lad. For her he's just a fun fling, but young Christina falls for him on a deeper level, wanting to help him save his people from the Nazis. When spoiled Cate finds out her little sister has stolen her man, she flies into a horrible jealous rage and tells the Nazis everything -- but at the last minute she comes to the rescue and dies nobly, allowing Christina and her Gypsy to escape to America on the last boat out of Marseilles.Now THAT'S a movie!

","genre":"Drama, Music, Romance"},{"date":"31 December 2006","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Dreamy camera work, and a spirited performance by a luscious cast, aren't quite enough to save this confused and almost incoherent wartime melodrama about a romantic Jewish showgirl finding love and danger in Nazi occupied Paris.Here is a fascinating example of how casting people can overlook the most basic physical facts about the actors. Christina Ricci and Cate Blanchett are both stunningly beautiful and breathtakingly gifted. But if you check your IMDb stats, you'll notice that Cate Blanchett is more than ten years older than Christina, and a good six inches taller.What does this mean? Well, it means that when you see them together, Cate is obviously the one you'd pick as the big sister, the wise and protective mother figure. She towers over Christina like C3P0 standing next to R2D2. But in the story, Cate's character Lola is supposed to be a silly, empty-headed floozy while Christina's character Suzie is an intense, passionate, deeply determined young heroine. Neither actress is right in terms of age or appearance. Cate is too tall, too noble, too elegant and aristocratic a physical presence to be cast as a trashy, comically inept gold digger. And Christina Ricci is too tiny, too fresh-faced, and too physically undeveloped to be Cate's equal.At the same time, film maker Sally Potter seems absolutely indifferent to the realism of the story, and the storytelling problems of pace, suspense, tension and credibility. While little Suzie drifts dreamily into an almost mystical affair with a hunky Gypsy, (Johnny Depp) the needy and greedy Lola clumsily ropes in a rich but comically cruel and stupid opera star. (John Turturro, the only major character who's perfectly cast in type and ability.) Problem is, Suzie's dreamy affair doesn't really seem that heroic. She doesn't help her Gypsy friends escape the Nazis. She doesn't even help the nice Jewish lady who lives downstairs. All she does is moon around looking serious and dreamy. She hates the anti-Semitism of the cowardly opera singer, but she doesn't really do anything to counter it. She doesn't even warn Lola not to marry the guy, or tell her she could find lots of better men.The whole story would have worked much, much better if Cate Blanchett and Christina Ricci had been cast better according to size, age, looks and type. Cate should have been the rich, self-assured, and aristocratic wife of a Vichy French banker or politician. She hears Chrstina sing and is captivated by her waif-like looks and pure, child like voice. The two become friends, almost like sisters, but then Cate, who's good at heart but rather bored with her much older husband, starts up an affair with that stunning Gypsy lad.

When spoiled Cate finds out her little sister has stolen her man, she flies into a horrible jealous rage and tells the Nazis everything -- but at the last minute she comes to the rescue and dies nobly, allowing Christina and her Gypsy to escape to America on the last boat out of Marseilles.Now THAT'S a movie!

This movie is almost set entirely in the Wild West of the late 19th century.The movie features all of the Western clichés but at the same time it doesn't ridicule the genre. Pistol fights at dawn, hanging, robbing the stagecoach, typical villains, a sheriff, you name it and its in this movie. You may say that Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale pay a great homage to the longtime gone genre of classic spaghetti Westerns, with using all of the typical clichés and small references.Back to the Future and Back to the Future Part II were two brilliantly written movies, with ingenious connected plot lines, moments and characters. Back to the Future Part III is also well written and is definitely fun and entertaining but just not as clever or ingenious as the previous two movies. Back to the Future Part III surely does still offer plenty of enough entertainment and cleverness. It makes sure that the movie overall is an entertaining one, that is also definitely helped by its characters and good, quick, fun directing from Robert Zemeckis, who with the Back to the Future movies made himself immortal as a movie director.Besides the Wild West concept the movie also differs from the other previous two Back to the Future movies in many more ways. Of course the Wild West already provides the movie with a totally different atmosphere and premise than the previous two Back to the Future movies but also the storytelling and approach makes this movie a 'different' one. You can really say that perhaps this time the real main character of the movie is the Doc. The main plot line (a love story) of the movie involves him. Not much room for Marty and his family this time in this one, unlike had been the case in the previous two movies. I liked the previous two movies so much because Marty clashed in his past and future with his own relatives, that were alive at that time period. It always resulted in some comical- and brilliant written and constructed moments. Back to the Future Part III doesn't really have enough moments of that. It still has some fun moments involving time traveling and of course mainly the cultural differences that show what happens if characters from this time period are being set back in the early 19th century. It makes some of the moments in the movie still hilarious, such as Marty's clothes, his choice to name himself Clint Eastwood, Frisbees and the opening ceremony of the well known clock from the Back to the Future movies.The movie of course also future 'distant' relatives of characters that are alive in 1985, the real-time, time period of the entire trilogy. Some play a more prominent role than others. Again the main villain is a Tannen. Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen, to be exact. A typical stereotype example of a dumb but ruthless Western villain. He is perfectly portrayed by Thomas F. Wilson. The entire cast is basically great. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd have really grown into their roles and the chemistry is still there. They are being helped this time by the great Mary Steenburgen, as Doc's love interest.What I love about the Back to the Future movies is that they always pick things up were the last movie ended. It makes the movie really a trilogy that can also be perfectly watched as one movie, just as the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars movies.The movie is really great looking with great sets, costumes and make-up effects that suit the time period of the movie just right. What the movie also does well is blending in the different atmospheres of the different time periods with each others. When the movie is set back in 1985, you don't have the feeling like you're watching a totally different movie. Dean Cundey's cinematography of the movie is great and he also plays a small cameo role in the movie itself by the way. Alan Silvestri's musical score is also great but again also the lesser of the three in my opinion. But it's still great, so what am I really complaining about...The early special effects are also quite good, considering its period this movie was made.The movie is really great, fun, clean, adventurous entertainment to watch from start till finish, with fun characters, settings and directing.

It was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly on the Bog of Allen and, father westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves. It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns. His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead. I think that few endings are as fine, as transcendent as that penned by Joyce in 1914. It rivals the final paragraphs of Sir Thomas Browne's Hydriotaphia (A Discourse on Urn Burial) for pure sublimity. Tony Huston chose to quote it in full at the end of this remarkable adaptation of the novella contained within Joyce's brilliant, dissection of Irish society. The Dead is easily one of the best films made in the last two or so decades of the twentieth century; it is a pearl amidst swine.The entire cast work with (and therefore in certain senses, against) each other in an impeccable manner. The direction is consistent and steady. The cinematography is respectful. The art direction is restrained and the period detail sure. The story is allowed to speak for itself and to carry itself at its own measured pace. Although it is little more than 80 minutes, we feel as though we have lived through every part of an Epiphany party than might have lasted for several hours or so. In most readings of Joyce I have been conscious of the time contained within a story passing at a natural rate (the effect is achieved with an horologists' care in Ulysses for example). The film is therefore a tribute to Joyce, much as it is for the ailing John Huston, one of Erin's own adopted sons.I gather than a sixty minute programme was made on the making of The Dead, and it was shown as part of the John Huston season that has just ended at London's National Film Theatre. Alas, I was unable to attend, but I have read that Huston was very ill at the time it was made, dependent on oxygen cylinders, and often unable to leave his car. He was therefore reliant upon his assistant directors and upon his son (Tony) and daughter (Angelica, as Gretta Conroy, one of her finest roles). This may have been a cathartic experience as I gather that relations between the very demanding father and daughter had been distant for some time - the experience of making this film led to a final reconciliation. Perhaps it was wrong for Huston, with his lungs wrecked, to leave the clear, dry air of Mexico for the dank, foetid vapours of London and Dublin (although I'm not sure that he actually did any of the exterior scenes in Ireland). Whatever the medical merits, the artistic result clearly vindicated his decision.Many of the stories in Dubliners are concerned with the sterility and stolidity of Irish society 'The Sisters' (the reference to Fr. Flynn's 'paralysis' is apt), 'A Painful Case', 'A Mother', etc. Gabriel Conroy (a superlative Donal McCann) surveys the prospect of the party arranged by two elderly maiden aunts, and surmises that most of those assembled are, one way or the other, half-dead. Then, stung by his wife's lament for the passing of her original (only?) love, he understands he himself, with his own want of feeling, of passion, of emotional engagement, is afflicted by that same malaise. Is Ireland dead or is it merely sleeping? Will it - as Molly Ivors (an electric Maria McDermottroe) sincerely hopes - awake when the British yoke is cast off, and it ceases to be 'John Bull's other island'? Gabriel is sceptical - like Joyce himself, he would rather travel to France than Galway (where Michael Furey lies buried by the shores of Loch Corrib at Oughterard). Molly enjoins Gabriel, a London hack, to learn Gaelic. Gabriel almost hunches his shoulders - the people of the Pale have given the same shrug to the outer reaches of Connacht and Munster for centuries (only now that residential property prices in Kerry and Clare have scaled the heights of those in Surrey and Berkshire are attitudes starting to adjust). Joyce shrugs too - but the suggestion that Ireland is only blanketed in snow, and not deadened by permafrost, suggests that he still has hope for his nation.There are no false notes in this film, no mis-steps. Even Tony Huston's interpolation of Lady Gregory's ode to love is woven seamlessly into the script, and enhanced it brilliantly (thanks to the excellent recital by Sean McClory as Mr Grace). The entire cast delivered an outstanding performance, and I should make particular mention of Cathleen Delany as Aunt Julia, Marie Kean as Mrs Malins and Donal Donnelly as her wayward son, Freddy, and lastly Frank Patterson as the bibulous Bartell D'Arcy (a particularly interesting character - at once very Anglican and yet very Irish, and therefore a typical Dublin type, the city being in certain respects an island of unionism and protestantism in a Romish and increasingly republican sea). I mention these actors not because they are superior to the others, but because they illuminate particular aspects of this besetting malaise that interest me. Of these, the most significant is Aunt Julia. It is she whom Gabriel sees in her coffin, and there is something in her indomitable rendition of 'Arrayed for the Bridal' the beautiful, resolute, yet curiously myopic eyes set in a failing face, that typify the confused mixture hope and desolation that 'The Dead' represents. A stellar performance and a fitting epitaph to one of the last and greatest of old Hollywood.

Even Tony Huston's interpolation of Lady Gregory's ode to love is woven seamlessly into the script, and enhanced it brilliantly (thanks to the excellent recital by Sean McClory as Mr Grace). The entire cast delivered an outstanding performance, and I should make particular mention of Cathleen Delany as Aunt Julia, Marie Kean as Mrs Malins and Donal Donnelly as her wayward son, Freddy, and lastly Frank Patterson as the bibulous Bartell D'Arcy (a particularly interesting character - at once very Anglican and yet very Irish, and therefore a typical Dublin type, the city being in certain respects an island of unionism and protestantism in a Romish and increasingly republican sea). I mention these actors not because they are superior to the others, but because they illuminate particular aspects of this besetting malaise that interest me. Of these, the most significant is Aunt Julia. It is she whom Gabriel sees in her coffin, and there is something in her indomitable rendition of 'Arrayed for the Bridal' the beautiful, resolute, yet curiously myopic eyes set in a failing face, that typify the confused mixture hope and desolation that 'The Dead' represents.

It was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly on the Bog of Allen and, father westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves. It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns. His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead. I think that few endings are as fine, as transcendent as that penned by Joyce in 1914. It rivals the final paragraphs of Sir Thomas Browne's Hydriotaphia (A Discourse on Urn Burial) for pure sublimity. Tony Huston chose to quote it in full at the end of this remarkable adaptation of the novella contained within Joyce's brilliant, dissection of Irish society. The Dead is easily one of the best films made in the last two or so decades of the twentieth century; it is a pearl amidst swine.The entire cast work with (and therefore in certain senses, against) each other in an impeccable manner. The direction is consistent and steady. The cinematography is respectful. The art direction is restrained and the period detail sure. The story is allowed to speak for itself and to carry itself at its own measured pace. Although it is little more than 80 minutes, we feel as though we have lived through every part of an Epiphany party than might have lasted for several hours or so. In most readings of Joyce I have been conscious of the time contained within a story passing at a natural rate (the effect is achieved with an horologists' care in Ulysses for example). The film is therefore a tribute to Joyce, much as it is for the ailing John Huston, one of Erin's own adopted sons.I gather than a sixty minute programme was made on the making of The Dead, and it was shown as part of the John Huston season that has just ended at London's National Film Theatre. Alas, I was unable to attend, but I have read that Huston was very ill at the time it was made, dependent on oxygen cylinders, and often unable to leave his car. He was therefore reliant upon his assistant directors and upon his son (Tony) and daughter (Angelica, as Gretta Conroy, one of her finest roles). This may have been a cathartic experience as I gather that relations between the very demanding father and daughter had been distant for some time - the experience of making this film led to a final reconciliation. Perhaps it was wrong for Huston, with his lungs wrecked, to leave the clear, dry air of Mexico for the dank, foetid vapours of London and Dublin (although I'm not sure that he actually did any of the exterior scenes in Ireland). Whatever the medical merits, the artistic result clearly vindicated his decision.Many of the stories in Dubliners are concerned with the sterility and stolidity of Irish society 'The Sisters' (the reference to Fr. Flynn's 'paralysis' is apt), 'A Painful Case', 'A Mother', etc. Gabriel Conroy (a superlative Donal McCann) surveys the prospect of the party arranged by two elderly maiden aunts, and surmises that most of those assembled are, one way or the other, half-dead. Then, stung by his wife's lament for the passing of her original (only?) love, he understands he himself, with his own want of feeling, of passion, of emotional engagement, is afflicted by that same malaise. Is Ireland dead or is it merely sleeping? Will it - as Molly Ivors (an electric Maria McDermottroe) sincerely hopes - awake when the British yoke is cast off, and it ceases to be 'John Bull's other island'? Gabriel is sceptical - like Joyce himself, he would rather travel to France than Galway (where Michael Furey lies buried by the shores of Loch Corrib at Oughterard). Molly enjoins Gabriel, a London hack, to learn Gaelic. Gabriel almost hunches his shoulders - the people of the Pale have given the same shrug to the outer reaches of Connacht and Munster for centuries (only now that residential property prices in Kerry and Clare have scaled the heights of those in Surrey and Berkshire are attitudes starting to adjust). Joyce shrugs too - but the suggestion that Ireland is only blanketed in snow, and not deadened by permafrost, suggests that he still has hope for his nation.There are no false notes in this film, no mis-steps.

The opening scene of a murder and search for the films main character Robert DeNiro as Noodles is reminiscent of Sergio Leone's openers for his man with no name westerns, but the thing that even sinks this interesting beginning is an annoying telephone ringing, that rings for about 3 scenes at least for 3 or 4 minutes before anyone answers it and the piercing noise of this phone only makes you irritated, I really couldn't wait for someone to answer it.So right off the bat I am agitated with the movie, to paraphrase the rest of the film's first 3 hours and more annoyances and perverseness. I ask these questions - Do we need to show a young girls (Deborah) naked breast and behind, played by 14 year old Jennifer Connelly?- Do we need to see a teen boy sitting on a toilet, or groping a buxom teenager in the same bathroom?- Or losing his virginity to the same girl on the roof of a building. - Or statutory rape of the child by a police office at least 40 years her senior.- Then we have an uninteresting character named Moe whose face was beaten to a pulp in the opening sequence, fully recovered and owning some bar in 1968, played by one of the worlds most boring actors (Larry Rapp) in a cast of boring actors. Question Why couldn't it have been the Moe the bartender character from the Simpson's instead? - We have to put up with a rape scene of Deborah now full grown and portrayed by Elizabeth McGovern, by her childhood sweetheart Noodles (Robert DeNiro) who is supposed to be the Good guy. Why does this scene need to go on and on?The rape scene takes a good 2 or 3 minutes to transpire and when he is done, he rips off her top and rapes her again without any regret. The scene is so vile and repulsive it makes the Jodie Foster rape scene in THE ACCUSED look like a gentle kiss on the cheek by two friends.Has Leone ever heard of the expression less is more? We can learn a lot with only a few seconds devoted to a subject rather than the entire act being played out in all its disgust.Now the pacing, the pacing is so slow and tedious without any real sense of awe or marvel. Why take so long to uncover something as mundane as a crypt where we already know that the 3 buddies of Noodles are kept? I was half expecting James Woods to be sitting atop his casket saying thought I was dead didn't ya? with all the time it took Deniro to walk in the darn door, the door that he seemed to open then close then open again then look at the names on the graves then close the door then get the key. Why does this scene take so long? What was the point?I found myself asking this question about almost every scene. Throughout the film.The pacing is just so slow and non revelatory in any real eye opening sense that it just leaves you frustrated.This movie is neither a classic nor even a good gangster movie, all the good things he did that made ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST so great he doesn't do here, and one of the major things he failed to do when casting great actors like DeNiro and Woods (all the other actors are awful) is give them interesting characters to play or interesting things to say. Heck even a narrator could have helped me out here.And Burt Young? Why Burt Young? Does anyone even know how this guy achieved an acting career? I had to rewind a few times just to understand what he was saying when he was telling that joke in the restaurant.In a scene where the 4 Jewish gangsters rob the diamond merchants; All I could think to myself was that Guy Richie did this scene so much better (obviously Richie was influenced by this scene) in the movie SNATCH.Then during the heist Noodles rapes Weld's character who is I guess a masochist? This is basically done to set up how he treats women he actually cares for, like Deborah who he rapes in the limo as listed earlier. Oh that's correct the man was in prison, I forgot.And what the hell was that about the 4 friends whipping out there dicks for the Tuesday Weld character to measure with her eyes? I thought a porno was gonna start happening. I could hear the Dun-chicka-dun-dun music in my head somewhere.....This movie was dull, non revelatory, brutally shocking in many places for no good verifiable reason and humorless, even when the 38 different writers that are listed in the credits tried to be funny. OK there are not really 38 writers more like 6.All in all this movie was a waste of 4 hours and should have been edited down to 2 and even then nothing could save it from being boring, filled with wooden performances by B movie actors, a bad score, anonymous background noises, phones ringing seemingly forever, pointless rape sequences, women treated with the utmost of disrespect and did I say Burt Young? Well Treat Williams and Larry Rapp are in this too and THEY SUCK as well!!!Give me Millers Crossing, Road to Perdition, Goodfellas, A Bronx Tale, The Sopranos, The Godfather and Mean Streets any day!! Heck I would even watch Christian Slater and Richard Grieco in Mobsters again, that Once upon a time in America!!Classic?? As in classic over pretentious, unsubtle garbage!!!

Shot in brilliant film noir black and white, and set on location in the ruined post-war city of Vienna, the film explores and unfolds mediated relations and on several levels. Most obviously are the interpersonal relations between the film's main characters a woman's (Alida Valli, played by Anna Schmidt) two incomplete paramours, specifically one actual but absent Harry Lime (Orson Welles), the other a present but only potential lover, Rollo Martins (Joseph Cotten). But the film also explores the indirect and shady economic relations of the black market, and the equally gray morality that seems a necessary means of coping with relations steered from the straight and narrow. Any one of these three themes could make a movie. But the Third Man's brilliance is in its success at playing out its themes using each mode of cinematic expression (story, image, sound). Much of the film is shot with dutch angles (an angled camera, which puts the frame askew). Rollo Martins, a straight up American visiting old friend Harry LIme (whom we don't find till the end of the film), is framed straight up and down. But as he begins to encounter an underground economy (and the film's conclusion is indeed shot in the city's drainage system) of barter, favors, bribes and corruption, the frame tilts. Scenes shot in alley ways also tell of perilous and shadowy pastimes and night times. Scenes featuring our heroine frame her, literally, in windows and doors (though she's not the only one who's framed). The moral choices our hero faces can only bend if he is to find his friend or get the girl (it's not clear which it will be, but by convention he oughtn't get either until he makes the right choice, that is to say, morally right--the right kind of choice according to the film). While Valli refuses to compromise her principles, even at the risk of deportation to the Russian sector (she's Czech), Martins makes trades to keep her in Vienna. And Martins, rather than allow Valli contact with Lime (her lover presumed dead), keeps them apart in order to save her for himself. What Martins tells her, and Lime, is never clearly, nor completely true. The world of film noir is a world in which choices are hazy and relations, being alliances, are subject to change. But our lead actors survive temptations to uphold the genre conventions. It's not till the 50's that heroes, sheriffs, cops, and detectives become morally ambiguous (or ambivalent Eastwood was not a Wayne). The shift takes interesting shape in gangster films with themes of betrayal. Gangster films began as cops-and-robbers films, in which the contrast of moral choices was portrayed in the high contrast of black and white. But the gang, and a mafia in particular, is a family. The crime of family betrayal (whether to the cops, or to another gang) replaces the black and white of moral distinctions to become the source of tension in films like the Godfather, Casino, and Donnie Brasco. The Third Man's theme of triangulation is where the psychology of indirect relations really comes into the limelight. Philosopher Gilles Deleuze observes that the logic of Alfred Hitchcock's suspense is not the whodunit of a crime, but its for whom was it done. He reveals plot points to the camera (and thus the audience) that are concealed from the film's characters. In fact the audience sometimes knows who has committed the crime from the very beginning; what's not known is the characters' relations to the crime, or its perpetrators, and this unsettles their relations to one another. Their relations are then developed according to the film's logical puzzle (as opposed to their emotional or real relations to one another). In the Third Man the position of third is not fixed but circulates. All relations are not equal, and in the Third Man, Martins, Lime, and Valli must choose their relationships to one another on the basis of muddled events, a shadowy underworld's downward gravitational pull, obfuscating facts and the incomplete observations of witnesses--honest and dishonest alike. Direct relations have difficulty flourishing in a world of indirect and convenient allegiances. But the romantic story-line requires the directness of communication (affection expects honesty and sincerity). If Martins' courtship of Valli is to succeed, he must leave his triangulations and draw a straight and direct line to her. As the film nears its incredible showdown--a standout moment in film-making on its own--the audience knows Martins is facing an almost impossible choice as a friend (to LIme) and lover (not yet but hoping to become for Valli). He must reveal the truth about Lime to the police if he wants Valli to see him. But he must take his action without the supporting angles of a triangle (angled shots of a dutch camera = the geometry of triangles?). It's a decision he can only take alone. And this is how it plays out. He takes the gun in his own hands and without the cover of the police in the waterways with him, confronts Lime for his immorality. He pulls the trigger, his act resounding with an echo against concrete tunnel walls, and in the back lit white of a dark passage way, Martins, now looking much a Western hero, walks his straight line back to the world above. We do not know if he gets the girl. The film begins with Martins noticing Valli, who is walking a straight line directly down the center of a straight road. He meets her again on the same road, after the same burial (this time it is Lime's body in the ground, put to rest where he belongs), and she doesn't look his way. The audience, however, knows that he is now on the same path, and that his choices have made him a candidate, at least, for a position in a romantic partnership.
