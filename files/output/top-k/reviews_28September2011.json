Sure, there were films before that handled large casts before, but never before had a film so successfully told an overlying story using so many characters, and have their lives so delicately intertwined. These characters have full histories and complex natures, yet they are only glimpsed and suggested in short scenes that say more in two or three minutes than most films can manage in a feature length running time.The film takes place over the course of five days in Nashville, Tennessee, and focuses around the minor and major players in the music business, and the hangers on that seem to always be around. The key characters are Haven Hamilton (Henry Gibson), a spangly-suited veteran singer with political ambitions, Barbara Jean (Ronee Blakley), a mentally unstable country music darling returning to her home town, Tom Frank (Keith Carradine), a member of a folk group trio who is trying to make it on his own and having as many woman as he can along the way, Linnea Reese (Lily Tomlin), a white gospel singer who is being pursued by Tom, and Del Reese (Ned Beatty), Linnea's manager husband, who seems to be oblivious to the strain on his marriage. All their lives are interconnected and are usually linked by an incident or a set-piece.The first scene of the film sees the campaign van for Presidential candidate Hal Phillip Walker setting off for a tour around Nashville, and appears throughout the film. The film even climaxes at a political rally for Walker, with Hamilton and Barbara Jean both appearing on stage, and the scene brings together nearly all of the films' characters. Although I didn't get from the film that it is necessarily making any kind of political statement, it was made soon after the Watergate scandal, and was released to an America that was looking for answers. I think Nashville is making both a warm and cynical statement about the optimism and the arrogance of America, and also the confusion and the uncertainty that came with the 1970's.Such is the beauty of Nashville. I couldn't sum up what it was about in one sentence, and couldn't describe a clear aim or message it was trying to deliver. It is a number of things, and touches a number of emotions. The real greatness is in its small moments, such as talentless and desperate aspiring country singer Sueleen Gay (Gwen Welles) singing to a room full of men, and then being told that she was brought there to strip; the cold detachment that Tom deals with Linnea when she reveals she can't stay any longer; the various characters who all think that Tom is singing to them in a crowded bar, as he gazes over them all to the back of the room; or the uncomfortable scene in which Barbara Jean keeps talking to an uneasy crowd rather than singing a song, as it becomes clear that she is truly losing her mind.Nashville is one of the key films of the 1970's, and one of the finest examples of the American New Wave that emerged in that time, and produced some of the finest films to ever come out of the country. Although Altman had been around for a while at that time (he had already done the brilliant MASH and the thoroughly underrated revisionist western classic McCabe & Mrs. Miller), this is the film where he truly found his forte. It's been imitated endlessly, but never has a film managed to do so much with so many different stories.

For example, it happened for Jean Arthur in 1935's The Whole Town's Talking, for Ava Gardner in 1946's The Killers, for Susan Hayward in 1947's Smash-up The Story of a Woman, for Marilyn Monroe in 1953's Niagara, for Brigitte Bardot in 1956's ...And God Created Woman. And for modern-day actress Laura Linney, it happened in writer\/director Kenneth Lonergan's 2000 film You Can Count On Me. In the role that put Linney on the radar of the greater public, the actress plays a young single mother of an 8-year-old boy. Samantha Sammy Prescott, when we first meet her, is going through a rough patch in her small (fictitious) town of Scottsville, in upstate New York. Her new boss at the bank (Matthew Broderick) has turned out to be an officious, micromanaging prig; she soon enters into a fairly torrid affair with this unhappily married man (a man with a baby on the way, to boot!) even though an old boyfriend has just proposed to her! And perhaps most distracting and distressing of all, her shiftless, wandering, ne'er-do-well younger brother, Terry (finely played by Mark Ruffalo), has just moved into her house for an extended visit. The unfolding relationships between brother and sister, Terry and his nephew Rudy (Rory Culkin; yes, Macaulay's younger brother), and employee and employer make up the bulk of this sweet, sad picture.Warm and touching, sentimental yet startlingly realistic, the film boasts any number of wonderful scenes. Among my favorites the restaurant reunion between Sammy and Terry, after a hiatus of two years; Terry takes his young nephew to a local dive bar to teach him to play pool; Sammy has her pastor (played by Lonergan himself) do an intervention for Terry; and, perhaps best of all, Sammy bids a tearful farewell to her brother at a bus stop. Lonergan's script is wise and astute, and his characters are all recognizable. You've met these people before; they are very much the stuff of real life; flawed people, one and all, trying to do good and scrape some happiness out of life. Lonergan's script rings painfully true, and his (first-time) direction is sensitive. The picture, filmed in summertime Margaretville and Phoenicia, NY, in the Catskills, beautifully evokes small-town life, and a mournful score for cello and oboe--seemingly more appropriate for a 1960s Bergman film--works wonders at creating a wistful atmosphere.

She is simply outstanding here, remarkably in control of every nuance of her performance; already a highly skilled actress, despite having only appeared in 11 films before this one (not counting five television films). For this role, Linney was deservedly nominated for an Academy Award, ultimately losing to Julia Roberts' turn in Erin Brockovich. As a consolation, she DID win the National Society of Film Critics Award, the New York Film Critics Award, and the Toronto Film Critics Association Award for her truly memorable work in this film.

For example, it happened for Jean Arthur in 1935's The Whole Town's Talking, for Ava Gardner in 1946's The Killers, for Susan Hayward in 1947's Smash-up The Story of a Woman, for Marilyn Monroe in 1953's Niagara, for Brigitte Bardot in 1956's ...And God Created Woman. And for modern-day actress Laura Linney, it happened in writer\/director Kenneth Lonergan's 2000 film You Can Count On Me. In the role that put Linney on the radar of the greater public, the actress plays a young single mother of an 8-year-old boy. Samantha Sammy Prescott, when we first meet her, is going through a rough patch in her small (fictitious) town of Scottsville, in upstate New York. Her new boss at the bank (Matthew Broderick) has turned out to be an officious, micromanaging prig; she soon enters into a fairly torrid affair with this unhappily married man (a man with a baby on the way, to boot!) even though an old boyfriend has just proposed to her! And perhaps most distracting and distressing of all, her shiftless, wandering, ne'er-do-well younger brother, Terry (finely played by Mark Ruffalo), has just moved into her house for an extended visit. The unfolding relationships between brother and sister, Terry and his nephew Rudy (Rory Culkin; yes, Macaulay's younger brother), and employee and employer make up the bulk of this sweet, sad picture.Warm and touching, sentimental yet startlingly realistic, the film boasts any number of wonderful scenes.

Such is the case of Cinema Paradiso, the touching story about a boy growing up in Sicilly and how his life is influenced by the cinema in his small rural town. This boy, Toto, builds a deep friendship with the cinema's projectionist, Alfredo. The film begins with Toto as a grown man, now a successful filmmaker, reflecting on his childhood and the things that influenced him in order to get him where he is today. This is one of those movies that is truly beautiful. It is so moving, so powerful, and, like I already said, one can't help but fall in love with it.Cinema Paradiso is the kind of film that seems simple enough on the outside. It is a film about a boy growing up. But the film weaves so many things into this boy's life and we grow a strong connection to him and the people around him. We develop a deep understanding of all the characters in this film and what roles they play in Toto's life and how they all change and grow along with Toto. The relationship that builds between Toto and Alfredo is one of the most compelling and touching tales of human compassion you'll ever find. It molds Cinema Paradiso into a bold and beautiful film with such a strong heart and powerful mind.This is one of those films that moves along with such grace and such delightful ease that your love for the film only grows as the characters grow. It is a wonderfully paced and exquisitely scripted film that moves along at a light hearted pace, never faltering and never becoming stale or redundant. It is a consistently moving tale of human emotion and connection that hearkens back to a simpler time of cinema, a time filled with more grace, love, and compassion towards human beings. I feel that this is a film that resents the gritty violent world of cinema that today's generation has created. Cinema Paradiso is a film about love. It is one that casts out hate and stifles modern cinema's dark disposition. I personally don't take Cinema Paradiso's side because I love dark and gritty films, but I still respect this film for the high quality piece of art that it most certainly is.It's not to say that Cinema Paradiso is all flowers and rainbows. It certainly has a side to it that isn't necessarily dark, just realistic. It deals with the simple facts of life that tragedies occur and people die. You can't avoid these things and Cinema Paradiso isn't a disillusioned film that thinks the world is all fun and games. And that relates back to how human of a film Cinema Paradiso is. It is an incredibly moving story that doesn't find it necessary to be melodramatic. It is dramatic, of course, but in such a way that highlights its beauty and brings out all the positive qualities of this film's story. It is a truly excellent film.

Our Cousin Bette gets there, but she chooses another road, perhaps more hazardous, but infinitely more entertaining for us. This fascinating tale is about a relative who is treated poorly by everyone in her aristocratic family, while they themselves live in debt, denial, and high fashion. Jessica Lange plays the title character with a cynical smirk, as though she's daring every one to call her out, yet she knows &#x96; only too well - that people are so consumed by their own personal dramas that they ignore the fine details.Described as the bad seed who refused to blossom, Bette is the sister of Adeline, who languidly takes her time dying, while instructing her spinster sibling as to what flowers to lay on her casket. One look at the two &#x96; Adeline in her death-bed finery and Bette, in a basic drab dress, devoid of any adornment &#x96; and it's all too evident where the balance of power resides. Bette (to Jenny) How could you know? You don't know who I was sacrificed to &#x96; to Adeline. They slapped me and caressed her. I went dressed like a wretch and she like a fine lady. Adeline, the garden, peel the vegetables, Bette. She never lifted a finger except to tie her ribbons.Describing herself as a country peasant, Bette lives in the slums of Paris, working as a costume seamstress to the reigning burlesque star of the day, Jenny Cadine (played by Elizabeth Shue), who vainly shows off her derrière before every final curtain is rung down. Jenny puts off the ticking clock of time by enjoying the attentions of her many rich &#x96; and generous - admirers, yet one fateful day encounters her worst nightmare.Jenny I'm 24&#x85;I may as well be dead.Bette You were 24 years old yesterday and it didn't seem to bother you then. Jenny Today, while I was walking in the park, I came across a hideous old woman, face swollen and scratched; she stank of stale wine and sweat. In her filthy tresses she had placed a beauty patch, one red camellia I knew at once who she was - she was known as Carabine, the most famous courtesan in Paris. Everyone envied her dazzling shoulders, her milky skin. She had a neck so smooth it might have been turned on a lathe. Her trademark was a red beauty patch, a red camellia.'Carabine? Is that you?', I asked. 'No, there is no Carabine, she has left me.' Originally a novel by French author, Honore de Balzac, this modern version boasts an international cast of talent. Bob Hoskins (Cesar Crevel), Hugh Laurie (Baron Hector Hulot), Aden Young (Wenceslas), Kelly Macdonald (Hortense Hulot), and Geraldine Chaplin (Adeline Hulot) all twist and turn in time to Bette's song of vengeance. Set in Paris, during the pre-revolutionary period of 1846, screenwriters Seifert and Tarr turn Balzac's morality tale into a microcosm of the class resentments barely simmering just beneath the pearls and petticoats of Bette's shadow world. Yet she's nothing if not flexible, as she revises her best-laid plans in the face of cross and double-cross by family and high society associates alike. Bette I'll see them &#x96; all of them &#x96; in the dust! We're both daughters of the soil, and blood of the voge, and do you trust me, as a sister?Jenny Yes&#x85;Bette And will you help me, as you would a sister?Jenny Yes&#x85;Bette Then you will be the ax and I'll be the hand that wields it.Surrounded by people with their own notions of power, Bette plays nonstop Powernoply until she wins all, while the French Revolution rages. She's able to play upon the passions of her tormentors and deftly manages to wreck her subtle brand of ruthless revenge upon one and all, causing adultery, a duel, physical illness, embezzlement, financial ruin, imprisonment in the Bastille, and a crime of passion - all of which sees her contentedly sewing in the grand house, dressed in her own silken finery, cooing to a child who's the product of this genteel carnage.

Our Cousin Bette gets there, but she chooses another road, perhaps more hazardous, but infinitely more entertaining for us. This fascinating tale is about a relative who is treated poorly by everyone in her aristocratic family, while they themselves live in debt, denial, and high fashion. Jessica Lange plays the title character with a cynical smirk, as though she's daring every one to call her out, yet she knows &#x96; only too well - that people are so consumed by their own personal dramas that they ignore the fine details.Described as the bad seed who refused to blossom, Bette is the sister of Adeline, who languidly takes her time dying, while instructing her spinster sibling as to what flowers to lay on her casket. One look at the two &#x96; Adeline in her death-bed finery and Bette, in a basic drab dress, devoid of any adornment &#x96; and it's all too evident where the balance of power resides. Bette (to Jenny) How could you know? You don't know who I was sacrificed to &#x96; to Adeline. They slapped me and caressed her. I went dressed like a wretch and she like a fine lady. Adeline, the garden, peel the vegetables, Bette. She never lifted a finger except to tie her ribbons.Describing herself as a country peasant, Bette lives in the slums of Paris, working as a costume seamstress to the reigning burlesque star of the day, Jenny Cadine (played by Elizabeth Shue), who vainly shows off her derrière before every final curtain is rung down. Jenny puts off the ticking clock of time by enjoying the attentions of her many rich &#x96; and generous - admirers, yet one fateful day encounters her worst nightmare.Jenny I'm 24&#x85;I may as well be dead.Bette You were 24 years old yesterday and it didn't seem to bother you then. Jenny Today, while I was walking in the park, I came across a hideous old woman, face swollen and scratched; she stank of stale wine and sweat. In her filthy tresses she had placed a beauty patch, one red camellia I knew at once who she was - she was known as Carabine, the most famous courtesan in Paris. Everyone envied her dazzling shoulders, her milky skin. She had a neck so smooth it might have been turned on a lathe. Her trademark was a red beauty patch, a red camellia.'Carabine? Is that you?', I asked. 'No, there is no Carabine, she has left me.' Originally a novel by French author, Honore de Balzac, this modern version boasts an international cast of talent.

This movie has been a part of my life since I was an infant. I am now 18, which has given me plenty of time to ponder why this film has been and continues to be a huge success. I think it's so popular for one reason It appeals to both young and old film viewers, and here's why.First, for kids, it has great music, it's funny, and has great characters, voiced by an extraordinary cast, which are qualities that make a great animated film. It's easy for an animated film to entertain children, but it's really something when adults are touched by it as well. I think one of the reasons adults like this movie so much is that it does not act like a children's film. It acts like a drama made for adults. The plot is fairly simple, but its themes, emotion, and the psychology of the characters within are things that only mature audiences will truly understand. The plot is basically about a young cub, named Simba. He loves his father, Mufasa, is eager to become king one day, and is fascinated by all he sees and hears. His life takes a very bad turn when his uncle, Scar, kills his father in order to gain the throne. He sends the cub into exile. Simba meets some new friends, Timon and Pumbaa, who raise him with a no worries lifestyle until his best friend from home, Nala, and a wise baboon, Rafiki, encourage him to return home and claim his rightful place as king. As I said, this plot is very basic. However, what is not so basic is the feelings of guilt that Simba feels for the death of his father and the psychological trauma that he has to endure for the rest of the film. Again, what is not so simple is the themes. Simba's father appears to him in the clouds and tells him Remember who you are. This message basically states that a person cannot shirk their responsibilities, a message that a toddler cannot begin to understand. In addition to that, the film sums up what life is all about Going through hard times, dealing with it, and coming out stronger because you endured it. I think the adults that watch this film grasp that concept and appreciate it. My own grandmother, who's in her eighties, bought her own copy of this film!In addition to these things, the film has other elements that cannot be ignored. The first is definitely the wonderful music and songs. Hans Zimmer made the score for this film and won a much deserved Oscar for it. Elton John and Tim Rice also won Oscars for their brilliant work on this film. The songs that they created, like Circle of Life, Hakuna Matata, and Can You Feel the Love Tonight, are so well written that you can't help but be touched by them. The African words sung by Lebo M. contribute highly to the majesty of the film. When Lebo's team first sings, you automatically know that you're in Africa. From his birth to his ascension as king, Simba's journey is wondrously captured through the music and songs that the film provides. Another thing that makes this film so wonderful is the animation. Every single tree, animal, and background that appears on the screen is a stunning work of art. People that do not like this movie will usually admit that the animation is absolutely stunning. It has to be wonderful when the animators actually went to Africa and brought lions into their studio! While all of the other things about this film are wonderful, my personal favorite is the villain, Scar. He is so wonderfully voiced, animated, and brought to life that you love him, hate him, and may even be scared by him all at once. Jeremy Irons, Andreas Deja, and everyone else who worked on this character created one of the best villains in film history. He is the only animated villain to be nominated for an MTV best villain award, and is widely considered to be one of the best Disney villains of all time. Scar is so magnificent that he is in the same category with Hannibal Lecter and Ledger's Joker. The Lion King has many wonderful things that make it spectacular, but, for me, it would not be the same without Scar. A very close second to Scar is Mufasa. He is so incredibly voiced that I cannot imagine anyone else playing him. James Earl Jones brings the qualities of a commanding leader and a wonderful, loving father at the same time to this character that you can't help but feel sad when he is killed. These two characters alone make the film worth seeing. Add everything else that is great about it, and you have one of the best films ever made.The Lion King has been entertaining audiences for 17 years and will do so for many years more. With its great vocal talent, animation, songs, music, and themes, the Lion King has earned its spot in IMDb's top 250 films ever made. I do not thing it will be leaving the list any time soon. It's a real shame that it was not nominated for best picture. I highly recommend this film for anyone who wishes to see a children's film that goes beyond the typical feel good animated film. With the possible exception of Beauty and the Beast, this is definitely the King of all animated films! If you haven't seen it, in 2D or 3D, I strongly encourage you to do so. You won't regret it!

The main character Sydney is a reporter who is out in Cambodia covering the war. Sydney's close friend and translator Dith helps Sydney out of several dangerous situations. They are either in a peaceful embassy or held captive by the Cambodian army. Sydney escapes by switching a French passport while Dith's passport picture turns gray and has no choice but to be turned over to the Cambodian army. Dith ends up in a concentration camp run by child soldiers while Sydney is winning an award for his literary works for his time in Cambodia. Dith eventually escapes with the help of one of the camp leaders he meets during his first escape. With a map and money secretly given to him, he escapes to a hospital camp where he is rescued by Sydney. The quality of the film was extremely poor. A lot of the time the movie was in a different language without subtitles. This movie was about history and started off with no background of what was going on. I understood it was a war in Cambodia but I thought it was between Cambodia and the United States by how the beginning of the movie interpreted things. The main characters were in danger one second than randomly they were in a peaceful embassy. How could one go from about to being killed to a peaceful serene environment? The use of animals during this film seemed to be very cruel, I don't know if it was a special effect when the cow was cut open on its neck but it seemed to be real. Also the faux bombing and intentional startling of animals seemed to be unnecessary.I think this movie is not an accurate depiction of the Cambodian civil war, with that said I cannot say it is important for an Emerson student to see this film.

The film paints a picture of him that is the absolute truth He was a man who won India its independence from Britain without killing a single person. One of the most remarkable things about this film is the way it depicts Gandhi's actions when the people he loved so much fought with each other. Whenever violence started to occur, he would fast until it stopped. His people loved him so much for all he did for them that they stopped their violent behavior to save his life. This movie is so powerful in that it makes you love, admire, and respect the man that Gandhi was. You rejoice with him when he triumphs, and you grieve with him when he suffers. This film won Attenborough an Oscar for his directing, Kingsley one for his acting, and won Best Picture. It deserved all three. If you would like to meet Gandhi, watch this film!

It depicts who he was as a leader, as a man, and as a husband. The film paints a picture of him that is the absolute truth He was a man who won India its independence from Britain without killing a single person. One of the most remarkable things about this film is the way it depicts Gandhi's actions when the people he loved so much fought with each other. Whenever violence started to occur, he would fast until it stopped. His people loved him so much for all he did for them that they stopped their violent behavior to save his life. This movie is so powerful in that it makes you love, admire, and respect the man that Gandhi was. You rejoice with him when he triumphs, and you grieve with him when he suffers.
