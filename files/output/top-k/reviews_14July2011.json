[{"date":"14 July 2011","score":"","review":" The exotic locale and mysterious characters invite the inevitable comparison to Casablanca, though my reading of other reviews on this board would suggest that the more appropriate comparison to Bogart's film would be the French original, Pepe le Moko. Since I haven't seen that one (at least yet), I'll have to confine my comments strictly to Algiers.To my mind, the picture doesn't approach the all around sense of romantic intrigue offered by Bogey and Bergman, but in the interest of full disclosure, Casablanca is my favorite film of all time, so one could say I have some bias. Leonid Kinskey is but the thinnest of threads between the pictures, having appeared in both, and it's interesting how similar his mannerisms and affectations are here even though he's portraying an Arab. The film probably could have used more signature character types like Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Claude Rains, because even though Pepe's goons seemed a rugged bunch, they just didn't appear charismatic enough for the Casbah, 'a melting pot for all the sins of the Earth'. I guess since I've seen Alan Hale and Gene Lockhart in so many other pictures, I couldn't shake the idea that they were just terribly miscast here.As for the ladies, Hedy Lamarr always succeeds in creating romantic tension in her films, but for my money (at least in this picture), Pepe needed to have his head examined for turning his back on Sigrid Gurie's Ines. I'm pretty sure 'smokin' hot' was never used to describe an actress in the Thirties, but it's the 2010's now, and that's how I see it.

On balance though, Algiers has it's merits as an intriguing story with an exotic flair.

Of course, the list would be incomplete without the mention of Michael Curtiz' masterful direction, the dazzling shadowy cinematography and the Esptein twins' perfect script that lurched the film into Pop-Culture  Here's looking at you, kid, We'll always have Paris and so many unforgettable lines that became catchphrases on their own.

Ilsa ran out of Rick who, like most of the refugees, escaped from the German invasion leaving Paris to Marseilles, then Marseilles to Oran, and from Oran to Casablanca, in French Morocco, freed from the German control, to get visas to the neutral Portugal, the only way to America.

She lives in an apartment with her lover (Kevin Kline) and soon the two of them strike up a relationship with a Southern writer (Peter MacNicol) who she soon shares some secrets of her past with. SOPHIE'S CHOICE is probably best remembered for the choice the lead character is forced to take over two-hours into the picture and it's easy to see why because the scene in question is without a doubt one of the most haunting and chilling of anything you're going to see in any movie. I won't ruin what exactly happens but the scene lasts just a couple minutes but the horror and anguish in it are pretty much untouched by countless other films that have tried to display as much power. A lot of the greatness in the film belongs to Streep who clearly deserved her Best Actress Oscar. There's a lot of reasons the performance is so great and of course one of them is the magic that Streep is able to do with the accent. I've always been amazed at how well she could dig into an accent and make it come off so believable but the way she does it here really brings this character to life and you never once feel you're watching an actor learning how to speak this accent but instead you feel as if you're watching a real person. The emotional and psychological ranges that Streep go through are quite remarkable as well and especially in the before mentioned choice that she's given and there's another powerful sequence when she first starts to tell her story. Just take a look at Streep's eyes as she's telling this story and you can see the horror and fear in them. Kline is also quite impressive as he plays a mentally disturbed man and I thought he did a very admirable job being able to be charming in one scene and a complete snake in the next. MacNicol never seems to get enough credit but he really carries the picture the majority of the time as he's in it the most and really plays well against Streep. Director Alan J. Pakula handles the material quite well and his tenderness to the story comes across just fine. The one complaint I'd have against the film is that at times it seems to lose focus of the story and after the picture was done I couldn't help but think there was at least fifteen-minutes that could have been left out of the movie and it would have made it flow a lot better and not take away any of the overall impact.

I see no drawbacks in this charming gem. Of course the Lelievre family deserves accolades for being so haughty and predictable, we all know or have befriended people like them. Georges overacts a bit, but is so funny one forgives him. Jacqueline Bisset, we all know it, is one of the most elegant women on earth, which makes her fit to her role like a comfortable glove, or one of her splendid dresses worn by her. Just as beautiful Virginie Ledoyen, from En plein coeur among others, plays here a character completely different from the aforementioned film, a rebellious daughter with a social conscience. Dr. Cleckley on his famous treatise on psychopathy, Mask of sanity, writes about how a schizophrenic can be used\/ predated by a psychopath who uses her as a muscle to do the criminal acts, while she masterminds everything. Having watched the film again, it is my contention we witness an alliance of the sort in this film. Use of classical music is intelligent you'll never listen to Mozart's Don Giovanni or Britten's Cello Concerto again without remembering this film and probably, feeling some tension (if you're like me at least).My favourite character is the Priest. Like in most Chabrol's films, you can expect his portrayal of the church to be far from unbiased, but in this case at least it's so ridiculous it's funny. Watch his spectacles, and pompous way of talking and you can almost see old man Chabrol winking at us. I agree with IMDb reviewer epeck15 that Sandrine's jerky and stiff physical mannerisms plus that we can also feel her almost childlike panic creates a bond that's hard to forget afterwards. He\/ she mentions sociopathy twice in the review too.Watch twice at least, leaving some time in between. Like a sip of fine Indian tea, this film only gets better each time you view it.

Here you have a great setup, and it is followed thru for the vast majority of the sequels. In saying so I might as well mention that in my opinion the most perfect trilogies in all of movie history are the Toy Story films, the original Star Wars, and my beloved Evil Dead series. It's debatable whether one likes Return of the Jedi, Temple of Doom, or Army of Darkness, but either way none of those films caused the respective series to crash and burn like Batman Forever.The Last Crusade is an epic success on so many levels it could very well be the best of all three. First off, you get to see Indiana Jones as a kid which was just an awesome sequence. Secondly, it's such an incredibly strong cast. Harrison ford and Sean Connery play off each other so well the father-son concept is both comedic yet emotional. I just never tire of their scenes together. Returning are both Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody and John Rhys Davies as Sallah, contributing nicely. Alison Doody may be my favorite actress of the three. Karen Allen was pretty awesome, I never really cared for Kate Capshaw, but Doody has a sexy charm to her that appeals the most to me because she pulls of the role of the villainess so well. The joke of how promiscuous she is never gets old. Michael Byrne was pretty menacing, and I really liked the character played by Kevork Malikyan.

It's often sophisticated yet always fun, and the awe-inspiring action scenes are some of the best out of frankly all four. The score by John Williams is amazing, adding to the mystic quite nicely.

They were low budget films that they went out of their way to create this incredible fantasy world with well made special effects that drew you into their world and created this twisted fantasy world. When a film doesn't have a huge backing or Hollywood money I think the film makers get to do more creatively and have to work with less and that is what can make or break an indie film especially a horror indie film. So enter Hellraiser 3 which you can absolutely tell was the film where they started to get Hollywood money. The special effects are a little less realistic and more computer generated. The story is a little more mainstream and same with the characters. Sadly we also lose the main character of Kirsty Cotton who was the Hellraiser scream queen from one and two although fortunately she is shown in a small segment to help move the story along. Hellraiser 3 isn't bad and it still keeps the continuity going which is great but I felt like it sort of trivialized Pinhead and made him the joke rather than the evil killer.Kevin Bernhardt is the sleazy club owner who is sucked into Pinhead's evil world of lust and pain. His character is vapid and emotionless and basically just there to be the evil human villain which I suppose he accomplishes. Terry Farrell is our new heroine and she does well as the strong headstrong reporter. Her connection to Pinhead's character works well and the investigation she does carries the story well. Paula Marshall is decent as the lost homeless girl being used and abused by Bernhardt's character. Marshall and Farrell have good chemistry together and I think are underused as a team. Of course Doug Bradley returns to his signature role as Pinhead and his real life counterpart Elliot Spencer. Bradley embodies Pinhead and is certainly a horror master in character. I cannot imagine anyone else playing Pinhead. The voice, his behaviour and the entire character is twisted and disturbing even though Hellraiser 3 made him seem a little less mysterious and evil and more mainstream.One of the highlights of the film and perhaps some might think as a stumble is the addition of the creative, twisted, and almost humorous 'new' cennobites created by the puzzle box. Camerahead (played by Ken Carpenter) who also plays Farrell's human camera man before being turned, CD the DJ (my favourite as he has some incredibly gory kills with flashy saw like CD's), and Barbie Cennobite (a bartender turned killer). The climatic scene of the three cennobites attacking civilians in the street is without a doubt a cool scene although as mentioned very Hollywood. But for me it did not ruin the film, it simply made it a little more mainstream. It didn't hold the true level of fear and mystery and gore that the first two films did. Director Anthony Hickox started with some truly great really bad B-Movie horror films so this was right up his alley at the time but he definitely slipped into just straight up bad B-Movies which is unfortunate because I do see some talent here. If you're a true Hellraiser fan obviously this one might offend your senses but for a third instalment and as a huge horror buff I didn't mind this one bit. It was worthy albeit different than the previous ones. The series may be stepping downwards but its a slow stepping so not so bad. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"14 July 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" What made Hellraiser one and two brilliant besides the direct hand that Clive Barker had in it was the special effects.

The reason why I had such doubts, is because the story is set in the 17th century and is about village life.

But, after a short while, you get into the mood, and the story gets really interesting. Even though stories about witchcraft in the village and the life of the town's folk aren't the most impressive ones, this one is quite original. One of the ideas of the movie is that the majority of people are dull and dumb and have poor judgment. And if then, there stand a decent man in the crowd of idiots, he is powerless against them because one man is not a match against an angry mob. And even though this seems unfair, it is the truth. That is the cruel reality. And that is what the movie is about. So anyone who likes stories by Dostojevsky, Camus or Kafka, will definitely enjoy the movie for it's impressive existential ideas.

It gives the moral majority something to do other than examine each Disney film for subliminal messages. I found it refreshing to actually see this kind of film refuse to pull its punches. It's an action film without tapping into the over-sentimental gushy stuff that usually turns kids off anyway. This is a war. Death and violence are part of it. Will it effect the children that watch it. Maybe, but I don't know which way. I saw first saw the film when I was 7. I saw all of my favourites get blown apart. I saw my absolute, total, complete and utter hero, the person that personified all that was good and noble to me (you know who I mean) get killed saving his friends in an ultimate display of bravery and courage. I cried. My mum cried. I still do. I think that one moment made me more afraid and ashamed of death and destruction than a dozen Private Ryans.The animation is top notch, there's an amazing soundtrack and the voice talent is good too. Not perfect, but Nimoy's portrayal of Galvatron is incredible. Especially when you consider that it was probably done as a 'For the money not the art' job. The script isn't bad either. It has a host of sharp, quotable one-liners that would put Bruce Willis to shame (I've got better things to do tonight than die.) The story is a rip off of Star Wars but what isn't and who cares? It's cool. The animation is superb. I said that earlier but I really do believe that it's better than Disney at some points. Certainly better than the average output at the time. It doesn't compare with today's graphics but it hasn't aged badly at all.

One of these individuals is Jack Nicholson's Freddy Gale; a man, whose daughter is Emily and who was killed in that driving incident five years ago, whom is initially revealed as someone combating whatever grief he experiences by frequenting strip clubs so as to meet with his equally sleazy colleagues and which usually leads to the spending of a night with one of the performers. Freddy is the guy we're inclined towards siding with out of victimisation, but he is, in actual fact, a sleazy and unlikeable individual; with the perpetrator of the death coming across as a little bit more than the faceless, drink driving murderer we're, again, naturally inclined towards labelling as such.It's not as if we feel Freddy doesn't care, indeed he has the anniversary of his daughter's death vehemently stencilled in on his calender; while his clinicalness is exemplified in his dealing with a minute employee issue early on at his jewellers in an effective and shrewed manner. Freddy's lifestyle acts as something to sooth the pain, since his ex-wife, in Anjelica Huston's Mary, is seen during that opening therapy session born out of Emily's death; Penn cutting back and forth from such sequences at such places juxtaposing the content and alluding to a harsh duality in dealing with grief. The turntable which will unsettle the balance in each of these people's lives arrives in the form of David Morse's John Booth, the man who was responsible for Emily's death and is now out of prison after his stretch for it.

Indeed, his parents seem like gentle folk and still connect with each other at the age they're at, a far cry from Freddy and Mary on the other strand who're a lot younger but much further apart.Freddy, blinded by some vengeful rage, as well as the seemingly still prominent escalating need to prove his masculinity following the decimation of his marriage, and after so much time spent with women and in those specific locales with other men, tracks Booth with the intent to kill him. The men reach a compromise that sees Booth suggest he come back to his trailer-home in three days time to challenge him if he still wants blood to be spilt.

Like other post-noir, it is about the attempt to recreate a reality and surmise truth in the face of uncertainty (the film opens with a disembodied voice demandingly asking tell me what happened).Being a semi-auteur, Soderbergh then semi-delivers on the promise of this. He dismantles the fabrics of this story being told to us and teases us with various points of view, but once pieced together it is the complete picture. It was merely a playful ruse roundly solved, like the Nouvelle Vague favored.Terrence Stamp is great as the avenging father. You can imagine someone like Christopher Walken tearing through the role. Stamp relishes his part but also keeps stuff inside. It's all about precariously potent balance; a man vaguely amused at the cards dealt him by fate, vaguely pontificating on a life gone by, vaguely seething with revenge.It reminds me of Memento in a way, the mistrust and danger in plain sunlight. But mostly the broken man trying to effect control upon an unknown world, until eventually realizing all the bloody effort was for nothing and that the agent powering the illusion was, in fact, himself.

The movie is stuck in the middle of its own vicious circle.And that's my personal dilemma, I was thrilled by the exhilarating prologue and its sardonic social commentary, then the constitution of the underground 'Fight Club' movement intrigued me, but when the concept became a movement that mobilized more masses, and indoctrinated them through an anti-social movement, and a physical self-improvement that flirted with eugenics, I didn't get it, is fascism the answer to liberalism? Or maybe the movie challenged my intelligence and invited me to question my personal approach to both alienating tendencies, highlighting the danger of one through the consequences of the other, with one hell of a prophetic ending.

The past is over, and there's no future, so the best you can do is seize the day, the night, and empty your bank account to fill your precious living room with some Swedish nonsensical-trema-named furniture. I buy therefore I am this is today's Cogito. Marx defined you through your productive value either you belonged to the working masses, or the exploiting bourgeoisie. Now, the Dow Jones defines you as a member of the spending masses. You're defined by what you consume, what you own, and what you own ends up owing you. You're owned, man! *** I'm David's male fantasy ***You become yourself when you deviate from the model that society dictates to you. The best option is to always take the opposite way. Possession is alienation stop buying. Self-improvement is masturbation destroy yourself. Society teaches that fighting and hurting are bad, how can you know yourself if you've never been in a fight? Don't be afraid of blood, scars, pain, these natural scares will cement your spirit. Fear is the lesson about courage, overcome your fear so you can be a man. In a fight, we're all equal, no shirts, no ties, no blue or white collars, no hierarchy; we're all men, united in the same spirit, as a generation lost in no-space, raised by executive women and executed in the altar of liberalism. We must conquer our manhood again. Power, muscles, sweat, testosterone &#x85; *** I'm David's realistic subconscious ***I want to identify with these guys, to feel the strength to reject and the ability to project myself as a member of this glorious and virile fraternity. But I tried to punch a guy once, I nearly broke my bones, and he nearly sent me to coma by one pinch in the face. Pain hurts to tears. I wanted to become different, I ended up disfigured. Pain hurts, blood is ugly, and sweat stinks. I was fired, I wasn't contributing to the economy anymore, I had my pride. But it couldn't buy me anything. It doesn't matter, whatever you own &#x85; yeah, I know but is everything really so bad? Yes it is, what do you want to be, a prototype? Like these perfect guys in the Gucci underwear advertisement, is that what men look alike? Well Tyler sure does. Yeah but it's a representation, he's just an idealization of what the narrator wants to be. Well, Norton isn't bad-looking either. Well, look at the 'Fight Club' members, they're all average Joes with fat bellies and &#x85; um &#x85; *** I'm David's manipulative impulse ***You, poor little schmuck behind your laptop drooling over Brad Pitt's body and fantasizing over being him, you who haven't killed the father yet you dream of knocking out a man who's done nothing to you, as if your fists were made of steel. You can become a man, a member of the Fight Club. All you have to do is to fight, to endure the punches in your face, the blood, the pain, in the modern arena when you'll be either the bull or the toreador. In both cases, you'll win self-respect. Because taking hits is how you learn about resistance. You see, the point is not to help your neighbor, to fight poverty, to help people, but to denounce the dysfunctional aspect of this society, to fight it, to pee on the soup of the guy with the chick, the Rolex and the Ferrari, to shock the innocence with a subliminal phallic image during a fairy tale cartoon, to destroy all the multiple corporate buildings, to exterminate the liberal degeneration of the pointless civilization, to ... STOOOOOOOOOP! I stop here, because you know where I'm getting at  other groups driven by the same fascist hatred managed to destroy their representation of the liberal world, two years later. Call it political fight, but you can't deny the economical roots of the conflict. Now, I come to my point, the movie works because of its unfortunate prophetic value, I'm sure the movie denounced more than supported, but history proved the premonition to be right. But the average viewer doesn't love the movie for these reasons, because if he would, he would hate it.I love Fight Club because I hate it, call it schizophrenia, I call it the 'Fight Club' paradox. It deserves a 01, I gave it a 10. The rest is just intellectual and\/or physical masturbation ... no wonder the tag-line ends with the word 'soap'.
