I knew it was going to be some kind of sci-fi flick, which of all the people I knew raved about. I had my doubts; it's rare, that movies live up to their hype.The first action scene with Carrie-Ann Moss (Trinity) defines the whole film expect unexpected. Actually the very first action scene did redefine action movie genre all together with slick camera movement and freeze time shots. It all is visual eye candy, which has been designed to make you as the viewer gasp your breath.The story goes, that hacker Neo (Keanu Reeves) is seeking for truth. He want's to know what is the Matrix. Soon he is taken for a drive by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity and he learns that the world is not what it seems. Then there are the bad guys, lead by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and his troop of men in black. In the mix there are thrown pits and pieces from various existential philosophy courses and Jesus and Judas theme is strongly present. A kind of modern semi religious\/philosophical mix. Not meant to be taken too seriously, even tough some people seem to do so.I am actually very interested of seeing, how this movie will last the time. Will it be taken as a new Star Wars or will it just fade away and become a cult classic. There is no knowing that.But, my recommendation Lean back and kick your feet up. Munch some popcorn and enjoy, it's easy with this film.

They're like time machines. Glimpses into the past; into the world that my parents inhabited.But in this case it is a fantasy world. In l942, the country, having endured over a decade of economic depression, had just stepped across the threshold into the uncertain and wrenching horror of World War II. An easy sell in those hard times was a variation on the old Cinderella\/Prince Charming story. So ignoring the current political realities and exploiting the great disparities of his day, Mr. Sturges created a fluffy hour and a half diversion based on the premise that some men, as he spares no cliché to point out, are born more equal than others.The story line, unstructured and at times befuddling, is a typical Hollywood hash job. Having been monetarily blessed by her fairy godfather (Robert Dudley as the Weenie King) Mrs. Gerry Jeffers (Claudette Colbert) leaves New York, her hapless husband Tom (Joel McCrea), and all her troubles behind. Aboard a train, (the pumpkin), bound for the fantasyland of Palm Beach, where the stinking rich live the high life (then as now) in a bubble completely divorced from the grueling exigencies of the average Joe's day to day life she meets her Really Rich Guy, John D. Hackensacker III (Rudy Vallee) who buys her everything. Will her looser husband who really loves her win her back? Or will the licentious Princess Centimillia (Mary Astor) get her hooks into him first? The transcendent scene for me was when Rudy Vallee sings Goodnight Sweetheart while Colbert struggles with the zipper on an evening dress that Madonna would die for.Sexual innuendo aside, I found this movie to be neither humorous nor entertaining. Rather it was boorish, predictable, and contrived. The most egregious injury was to those people represented by characters such as Fred Toones, the Club Car bartender, portrayed stereotypically, so as to reinforce and perpetuate the Jim Crow racism of the day. An insult then, an embarrassment now.In fact the whole movie is a celebration of a system of exploitation. The Robber Baron descendant Hackensacker is unbothered by the source of his plenitude. It just is. Sturges, who knew only too well where the bodies were buried in Palm Beach, didn't want to spoil the fun by showing us how such wealth is made and supported. This is after all a fairy tale. A whitewash.Call me a wet blanket but it just amazes me that this kind of tripe could be made during a time of world upheaval, suffering and sacrifice. I think it says something very unflattering about that 1942 Hollywood in general, Sturges in particular, and the audiences who bought into this load. A good movie should not only be literate and technically competent, but compelling and inspiring. Or at least funny. Measures to which this old flick hardly attains. I think I'm being generous in giving it two stars. Nevertheless, its redemption, as with many old things, has come with the years, and its value now lies in the perspective on contemporary life that a viewer can distill from its representations of that 1942 zeitgeist.And for the hopelessly nostalgic like myself, a trip back to a time past.

I want to defend this movie from the readers whom disliked it, even though you all gave good supportive reasons for your negative reviews. There's plenty here that will please certain viewers.First, this horror movie pits a realistic family against credible threats, which makes it easier for the viewer to sympathize with their problems. This is a family of three somewhat neurotic people, so obsessed with having a great time on this vacation that they set you up for the fun of seeing it all be destroyed. The parents are practically fighting with each other to see which one can do a better job of protecting their overly sensitive child. Early on, there's a surprising accident where they hit the deer, and the main thing on their minds is how this might mentally damage their son. Then they find more intimidating problems from several hunters with guns, miffed that these city dwellers have crashed into their prized trophy. Enter Otis, who's obsessively hateful towards George, the protective father, and everything he and his wife and son stand for. This creates a tension that prevails through the rest of the story.I thought the Otis character was very well portrayed as both threatening and realistic; he reminded me of some gym teachers I've feared from junior high school. Meanwhile, George, who's supposed to be watching out for his family's safety, could not foresee what a threat Otis could become. He was all wrapped around the axle that Otis hated him for an accident which wasn't his fault, and he was obsessing about not being able to make peace with him. The incompetence of this protective father is highlighted again when a bullet is shot through his wall. It never occurs to him that it could have hit him, his wife or son, nor does he associate it with Otis, the psychotic hunter, even though we, the viewers, do. Sure, he's upset by the bullet, but not enough to take any precautions against being hit by another one.Then, to add to the fun, the boy sees psychedelic images. I thought that these were entertaining to watch, even though at first I didn't know what was going on. It added to the tensions of this movie to see the boy frightened by his own peculiar illusions, and we wouldn't like this to happen to us either.Don't worry, I'm not trying to analyze the entire movie, but since others have bad-mouthed the sex scene, here is why I thought it was effective. The parents could already see that things were going wrong with their dream trip, the kid was now having wakeful nightmares in his bed, and are the parents aware of this? Of course not They are having a very energetic sex scene. Not only are they oblivious to the fact that their son could easily hear them, and if he happened to leave his bedroom, catch them in the act, but they are also oblivious to Otis, watching, like a spook in their window. It was a good horror movie sex scene; Otis is observing their every move, and he doesn't even care that they may see him. I was wondering what was going on in Otis' mind. It was obviously something perverted, or at least not nice.As for the monster, I think it was an apparition sent by the boy to drive Otis to his destruction. For such a hungry monster, I don't recall it eating anybody. And as for the symbolism in this movie, it reflected upon how easily blind hatred manifests itself in causing intense fear and physical harm to innocent people; the things that good horror movies are made of. In the case of this previously timid child, now he was calling upon supernatural forces to take a deadly revenge.To sum it up, even if it is not quite as great a movie as written up on the DVD box, many horror movie fans should find this worth watching.

This is my favorite movie, my one and only cult movie, and by far the most beautiful I've ever seen. I wish I had already been born in 1968 to be able to see it in a theater! I happened to watch it on TV for the first time in 1986 as a little girl, and I just thought that Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey were the most gorgeous people and the best-matched couple ever. Then I saw it a second time about ten years later, and was so impressed by it that I found it hard to sleep that night, and quickly became obsessed with it. It overwhelmed me in indescribable ways, and still does so today. In fact, whenever I watch this movie, it haunts me for weeks, and never fails to make me feel like crying in the end. It's a bit weird, really. I can't get enough of it, yet I don't want to watch it too often, because it moves me so deeply... There's definitely something about it that makes it very special. As a matter of fact, it's the only movie that brings me joy and sadness at the same time. Firstly, this is the definitive version of Shakespeare's play. Forget Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard, this is the real stuff, this is how it was meant to be, bursting with life and passion! Everything seems perfect in it the sets, the colors and the lavish costumes, the music (there's so much to say about Nino Rota's exceptional score alone!), and the cast of course (not only do we have incredibly realistic and top-notch performances by the two lead actors, but the rest of the cast, including Michael York, Milo O'Shea and John McEnery, is also very good). The extraordinary thing about Leonard and Olivia is that they looked just the way one would imagine Romeo and Juliet, pure, sweet and innocent. Whenever I hear talking about Romeo and Juliet, I can't help thinking about them both. Another extraordinary thing is that Zeffirelli had another actress in mind (with blonde hair!) before he finally chose Olivia after a second test. Neither Olivia nor Leonard were experienced actors, yet they delivered stunning performances. They didn't know each other before filming, but it turned out they had wonderful chemistry on-screen, and definitely set the standard as the perfect Romeo and Juliet. I was not surprised to learn that Leonard fell in love with his co-star during the shooting of the movie. I mean, who could blame him? Nino Rota was a very talented film music composer, but he had never written such a beautiful score beforehand. He was extraordinarily inspired when he wrote this one. Considering all these elements, I think this movie is nothing short of a miracle. Granted, it's an old movie. You can see it was shot in 1968. So what? This doesn't prevent it from being very emotionally powerful. I don't think Zeffirelli could have given a more romantic and poignant rendition of this mythical love story. He filmed the two leading actors with grace and sensitivity, and love has never been better indeed. Besides, I think he perfectly captured the quintessence of the play. What else can I say? I love this movie with all my heart. To me it's a jewel, a work of art. And it has its own universe... it's just mesmerizing.

This doesn't prevent it from being very emotionally powerful. I don't think Zeffirelli could have given a more romantic and poignant rendition of this mythical love story. He filmed the two leading actors with grace and sensitivity, and love has never been better indeed. Besides, I think he perfectly captured the quintessence of the play. What else can I say? I love this movie with all my heart. To me it's a jewel, a work of art. And it has its own universe... it's just mesmerizing.

This is my favorite movie, my one and only cult movie, and by far the most beautiful I've ever seen. I wish I had already been born in 1968 to be able to see it in a theater! I happened to watch it on TV for the first time in 1986 as a little girl, and I just thought that Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey were the most gorgeous people and the best-matched couple ever. Then I saw it a second time about ten years later, and was so impressed by it that I found it hard to sleep that night, and quickly became obsessed with it. It overwhelmed me in indescribable ways, and still does so today. In fact, whenever I watch this movie, it haunts me for weeks, and never fails to make me feel like crying in the end. It's a bit weird, really. I can't get enough of it, yet I don't want to watch it too often, because it moves me so deeply... There's definitely something about it that makes it very special. As a matter of fact, it's the only movie that brings me joy and sadness at the same time. Firstly, this is the definitive version of Shakespeare's play. Forget Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard, this is the real stuff, this is how it was meant to be, bursting with life and passion! Everything seems perfect in it the sets, the colors and the lavish costumes, the music (there's so much to say about Nino Rota's exceptional score alone!), and the cast of course (not only do we have incredibly realistic and top-notch performances by the two lead actors, but the rest of the cast, including Michael York, Milo O'Shea and John McEnery, is also very good). The extraordinary thing about Leonard and Olivia is that they looked just the way one would imagine Romeo and Juliet, pure, sweet and innocent. Whenever I hear talking about Romeo and Juliet, I can't help thinking about them both. Another extraordinary thing is that Zeffirelli had another actress in mind (with blonde hair!) before he finally chose Olivia after a second test. Neither Olivia nor Leonard were experienced actors, yet they delivered stunning performances. They didn't know each other before filming, but it turned out they had wonderful chemistry on-screen, and definitely set the standard as the perfect Romeo and Juliet. I was not surprised to learn that Leonard fell in love with his co-star during the shooting of the movie. I mean, who could blame him? Nino Rota was a very talented film music composer, but he had never written such a beautiful score beforehand. He was extraordinarily inspired when he wrote this one.

The big budget is clear to see with a myriad of special effects and explosions every few minutes. What makes Timecop better though is a decent story, even though it follows the usual revenge theme, a good script, and s decent cast to back up Van Damme.Van Damme stars as Max, a cop with a difference in the future. Time Travelling has been near-perfected, and Max is a Timecop- an elite crime fighter with the special authority to travel through time to stop criminals. Only a few people are authorised to use this technology, but naturally some bad guys get there hands on it and plan to change the past. A few years earlier Max's wife had been murdered. When Max learns of a sinister plot involving Senator McComb, who plans to become President by going back in time, Max takes the law into his own hands and goes back to stop him. This leads to further trouble of course, and Max soon sets out to save his wife as well.The time travelling stuff is handled to an average degree, certainly not as good as in Back to the Future or The Terminator, but it's adequate. Van Damme has enough star quality now to carry the film but Silver and Sara provide strong support. The effects are mostly very good, the action scenes are exciting and there is some honour and a few good one-liners. Probably a good one to watch for people coming to Van Damme movies for the first time as it delivers what it promises and doesn't try to be special.7.5 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 May 2005","score":"7 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" Probably Van Damme's last big hit, Timecop is a mix of action, sci-fi, time-travel, and revenge with the usual roundhouse kicking fun.

Nonetheless, apart from the terrific idea to introduce a creature of nature as an invincible nemesis, this movie lacks a few essential aspects to be labeled masterpiece, in my humble opinion. That, of course, doesn't mean that it isn't a must-see film! Jaws is an exhilarating movie-experience and also an excellent reminder that Spielberg used to make gripping films for adult audiences, rather than dull and childish epics with an overuse of sentiment. The clever screenplay (mostly written by Peter Benchley) neatly divides this film into two parts. The first part is really splendid, with the quiet island community of Amity slowly growing aware of the fact that they've got a serious water-problem on their hands. The first (and severely mutilated) bodies of shark-attack victims begin to wash ashore but the obnoxious mayor initially refuses to acknowledge the problem out of fear tourists will stay away during the summer-opening weekend. This first half is very suspenseful (the opening on the tunes of John Williams' world-famous score!!), the camera-work is exquisite and there's some nice hillbilly-humor in the script. The second half has three specialists going out to sea in order to hunt down and kill the great white shark. Police chief Brody (Scheider), independent sea-hunter Quint (Shaw) and oceanographer Hooper (Dreyfuss) play cat and mouse on open water with an impressive monster they yet don't properly know the enormous proportions of (hence the classic quote You're gonna need a bigger boat when Brody first beholds the shark). Personally, I think this second part is a bit overlong and overall not as involving as the first. However, the character-drawing of our 3 heroes is brilliant and Shaw's Indianapolis-monologue is still very chilling (it took three additional scriptwriters to perfection this legendary speech). The film's climax is very bloody and therefore a rewarding ending.I guess the main reason why I love this movie is because of the trend it started. Steven Spielberg and his film single-handedly launched an endless series of ripoffs and outrageous creature-features that nearly turn every animal on this planet into ravenous monsters. I make a hobby out of tracking down the films that were obviously inspired by this milestone. The sea-monster movies remain the coolest, for sure. There are a lot of worthwhile rip-off's to be found; like Orca &#150; Killer Whale, Pirahna or Alligator but even more stinkers like Tentacles, Tintorera - Tiger Shark or Killer Fish.

This movie ties together all of Smith's other Jersey crew films, with appearances by characters from Clerks through Chasing Amy.While it is true that you won't get all the jokes unless you've seen Smith's other movies, that won't stop a person from enjoying it if they haven't. When I first saw Jay & Silent Bob Strikes Back in theaters, I had only seen Dogma beforehand and I thought it was hilarious. Everyone in this movie puts on an awesome comedic performance, though I think my favorite comes from Will Ferrell as an inept wildlife marshal. If you don't mind some distasteful humor, you've got to see this movie.

Walking out of the theater, I was dumbfounded. I think I was just getting over the shell-shock of seeing the newest movie in a series I have loved since childhood. The lightsaber duels are awesome. The starships are sleek and graceful. CGI creatures populating a giant, new galaxy.Since then, I have noticed that the movie seems to be just that all style and no substance. The movie does have a plot, just not much of one. The planet of Naboo is under siege by the Trade Federation and the Jedi Council sends Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, to sort things out. I once read a review for the movie which called it two hours of trade negotiations, which isn't far from the truth, I guess.My biggest problem with the movie was the acting. Most of the cast gave wooden, emotionless performances, though there were a few exceptions. Natalie Portman, when not decked out in Queenly-gear, seemed almost human. Ray Park, who plays Sith apprentice Darth Maul, is probably my favorite cast member. His job is merely to look menacing and whoop ass, and he does both well. Jake Lloyd was at the opposite end of this spectrum. I personally think he did a terrible job as Anakin Skywalker. It confuses me to think that George Lucas had the opportunity to cast Haley Joel Osment and passed it up. Of course, it is obligational that I mention my contempt for the character of Jar Jar Binks. Binks, and the Gungan race in general, shows how Lucas was trying to appeal to the younger crowds to beef up merchandise sales. I was a little annoyed with the excessive toilet jokes, which I didn't think fit for a Star Wars movie.Despite all this, I still enjoy this movie to an extent. The special effects are great and the fight scene choreography is extraordinary. Plus knowing that you are one step further towards the arrival of Darth Vader helps make the movie worth a viewing.

Mostly because of the Geena Davis\/Renny Harlin marriage\/collaboration that created this and the much-maligned Cutthroat Island, which was released the previous year. That was too bad, because The Long Kiss Goodnight is by far the best of the 2, and an incredible film.Davis plays Samantha Caine, a sweet school teacher who lives in a town in New England with her boyfriend (Tom Amandes) and daughter (Yvonne Zima). The only wrinkle in her perfect life is the fact that she has no inkling of her past life. She was found unconscious and pregnant 8 years before. Samantha's life at this point is as bland as low-fat cookies, until a car accident triggers memories and skills. Soon, someone shows up at her door, attempting to kill her. What could possibly be the reason for this? Seems that sweet-as-sugar Samantha is really deadly-as-cyanide Charley Baltimore, government assassin. With the help of Mitch (The excellent as always Samuel L. Jackson), Charlie begins to discover why particular persons want her dead, especially the mysterious Timothy (Craig Bierko).The film has some fantastic scenes. 4 of my favorites 1) The shootout at the station. When Samantha and Mitch take a dive out a window, and she shoots through the ice so they can land in the water instead of splattering on the ice. Great! 2) When Samantha regains her memory. Samantha is tied to a waterwheel, stripped to her slip, and being dunked into freezing cold water. You see her change each time she is dunked, from helpless Samantha to killer Charly.3) The Rebirth of Charly With the cool song She's Not There being used to good effect, Charly is going through a makeover, changing her hair, putting on the makeup, and putting the moves on a confused and bruised Mitch. And the thing she does with the shot glass? Cool! 4) The bomb at the border. The sheer magnitude of the explosion boggles the mind as you watch Mitch, Charly and her daughter trying to outrace it.This is one of Harlin's best films and it's gotten a bad rap. This film is worth looking at. If you ever decide to have a Harlin film fest (And somewhere, someone may.), then this should be on it.

It is especially interesting to compare it to Vertigo. I personally like Marnie much better. Unlike Vertigo, the Marnie plot is pretty much straight-forward without the non-credibility factors that undermine Vertigo. Particularly satisfying is that fact that Mark Rutland's obsession is for a normal sexual life, unlike Scotty Ferguson who's obsession is asexual, fantasy driven, and possibly insane! (Make that definitely insane!).But...as in Vertigo, Hitchcock's artistic excesses barely allow the film to rise above the level of an art film. The obvious studio sets and somewhat mechanical narrative style detract from some of the power of the story, and it's really too bad. It had all the makings of a real classic, but once again, Hitchcock let it slip through his grasp. Hitchcock alternates between realistic and phony stage prop backgrounds, which distract you from the story. The ship dock scene, the beginning of the nightmare scene, and the flashback at the end seem very crude and disjointed. It works better after repeated viewings, but the first time you see them-Crudity Inc.! (Very similar to the crude style in the dream sequence of Vertigo=throw some things into a kaleidescope and start turning! Communication...not!!) The subtle but satisfactory ending is much better than a lot of his films (especially Vertigo), and at least allows the viewer to feel good about Marnie's fate. If nothing else, Hitchcock's artistic excesses in this film confirm the fact that all of the artistic excesses in Vertigo were deliberate, not accidental, confirming the fact that my review at that site may have some real validity. Overall I give it an 8.5.

The difference is obvious.8 out of 10 ","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"7 May 2005","score":"7 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":" ***SPOILERS*** In The Hood three homeboys Stack Ball & Bulldog are mysteriously drawn to the Simms Funeral Home to get their hands on a stash of, what they call illegal drugs in gangster jive, The Sh*t thats supposedly hidden there. Forcing their way in they get the owner of the place the mortician Mr. Simms to take them where The Sh*t is threatening to murder him if he doesn't do business with them and lead them to it. Mr. Simms, who's new in the business of drug selling and who's also a bit weird and screwy but, for some strange reason, seems to show no fear at all of these dangerous hoodlums! Who are all armed with handguns and ready to use them in an instant. Simms tells the homeboys that they'll get The Sh*t all right in fact by the time the night is over they'll be knee deep in The Sh*t. But before he takes them to where  The Sh*t is he's got a few nice little stories to tell them about some of the stiffs, that are now being prepared for burial in his funeral home, stories that he calls Tales from the Hood. The first tale that Simms tells the hoodlums is about a former black cop Clarence who went insane from guilt in not doing anything to save the life of a popular black community activist Martin Moorehouse when he was brutally beaten and then shot up with drugs, that caused him to die from an overdose, by three of his fellow cops. Clarence ended up murdering the three criminally-corrupt policemen on the one year anniversary of Moorehouses murder and then lost his mind and later his life. The next Tale from The Hood is about little Walter who's dad Mr. Johnson constantly and brutally beats him and his mom to a pulp for the slightest reason. Back in school a bully who also beat up Walter had for some strange reason both his arms and legs broken when Walter drew a picture of him and then crushed it. Having his teacher Mr. Garvy go to see Mr. Johnson about Walter's fears of going home Mr. Johnson shows up and, true to his nature, starts to attack the teacher as well as Walter and his mom. The brutal and mindless Mr. Johnson soon ends up broken to pieces and burned to a crisp by Walter doing the same thing to him like he did back in school to the bully with his strange and destructive powers. The third Tale from the Hood has to do with this racist politician Duke Metger who bought this old southern plantation, that he'll run his campaign out of, where the owner had all his slaves slaughtered just before they were to be set free by the Union Army after the Civil War. Stirring from their graves the souls of the murdered slaves came to life by taking over a number of voodoo dolls buried in the mansion who then vengefully and ferociously do the arrogant Metger in.And finally the last Tale from the Hood is about local homeboy gang-banger Crazy K which seemed to strike a cord with the three thugs. Crazy K was brutally shot down in the streets by his fellow homeboys who he was at war with over the control of the already mentioned Sh*t that killed so many in The Hood, like black atavist Moorehouse, over the years. The story about Crazy K really shook up the three who it turned out where the one's who did in the vicious and unrepentant Crazy K. Now with all the tales and stories from The Hood finished Mr. Simms takes the three hoods, who by now are getting very inpatient with him, down to the cellar to get the valuable Sh*t all for themselves. And they do get The Sh*t but it's not The Sh*t that they expected! And worst of all Mr. Simms didn't turn out to be the wacky harmless and non-offensive eccentric that they thought that he was! But The Sh*t and the person-Mr. Simms- who took them to it turned out to be their, the three homeboys, worst darkest and most terrifying nightmare! A nightmare that dwarfs anything that they could have ever imagine in their wildest drug-induced hallucinations to be really Bad in The Hood or for that matter anywhere else!
