Not to worry, it's still a great horror film even if you don't watch it on its' title night. It has been a long time since I last saw it and I had forgotten just how good it was. Yes, it's dated, but that doesn't detract from the way Carpenter draws the audience in to the horrors to come. I'll give you more of my thoughts after this brief summary.We first witness the 6 year old Michael Myers murder his older sister on Halloween night 1963. Flashing forwards 15 years, October 30th, we see him escape the mental institution he has been kept in since then. We are also introduced to Dr. Sam Loomis, who firmly believes Myers to be pure evil. The next day, back in Michael Myers' home town we meet Laurie Strode and her friends Annie Brackett and Lynda van der Klok who are planning their Halloween night. Two of them are babysitting, but there are plans, for two of them at least, to get together with their boyfriends later. Laurie has the feeling someone is watching them though&#x85; and she's right. Dr. Loomis has also arrived in town, he has a feeling also that an old resident may be returning home. I'll leave it there so as not to upset the Spoiler Police (Horror Movie Division).A really well made film with some iconic scenes and a film that is genuinely scary. One of the things that strikes you about it is the music, also written by John Carpenter. It's atmospheric and it has a refrain that everyone knows and associates with this film. All the performances were excellent; Jamie Lee Curtis in her first starring role did a great job as Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasence was great (as ever) as Dr. Sam Loomis. Also worthy of note were; Nancy Kyes as Annie Brackett, P.J. Soles as Lynda van der Klok and Charles Cyphers as Sheriff Leigh Brackett.Of course all the usual horror movie clichés are here, including my pet favourite; walking into a dark room and NOT turning the lights on. Despite this I still very much enjoyed the way Carpenter slowly builds up the tension. The horror is in what he doesn't show on the screen and that is what makes this a properly scary movie.

I myself have read the novel, and I appreciated it as much as the next person, but let's be realistic here; is it really made for the screen? Director Roland Joffe has done the right thing here by adding some extra *umph* to the classic story with the right dose of action and romance - even if many key elements of the novel were altered.First, let's put this into perspective. Yes, Joffe took the title of the book, hinting towards a relatively accurate adaption, which it was not by any means. However, there have been many successful films based on novels that have even used the author's name directly in the title whilst making it just as inaccurate. Example 1 Bram Stoker's Dracula - also starring the wonderful Gary Oldman - TOTALLY strayed from the book but is still a favourite of many. #2 Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Complete filth in my opinion (possibly because Frankenstein's my fav book and Ken Branagh is just such a ham in it), but it was still approved by most critics. Get what I'm saying here? Just because a film is not word-for-word like the book it's based on, it doesn't mean that it isn't any good.Truth be told, I love this film! Yes, yes, I'm a bit of a Gary Oldman fan girl, and yes, seeing his wet, naked, beautiful body made me swoon, but that is NOT the only reason why I loved this film. Honest.Despite the incredible length, Scarlet Letter managed to grab my attention from start to finish. The soundtrack, lighting, costuming, sets, camera work, script . . . it was all fantastic. It had me smiling and giggling at the flirty exchanges between Arthur (Gary Oldman) and Hester (Demi Moore), sighing at the love scenes, biting my nails at the moments where those crazy Puritans showed their (arguably) evil side,reaching for tissues at the tragic moments, and had me actually hiding my face behind a pillow when things got really intense. This to me is the mark of a great film.Another great thing is the performances. The entire cast was incredible - a thing that rarely happens. The stars of the film, Moore and Oldman, were both critically knocked for their performances - Gary for not being 'into the role' and Demi for just, well, sucking. NONSENSE!! Gary, while not in his usual bada$$ and over-the-top crazy element, played the charming and romantic version of Dimmesdale to a T. He really let us feel his torment in having to choose between his moral and spiritual beliefs, and his heart (and I can't stress enough how beautiful he is in this role - okay, hormones are settled now). Demi was equally as wonderful, showing us both the strength of a woman seeking independence from domestic and religious restraints, as well as vulnerability in her inability to actually fight the power so to speak. Both actors had amazing chemistry and passion - passion for their individual beliefs, for their child, and above all, for each other. Simply wonderful. Another stand-out performance was Joan Plowright as Harriot. She portrayed a gentle, warm and kind wisdom like I have never seen before. I felt immediately drawn to her character.*drum roll* Time for the one and only flaw! My main problem is the unnecessary amounts of gore. I won't say how it's gory, but if you haven't seen this yet, consider yourself warned. I understand that this is a device that only makes the film more powerful and intense, but truthfully, it's just plain hard to watch. OH! I just thought of another flaw. Mituba diddling herself with a candlestick. It might sound like a bad Clue scenario, but lo and behold . . . It's just unnecessary.So those are my two cents. If you're a hard-knock fan of the book, try to forget about it when watching this film. It really is great as an independent story, so just let your mind relax and sink into the creative depths of the directors' interpretation. And keep a pillow handy.

Along the way the two men try for the affections of a local groupie (Susan Sarandon) who tries to offer them more than just sex. There's a terrific sequence early in the movie where the Sarandon character takes home the two men and informs them of the rules she has laid down. Each season she takes care of one player and these rules just don't sit right with the veteran player and this leads to one of the funniest speeches from any film of the 80s. BULL DURHAM falls a bit short of being a great film but it's still a very special one that manages to mix in plenty of laughs, some mild romance and of course baseball. I know a lot of people bash this film for not being about baseball or that the sport gets left behind the romance but I've never agreed with this. I think the screenplay by director Ron Shelton does a terrific job at building up the minor league lifestyle and I think the film captures the perfect look and feel of the small town, small stadiums and the small life. I really love how the film manages to put the characters in a situation where the end results can be the same no matter if they're trying for the major leagues or if they're just trying to make it one more game in the minors. The movie is full of wonderful, dirty moments including the type of foul-mouthed profanity that the screenwriter is probably best known for. The screenplay allows all three characters to be so different that it really does seem as if each one is the main character. Costner turns in another wonderful performance here as the catcher who has pretty much done a lot of small things and resents the fact that this rookie could do so much more but he usually just throws it away. The relationship between Costner and Robbins makes for a very fun time and you can't help but enjoy the older\/young brother banter. Both actors are terrific in their parts and really bring them to life. Saradon, a wonderful actress, really gets to go all out here with the charm and even if you object to her groupie status you still can't help but enjoy the character.

","genre":null},{"date":"6 November 2011","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Bull Durham (1988) *** 1\/2 (out of 4) A washed up minor league catcher (Kevin Costner) shows up in Durham where he's been asked to take a major league arm (Tim Robbins) and try to teach him some common sense. Along the way the two men try for the affections of a local groupie (Susan Sarandon) who tries to offer them more than just sex. There's a terrific sequence early in the movie where the Sarandon character takes home the two men and informs them of the rules she has laid down. Each season she takes care of one player and these rules just don't sit right with the veteran player and this leads to one of the funniest speeches from any film of the 80s. BULL DURHAM falls a bit short of being a great film but it's still a very special one that manages to mix in plenty of laughs, some mild romance and of course baseball. I know a lot of people bash this film for not being about baseball or that the sport gets left behind the romance but I've never agreed with this. I think the screenplay by director Ron Shelton does a terrific job at building up the minor league lifestyle and I think the film captures the perfect look and feel of the small town, small stadiums and the small life. I really love how the film manages to put the characters in a situation where the end results can be the same no matter if they're trying for the major leagues or if they're just trying to make it one more game in the minors. The movie is full of wonderful, dirty moments including the type of foul-mouthed profanity that the screenwriter is probably best known for. The screenplay allows all three characters to be so different that it really does seem as if each one is the main character. Costner turns in another wonderful performance here as the catcher who has pretty much done a lot of small things and resents the fact that this rookie could do so much more but he usually just throws it away. The relationship between Costner and Robbins makes for a very fun time and you can't help but enjoy the older\/young brother banter. Both actors are terrific in their parts and really bring them to life. Saradon, a wonderful actress, really gets to go all out here with the charm and even if you object to her groupie status you still can't help but enjoy the character. The film mixes a lot of things but at its heart the thing is just a good comedy. I don't think the romance is as strong as it could have been but this is just a minor issue.

Put simply its a thoroughly watchable affair that grips from the start and breezes by with nary a dull spell. Sadly for all its slick watch-ability its too flawed a work to be all that powerful or memorable but its entertaining at least. If entertainment you seek here you shall find it, but I can certainly see why this is lauded more by genre fans than critics. But the pluses first. Mickey Rourke is the biggest in his role as Harold Angel, private eye on the case. Somewhat cynical and sleazy whilst retaining a sense of righteousness its a spot on performance that impresses more and more as the film goes on and things get darker. A terrific focal point, and the rest of the cast is pretty spiffing too, Robert de Niro is on cool and quiet form as Rourkes wryly sinister employer, the ever classy Charlotte Rampling puts in an elegantly witchy turn and the comely Lisa Bonet makes a splash as a young priestess (who appears in the films most eyebrow raising scene. The film looks super too, from the dark alleyway opening with smoke curling up from beneath onwards there's a great sense of the life of place, of human bustle and animal scuffle, heat and wet, richness and poverty. And within it all is the suggestion of dark, but here lies the films main problem. As horror, as dark piece Angel Heart is never more than efficient. Sure there are grisly sights, ones that escalate during the course of the film to one or two nice shocks. But its all too clean and controlled, where delirious revelry is needed the film offers tight editing, smart framing and restraint, clinical cuts to the meat beneath the surface rather than a better double fisted clawing plunge. And much as the horror has little more than surface charm so does the rest of the film. Plentiful symbolic shots of air conditioners hammer home the plight of mechanisms against inevitability, but there's far more atmosphere than suspense and the films revelations are standard genre theatrics. Fate has a face but offers little more than standard villainy, a white man delves deep into colored circles but racial tensions are minimal, no doubt I'll find even more to pick up on with a second viewing. All this is not meant as seriously heavy criticism by the way, its still one of the easiest watched I've had in the past few months, an hour and three quarters or so whipping along like it was less than half that length well mounted with some aforementioned great aspects and quality moments. Its just rather frustrating to see a quality genre piece with a truly great work suffocating within, and at the close of play I couldn't help but sit back and ponder being let down.

Their story gets more messed up when they meet a strange and sinister character (Robert Blake) that seems to know more about them than themselves and can be in two different places at the same time. What is revealed after that is the wife's murder by the husband who'll later be arrested, and while waiting for his death sentence simply disappears out of his cell and in his place there's a younger guy (Balthazar Getty). And from that it's a whole different story with different characters but somehow is connected with the earlier plot. Those who love David Lynch mysterious puzzles will love this classic. Critics underestimate this film and some audiences to do the opposite with it. It's not a bad film neither a great and spectacular film. What's missing here is a higher purpose, something that would made the whole thing more enjoyable than it is. The plot goes through so many twists that are efficiently put to confuse its audience but it gets lost somewhere at times; it just pretends to be a deeper film than it is, but it's not. No message, no ideas, it's given so little to start a discussion on how great the plot is. However, each person can make better readings than I did, so I won't be arrogant enough to say I'm right and you're wrong. Purely for its aesthetic and the way it is composed, that's what makes of Lost Highway a superb film that holds its viewers from the first minute until the credits roll. It is incredible slow in its first half hour but even so you're already there and there's no way you can't walk out of this movie. It's THAT good! The director thinks big in his public while making this film the soundtrack is absolutely great, one of those that really makes you feel stone cold, fearing what's going to happen next; it's an complex, exciting and thrilling film noir filled with many Lynch references and classic films references as well; it's unmistakable good. It's far more interesting to watch Lost Highway to see how the artist builds his art than to root for what's he making, the story and etc. It's far more daring to enjoy how the auteur creates the paranoia of his characters than the paranoia itself which is just a way to mindless people keep saying how crazy this film was. Lynch always knows how to fools and surprises us, never makes us uninterested or bored, he always pushes the envelope and Lost Highway is filled with those bizarre moments where you keep saying Hold on! trying to connect all the dots and process all the information given to you throughout the experience.The greatest example of how to make an audience really connected with a film, surprised, shocked and excited at the same time is the classic meeting between the mystery man with Bill Pullman, where everything surrounding them stops, silence for a moment and then it's surprise after surprise. The plot is carefully built in its device of manipulate the viewers but it never explain things in satisfying ways, it's a little bit empty. LIke said earlier the way of the artist to make his thing is what makes of this film something really worth seeing but not just that, the acting is equally great, from the minor characters to the some of the more relevant figures. Best of the show Robert Loggia playing an menacing gangster; the fore-mentioned Robert Blake, in a performance that should have gave him some awards and nominations (and as of now, his last acting job); Pullman and Arquette (playing double characters) are quite good, hold the film very well. But the director and\/or his casting personal should hire another actor for the hunky guy played by Getty. While he has some sex appeal I found him a wrong choice for the part, someone good looking enough to make me believe that an blonde femme fatale like Arquette would feel so attracted to. Certainly one of the strangest films of the 1990's and a good one. Take a dare and travel to the darkest paths that this lost highway can lead you to. Enjoy the ride and try not to lose your mind while in it. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 November 2011","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" A saxophonist (Bill Pullman) and his wife (Patricia Arquette) start to receive anonymous video tapes of their house, and each time as each different tapes appear the content starts to change little by little.

What is revealed after that is the wife's murder by the husband who'll later be arrested, and while waiting for his death sentence simply disappears out of his cell and in his place there's a younger guy (Balthazar Getty).
