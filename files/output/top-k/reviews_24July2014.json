A second backup crew is sent to investigate and make some interesting discoveries along the way. Along the way the movie has mystery, suspense, and a handful of other elements thrown in.It's not by far Gary Sinise's best work or anyone else's best work for that matter.

If you wanted, you could probably rip this entire movie apart finding tons of fallacies in the plot and everything else. The direction of this movie is questionable but in between, it has it's good parts. The set design of the NASA spacecraft's and Mars atmosphere is still pretty convincing in 2014. The suspense and dramatic moments are pretty engaging at times. And overall, even after seeing the movie a few times already in my life, I still enjoy sitting through and watching the movie. I won't give away the ending of the film, but personally I did not like it mainly due to CGI reasons... At best, this movie is a 7\/10. It's an average space flick and pretty enjoyable if you have an appeal to science fiction and astronomy. Overall Mission to Mars ends up being a touching story about the human endeavor to reach for the stars. There are certainly better films out there in this department and this isn't entirely the type of film I would add to my blu ray collection, but it's worth at least a stream if you can't find anything else to watch in the the space exploration department. With of all that being said, it would be interesting to see a reboot of this film done properly with some of the poor dialog and CGI revamped. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"24 July 2014","score":"","review":" I first seen this film when I was barely a teenager around when it first came out.

Noticeable Camera work Establishing shots of the spaceship for the first couple of minutes before we are shown the human actors. Followed by a 180º turn around to table with them all eating and foreshadowing. But apart from that there aren't too many other noticeable shots, they are good at showing scale of object compared to people, but you would expect more variation from a movie that is trying to build suspense. But it was made in the late 70's so I can't complain too much Costume Just like the Predator costume, the Xenomorph is a timeless classic. Created by using practical effects only, it is one of the most recognizable fictional aliens there is. Incorrect Science The ship informs them that they have received an acoustic beacon. Acoustics is the science of sound. Sound requires a form of matter to pass through, such as solid, liquid or gas. Sound cannot travel through a vacuum, which space is. Apart from this, there is very little to comment on as the alien's method of reproducing isn't alien in any respect, as there are insects on our own planet which plant their eggs inside another living being until they are ready to hatch.

Overall Feel One ending of this movie had Ripley escaping into the ejection pod, only to find that the alien is already in there and she dies in the end of the movie. That is an ending I would have preferred as it would have prevented the travesty of it's sequels (3&4) which ruined the franchise. The who idea of the Alien is based around insects, it reproduces by planting eggs in a host and having them grow inside the host. They have a hive mind set and they are all male bar the queen who calls the shots. Sadly none of this can be seen in this movie, only in 'Aliens'. The movie takes a while to get interesting, and this is around the 25 minute mark and is because you need time to set up and establish everything, but you won't miss much if you just skip to 25 minutes, only the reason for them being on the planet. Some parts of the movie have stood up great for a 70's movie, and some parts are cheesy and don't work, but it is still a great movie all together and a sci-fi and horror classic.

It didn't leave much of a long-term impact on me, but at least I can say I watched one of the greatest, if not the greatest, sequels in science-fiction history.After failing its mission in T1, another model of the T-800 class sent back in time to kill Sarah Connor, the mother of resistance leader John Connor in the first film before John is even born, is this time sent to protect John, now having become a rebellious adolescent with less-than-pleasant foster parents living in 1990s LA, while Sarah is stuck in what is effectively an asylum, often found working out, preparing for the next encounter with the machines.Another Terminator is also sent back to kill John Connor, and if you thought the T-800 from the first movie was hardcore, the T-1000 is even more of a mean machine. Not only does it possess the murderous super-strength of the T-800, but it is also made of colour-changing liquid metal, so that like X-Men's Mystique, it can transform into any adult-sized human being and assume its identity, while the T-800 is stuck (unashamedly) in Arnie mode.The battle between the two robots from the future will ultimately, indirectly, decide the fate of humanity. While the T-1000 kills anything which stands in his way, the T-800 not only protects John (and will also protect other people, since it will only obey John's orders) but also acts like a father figure towards the boy, since John's biological father, Kyle Reese, sacrificed himself at the climax of T1, before John Connor was even born. This is one of a few ways in which this movie is revolutionary.The CGI visual effects, for 1991, were unbelievable for audiences back then. They made the T-1000's abilities look so real, so scary, but damn cool and made the movie appear to be so far ahead of its time. Terminator 2 won 4 Academy Awards, including best Sound Effects and Visual Effects (Zero surprise there...). As for the cast, Arnold Schwarzenegger is the perfect role for the robotic cyborg that is the T-800. The not as well known Robert Patrick is equally chilling as the T-1000, while Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor and débutante Edward Furlong as Sarah's son John provide very intense performances as the human protagonists.

I spent days, if not more than that, a little haunted by what I had watched. But I watched without regret. When the T-800 stated 'I'll be back' in the first movie, he did indeed come back.

It's a nice film, but certainly not a significant film or a very memorable film. After analyzing it, I think I know the main reason why.Lloyd is infatuated with, and then falls in love with, Diane Court (Ione Skye). For this film to work well, the viewer has to feel that this love is memorable, if not amazing. Lloyd is a nice guy. He has little ambition. But he has this idea that it would be a dream come true if he could get the beautiful, intelligent Diane to go out with him.Diane, as the object of Lloyd's obsession, has to be worthy of that obsession. And this is where the film falls short for me. She is a nice girl. A good girl. A dutiful daughter, academically successful in high school, blah blah blah plain vanilla. I don't see how she justifiably inspires the passion that Lloyd feels for her. Why not? Because she displays little passion herself.Think about it. She has some big issues to contend with. Her valedictorian speech. Life after school (that she is afraid of). Going away to college. A future career. But do we hear her talk passionately about any of them? She is rather docile and meek.When it comes to her feelings for Lloyd, that is where the passion should be apparent. Maybe she was intentionally underplaying it, but the first time she admits she loves Lloyd it is almost an aside, a throw-away line. And he calls her on it. Later, a montage of kissing scenes shows us that they are getting more involved. But do we ever see her proclaim her love the way Lloyd does with the boom box?

That is what Ridley Scott has gave and will give generations of future film-makers with his magnum opus, BLADE RUNNER. Credited personally by Ridley himself as the best film he ever did, I don't even know where to begin writing a review on this. The man just finished the behemoth that is Alien (1979), and proves he still had a lot more to offer the science fiction genre. Like Alejandero Jodorowsky before him, failure to get an adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune going, made him sign on to work on this masterpiece.If you haven't seen it, here's what your missing.

The story revolves around a cursed summer vacation spot, Camp Crystal Lake, and the slayings of young camp counselors. Critics slammed the film and I'm not sure why since it's in the same league as the acclaimed Carrie and Halloween. Regardless, it was hugely popular at the box office, making far more than any of the sequels until Freddy vs. Jason in 2003. As of this writing there are 12 movies in the franchise and another in the works, easily making it the most successful slasher series and one of the most successful franchises of any genre.I'm not a gorehound at all and only occasionally watch slasher flicks, but I'm a huge fan of the Friday the 13th franchise. Why? It has nothing to do with nostalgia since I didn't become a fan until I was well into adulthood when I saw 1985's Friday the 13th Part V A New Beginning on TV one night. I think I like these movies because they typically involve young adults in a fun camp-type environment in the woods, which naturally stirs fond youthful memories (not that I'm that old); the presence of a lunatic unstoppable killer -- who becomes more and more of a hideous monster -- just adds an air of danger and suspense to the dramedy and adventure. Add scores of gorgeous females and various filming locations around North America and you have a fabulously entertaining franchise that has yet to end.Speaking of the women, this first movie is highlighted by Annie (Robbi Morgan), Alice (Adrienne King) and Marcie (Jeannine Taylor) with honorable mention to Brenda and Claudette, the latter from the opening 1958 segment. As far as dudes go, a youthful Kevin Bacon is on hand as one of the counselors.As for the filming locations, this one was shot in Blairstown, NJ. It's interesting how none of the films were shot at the same location even though, typically, the location in the story is Camp Crystal Lake and that general vicinity. Other locations include Connecticut (II & IX), California (III, IV, V), Georgia (VI), Alabama (VII), British Columbia (VIII & XI), New York City (VIII), Toronto (X & XI) and Texas (XII).It's the camp-like settings of most of the franchise and the unstoppable monster that is Jason Voorhees that especially sets Friday the 13th apart from similar franchises.Concerning the tone, the first two films are serious in nature with the expected antics of youths on vacation in the woods, but the franchise introduced a campy element in Part III, which pretty much plagues the rest of the series until the reboot in 2009. Not that I'm complaining much, as these films are only quasi-believable anyway. Speaking of which, the only thing questionable about this first film&#x97;as far as realism goes&#x97; is how the killer is able to throw an adult corpse through a window or hang a body from a door, etc. But I suppose these things can be attributed to the powerfully psycho Voorhees gene.Many people find these films scary and shocking and the first two movies have some slightly chilling aspects, some of the others as well, I guess, but&#x97;with the exception of the 2009 reboot&#x97;I don't find these movies particularly scary. They're sometimes creepy, sometimes suspenseful, sometimes exciting and always fun & entertaining, but not scary (although there are numerous jump-scares, of course). In fact, I usually bust out laughing at the inevitable death scenes.I give Friday the 13th a high rating because it IS an effective film in the often-maligned slasher\/horror genre, not to mention it kicked-off this amazingly successful franchise.

There are no shortage of movies with a ton of action throughout the years(with The Raid Redemption films and The Expendables series as recent examples), but I digress, Hard Boiled is still in a class of its own. While Hard Boiled has some of the most intense, balls to the wall action scenes, high body counts, stunning action choreography(by Philip Kwok) and gigantic explosions. There is also excellent character development, intense melodrama and some of the best acting performances you will find in a movie with this amount of action in it. Chow Yun Fat is inspector Tequila, a serious tough cop and one man army who is working on a case involving gun running triad gangsters. Chow Yun Fat is very tough in this film.(like a Hong Kong Dirty Harry) Yun Fat is a very versatile and talented actor and brings a very naturalistic approach to his character, making his job look easy. Tony Leung, also a very talented and charismatic plays a deep undercover cop and one of the only actors in Hong Kong that can come close to matching Chow Yun Fat in both acting ability and screen presence. Both icons of Hong Kong cinema share great chemistry and work great together in this. Also from Hong Kong's A list of amazing actors and top stars is Anthony Wong as main villain, gun runner and all around amoral psychopath. Philip Kwok of Five Deadly Venoms fame is his sidekick Mad Dog, a loyal triad and hard as nails heavy with a code of honor. Philip is also action choreographer and stuntman as well. Philip Chan is Sup. Pang, Tequila's boss and former HK police officer for 15 years. Hard Boiled is the final collaboration between Chow Yun Fat and director John Woo. Woo is in top form here as director and collaborated well with his incredible cast. The dramatic scenes are as well done and interesting as the action. It is hard to pick a favorite John Woo film when you have A Better Tomorrow, Bullet In The Head, The Killer and this. Hard Boiled is every bit as good as the films I just mentioned, but kicked up a notch or two and it works. As Woo's swansong to the HK action film, he certainly went out with a bang before he made films in the US and returning to China with the awesome Chinese period epic Red Cliff.

This isn't because the film is particularly complicated, nor does it imply that there are loose ends to theorize about. It is simply because Gremlins can be interpreted in a number of different ways. Is it a dark family film? Or a cheesy horror flick? Is the film a clichéd product of the 80's? Or perhaps a smart satire that was years ahead of its time? For me, it is all of these things. It's a joyous romp that's hilariously silly - so much so that the absence of truly serious moments can be completely forgiven.The plot is simple; a young man receives a strange present from his dad a mysterious creature called a Gremlin! There are 3 rules that must be obeyed to insure that nothing goes wrong. One, the Gremlin must stay away from sunlight, or it will die. Two, the Gremlin must not get wet. And most importantly, the Gremlin must not be fed after midnight.Care to guess how many of these rules get broken before the film ends?Gremlins is a rare kind of a film, in that it has actually improved with age. The characters are laughably stupid, there's an abundance of product placement, and the Gremlins - even in their cute stage - are (perhaps) unintentionally creepy. These are legitimate problems, and yet, they actually manage to enhance the film. I think the over-the-top silliness of the film is to thank for this, as this allows for an environment in which unintentional laughter is not detrimental to the movie experience. This bizarre blend of self-aware comedy and unintentional humor has resulted in a film that will only continue to get better as the years pass. Admittedly, one could argue that Gremlins is a bit of an awkward film to watch, in that the the intentional and unintentional comedy is often indistinguishable from the other. One scene that effectively hones in on this issue is the famous monologue, in which one character recalls a tragic memory from her childhood. Supposedly, this scene caused a stir among studio executives, whom requested that the scene be removed as it was uncertain whether this was supposed to be sad or funny (if you care for my two cents, I laughed myself nearly to tears at this part).This could definitely be an issue for some. Is a film that contains so much unintentional humor and laughable flaws worthy of a recommendation? My answer is an unequivocal yes. The film thrives on clichés of the past. Now that what was modern in the 80's is also a tired cliché in the 21st century, Gremlins has become an intentional parody of itself. It's the tone that the film was always aiming for, and has managed to re-achieve that goal decades later.Another fascinating aspect of this film is the violence. Gremlins received a PG rating from the MPAA, and the criticism thrust at both this film, and the MPAA due to the violent images resulted in the birth of the PG-13 rating. Yes, as expected, Gremlins die (albeit, in highly creative and massively unexpected ways), but several humans perish as well. If one considers this film to be a horror movie, than this isn't unusual at all. But if one thinks of this as a family picture, than this is very unusual indeed. Once again, I reiterate this kind of movie simply demands discussion!The acting is terribly hammy, but in spite of - or rather, because of - this, the performances are delightful. Zach Gilligan is the lead actor, and Phoebe Cates portrays the love interest. Both characters are dull as dirt in terms of personality, but their moronic inclinations make them highly entertaining to watch all the same. The other actors tend to fall in the same territory.Jerry Goldsmith composed an appropriately maniacal score for this picture. It contains his signature synthesizers (adding to the film's dated feel even further), and ties in Christmas tunes to reflect the holiday setting. In terms of music, there are no questions here the tongue is absolutely in the cheek.There is roughly 45 minutes of build-up, followed by nearly an hour of Gremlins mayhem. Thanks to the camp nature of the film, the 45 minute build-up is no less entertaining than the Gremlin destruction later on. The last hour is almost non-stop craziness, and needless to say, it becomes exhausting. But it's the best kind of exhausting; the kind that comes with knowing that you're having an absolute blast. Indeed, the amount of fun here is almost overwhelming at times. It's tempting to spend the entire run-time of the movie trying to analyze its intentions, but the best route is to save this kind of thinking for afterwards. It honestly doesn't matter much in the long run whether you think Gremlins is a dumb movie for smart people, or a smart movie for dumb people.

It was a film meant to be enjoyed by people who had lived a little and understand what life is like. I'm also going to a 30th year high school reunion and will see a cross section of people from my youth who made difference choices throughout their lives.So this film is best enjoyed (and in a way, it is enjoyable) by those who have lived life and understand how painful it can be. There are two sets of protagonists The working class girls out on their own struggling to survive. Both are effectively homeless. One girl is basically crashing at a relative's apartment whose an accident victim. The other girl is there only because of a quick friendship. They are both living on borrowed time and need to find a place to live. Some of us have been there. I have. It was a brief period in my life that was not pleasant but helps me to appreciate what I have now.

The screenplay is written around one lame location, which just speaks volumes on how bereft of ideas and lazy this film is. Once Axel arrives at the theme park, we are introduced to evil security guards, who I hope get a bit more than minimum wage for their commitment to being extra evil - especially when they cause a ferris wheel to go out of control, which becomes a boring story detour for a few minutes to flatly film Murphy's stunt double jumping around the ferris wheel to save some kids. After years of misbehaving on film sets and staring in one bomb after another, Judge Reinhold left Hollywood with his tail between his legs, only to resurface in this stinker. After apologizing for his arrogance to the industry that spit him out, Judge seems like the only cast member excited to be in the film - and awake for that matter. The story plays out like a sitcom and even though there is profanity, this feels like kids stuff. If you catch this edited on network TV, you would mistake it for a family film.

To put it bluntly, The Last Picture Show is a cinematic, flawless masterpiece, steered by a ensemble of great actors, who come together like one big family as working so well off each other. Even a young Bridges, already showed so much great talent here, as a rebel town kid, Duane, best friends with Bottoms, who is a lighter natured boy. Duane is going out with the hottest girl in this small out of way Texas town (Shepherd) who's never looked hotter as the virginal sweetheart. Her timidity in the skinning dipping scene with a young randy, Randy Quaid, another acting asset as Lester, the town clown, is so cute. Set at the start of the good 'ol seventies, we follow the lives of these late teens, going through the normal changes in their life and passing into manhood, where they're a lot of moments we familiarize with reality. Times are getting tougher, the picture theatre closing down for one thing, where Duane ends going in the army, and an older Cloris Leachman becomes a sort of Mrs Robinson to a young Bottoms, after her husband Sam The Lion (Ben Johnson) passes, which I must say was a turning point. The last goodbye Duane and Sonny gave Sam, before heading down to Mexico before death took hold, made that memory more affecting Johnson's is the most memorable performance, an Oscar richly deserved, where Bridges was still getting started as an actor, as many others. Every actors great, every character leaving a visual impression on ya. The black and white choice for this film, couldn't of cut it more perfectly. The dry arid landscapes, the dusty shots of the town, the cold lake shots, are visually beautiful and memorable, reminding me of my own Northbound towns in the dry Summer heat. None was a more affecting moment than the hit and run of the young dumb sweeper kid, (Sam Bottoms). The friendship between Sonny and him, I really liked. In a mature screenplay, TLPS is just one of those unforgettable films, with unforgettable moments, some amusing, where really what I loved about it, was the characters, steered by such heavyweight performances, which was the real strength that drove this movie.

Robert Vaughn is a wonderful actor and his first scene in the film is one of the few genuinely funny ones but Ross Webster is a poor man's version of Lex Luthor.

On the one hand it virtually invented the maverick cop genre and we have it to thank for the slew of pale imitations which followed (notably the Lethal Weapon series) and parodies (such as the brilliant Slegehammer). Clint Eastwood is iconic and fantastic in the role, really the first cop who breaks the rules and enjoys it, the first movie cop to really carry a distinctive handgun (de riguer nowadays), Harry really is a force a nature, not so much a fascist as some would argue but a man who actually cares so much about society and the people that he's prepared to be ruthless to protect them. People see this as a right-wing film but it's not really, Scorpios victims include an Afro-American child and 2 young women, the police are able to save a flamboyantly gay man and a Catholic priest. It was always regarded as 'every frame votes for Nixon' but given his overwhelming election victory during the period it was certainly catching the mood of the times. When the girl gets kidnapped Harry immediately writes her off whilst the Mayor and the police Captain refuse to do so and want to pay the ransom and you're really not sure who's right or wrong? The DA and judge who let Scorpio go do so reluctantly but convincingly argue that we can't introduce evidence in court obtained by torture. Whilst the script ultimately sides with Harry's viewpoint it's not always so black and white as is often assumed.People argue this is a humourless film but I don't think so, the humour is just extremely dark and cutting. Harry just continually seems to be surrounded by people who just don't get him and his constant frustration is just hilarious and played to great comic effect. You do have to wonder if his nickname Dirty Harry is due purely to his methods? He always seems to be looking through naked girl's windows and following Scorpio into strip clubs?Terrific music although not as good as it will be in the arguably superior sequel Magnum Force. Wonderful performance from Andrew Robinson, the child of the free love 60s gone horribly wrong, so nice that Star Trek;DS9 will later give him a career resurgence. Apart from Harry and Scorpio the 2 characters that really stick in your mind are the superbly telegenic city of San Francisco itself and Harry's beloved 44 Magnum, not the most powerful handgun in the world and won't blow your head clean off (although I'd love to see Mythbusters try that)but still packs a hell of a punch. Michael Mann's Heat aside possibly the greatest cop movie ever.

Wonderful performance from Andrew Robinson, the child of the free love 60s gone horribly wrong, so nice that Star Trek;DS9 will later give him a career resurgence. Apart from Harry and Scorpio the 2 characters that really stick in your mind are the superbly telegenic city of San Francisco itself and Harry's beloved 44 Magnum, not the most powerful handgun in the world and won't blow your head clean off (although I'd love to see Mythbusters try that)but still packs a hell of a punch. Michael Mann's Heat aside possibly the greatest cop movie ever.

On the one hand it virtually invented the maverick cop genre and we have it to thank for the slew of pale imitations which followed (notably the Lethal Weapon series) and parodies (such as the brilliant Slegehammer). Clint Eastwood is iconic and fantastic in the role, really the first cop who breaks the rules and enjoys it, the first movie cop to really carry a distinctive handgun (de riguer nowadays), Harry really is a force a nature, not so much a fascist as some would argue but a man who actually cares so much about society and the people that he's prepared to be ruthless to protect them. People see this as a right-wing film but it's not really, Scorpios victims include an Afro-American child and 2 young women, the police are able to save a flamboyantly gay man and a Catholic priest. It was always regarded as 'every frame votes for Nixon' but given his overwhelming election victory during the period it was certainly catching the mood of the times. When the girl gets kidnapped Harry immediately writes her off whilst the Mayor and the police Captain refuse to do so and want to pay the ransom and you're really not sure who's right or wrong? The DA and judge who let Scorpio go do so reluctantly but convincingly argue that we can't introduce evidence in court obtained by torture. Whilst the script ultimately sides with Harry's viewpoint it's not always so black and white as is often assumed.People argue this is a humourless film but I don't think so, the humour is just extremely dark and cutting. Harry just continually seems to be surrounded by people who just don't get him and his constant frustration is just hilarious and played to great comic effect.
