Its amalgamating of inner-city grit which comes complete with hearty, tough minded souls looking to intimidate and endorse masculinity is mixed up with a buddy genre comedic slant that comes in addition to a romance plot-line as well as particular undercurrents of race relations drama. The conventions and content happen to blend and mesh together with one another rather well, all of it formulating together on their own levels to create a decent piece. Additionally rife with elements of queer theory, the film is principally one of which a relationship must exist between two characters which will then go on to be vital for both its and their successes, and although on face value this is one of a heterosexual ilk that might exist between one of the leads and his New Yorker girlfriend, it is actually one of which exists between the two leads, of whom are both male. It's in this sense that the film is ultimately about the rivalry and potential for danger which exists between two men; the understanding which the pair of them undergo of this that exists between, as well as the acceptance of one another which their misadventures and particular relationship drags them toward.Like varying recent films of a similar ilk, ranging from Tony Scott's 1986 film Top Gun to Zack Snyder's highly stylised, 2007 postmodern war film 300; White Men Can't Jump is about the bonding men undergo and the manly activities in which they partake in the apparent hope at forging masculine identities. The two men in question are Woody Harrleson's Billy Hoyle and Wesley Snipes' Sidney Deane; two fairly young and wholly fit males whom enjoy the sport of basketball so much so that it will come to act as the manly catalyst for each of their respective on-screen plights, just as engaging as a fighter pilot did for the leads in Top Gun and engaging in warfare did for the scantily-clad warriors of 300. Featured in all three examples are loose sub-plots to do with the supposed connection to that of a female character whom only feels predominant, and is often sidelined for the ties the men have with one another which are able to push through. Here, the most interesting material to do with relationships features its two leads; the case-in-point being that by the time the film has veered somewhat off piste and into a sequence encompassing a TV game show which serves only to endorse the film's lone heterosexual relationship, we are not as interested nor engaged as we were when its two male leads were on screen clashing with one another, on one occasion bickering during a match like an elderly couple.Hoyle and Deane live locally and maintain relationships with their female partners which come complete with mites of discontent, although Hoyle is additionally in trouble with some gangsters to whom he owes a fair amount of money and believes himself to have escaped to here Los Angeles' Venice district. Their first encountering of one another is indeed on the highly masculine and ego-centric basketball courts of Los Angeles' Venice Beach, as sinking shots from the dusty tarmac for large sums of money before gloating is the order of the day. Where Sidney appears loud mouthed and full of himself, Billy is more reserved and restrained; his victimisation at the hands of Deane and his companions sees them drag class as well as race into the situation when Hoyle, being white, has a country club tag attributed to him and deemed unworthy within the sport's field. Hoyle promptly beats Deane and his crew, with the minimum of fuss and we are able to visibly see Deane's slight wilting under the pressure as he becomes the victim to his own manliness.As Hoyle leaves the courts, his worn and sweaty figure is captured post-workout by Deane's gaze he is wholly impressed by the man's abilities; so much so that following him home and coming in to exclaim his true feelings occurs. Away from the courts, Hoyle's girlfriend Gloria (Perez) is a hardened academic, buried in encyclopedias and academia in an apartment which has been decorated by pictures of famous people. She comes across as being on another level to him, both literally or spiritually in this sense as well as academically; their only true link to one another that of a healthy sex life, since Hoyle is unable to truly engage in her brainier characteristics bar offer her the odd compliment to do with his belief she'd be able to win a TV game show. Hoyle's eventual tryst with Deane will see them both occupy a realm upon which basketball acts as the all-linking catalyst which sees them click, and this is easier and more familiar for him than that of his girlfriend's demands. Crucially, White Men Can't Jump goes on to document the failing of a bond with a woman that one of the main characters has; a telling sequence nearer the end encompassing the pair of protagonists practically walking hand in hand being symptomatic with the newfound homoerotic understanding.Director Ron Shelton has an eye for the on screen basketball, of which he has of sorts rendered a ballet in that there are degrees of dance or presentation behind the characters' lyrical boasting and verbal jousting before the physical stepping up to play the sport finishes the performance off. There is enough to get involved in, overall; the looming sharks provide ample threat for Hoyle as Deane attempts to get on with his real estate career and finding a proper home for his family. The film is a mixed bag of sports movie clichés; interesting insights into the lives and minds of basketball hustlers and droll formula linked to past-tragedies; epiphanies and moral choices but it all hangs together and works on the whole.
