In order to distract the voting public from the Presidential scandal, Washington spin doctor Conrad Brean (Robert De Niro) hires Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman) to orchestrate a fake war against Albania. Barry Levinson's 'Wag the Dog' is a biting political satire, and a well-humoured exploration of the manipulation of the mass media and public opinion in American politics. The screenplay was based loosely upon Larry Beinhart's satirical conspiracy theory novel, 'American Hero,' which asserted that President George H. W. Bush had completely concocted the Gulf War. David Mamet was originally claimed to be the sole adapting screenwriter, but Hilary Henkin took the film's producers to court, claiming otherwise. Ultimately, Henkin was awarded the top writing credit, and the two shared an Oscar nomination in 1998.Just a month after the film was released, 'Wag the Dog' received a massive boost of public interest thanks to a startling coincidence. In January of 1998, much like the Presidential character in the film, President Bill Clinton became involved in a disastrous sex scandal arising from his former relationship with 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Over the course of 1998 and 1999, the United States engaged in three military ventures Operation Desert Fox, Operation Infinite Reach and Operation Allied Force, each during pivotal moments throughout the scandal. The events truly are an eerie example of real life echoing fiction &#150; but, then again, perhaps Clinton's advisers had just sat down for a screening of the film!The very idea of creating a convincing fake war is absolutely ridiculous, but somehow a great cast makes it seem almost believable, with De Niro once again proving his comedic talent as the no-nonsense, never-say-die Presidential schemist (a good plan today is better than a perfect plan tomorrow) and Hoffman terrific as the rich, enthusiastic and credit-starved film producer (did you know there's no Academy Award for producing?). Hoffman would have been glad that, despite not being nominated for a nonexistent producer's Oscar, he did pick up a Best Actor in a Leading Role nomination for his excellent work here.Perhaps it is because the film is based on a singular implausible premise, but the film failed to entirely hold steam throughout its running time, never really managing to keep pace with the hilarity of the opening minutes, when De Niro and Hoffman's plan first begins to fall into place. The film finishes on a rather uncharacteristic downbeat note, perhaps Levinson's means of bringing the audience back into the callous world of political deception and corruption. After all, whilst everybody involved appeared to have a grand time orchestrating a fictional war against the unfortunate nation of Albania, none of it is really a laughing matter at all.

There was nothing, I repeat, nothing of value with this film that tried to blend the teary eye of Costner with that of The Sixth Sense. First time drama director Shadyac (who would be better known as the founder of Ace Ventura), cannot seem to grasp this film as he continually combines cliché elements from other films, random occurrences that never quite link us to the ending, and a complete waste of actual talent. He has the blocks to build the story, but instead he just tosses them into a waterfall hoping that they will land upright. Was this a supernatural thriller, was it a romantic drama, or was it just another venue for Kevin Costner to attempt to apply his leading man status to? For me, I couldn't quite see where Shadyac was going or what genre he was interacting with. The trouble begins with the story, of which couples with soul-mates, dragonflies, and coming back from the dead, as well as what a popular majority thinks. Listening to the commentary, Shadyac explains that his cut of the film wasn't as received as the final cut because too many people knew the ending prior to it happening. In my eyes &#150; that is worthwhile if the story continues to attract us &#150; but in Dragonfly that is not the case. The story is trite and quite dull, leading to an ending that surprises mainly because you don't care any further. Joe Darrow lost his wife, cannot cope even months later, and begins to think that she is contacting him from the dead &#150; but for what reason? If you weren't pulled in by my synopsis, then I do not suggest viewing this film because in 22 words, I have probably told you everything.The acting is atrocious, possibly the worst roles created for two very talented actors. I am speaking of both Costner and that unknown talent that normally reverberates from Kathy Bates, but seemed to be missing this time. Perhaps it is the tone, the vague symbolism, or just the fact that these two needed paychecks that soured this film, but instances were not connecting. By the big surprise at the end, we are either so tired of the events or have (in my case) forgotten them, that there is no gasp or shock, merely just excitement to have a finale to this horrid broadcast. Shadyac has talent as a director, I even find myself laughing at Bruce Almighty, but drama is not his cup of tea. This film was too dark without any signs of light, which can be a good thing for skilled directors, but not for first-time Shadyac. He needed a blend of comic with the eerie unknown, which would have offset the disaster this train was headed towards. Costner couldn't carry Shadyac's work, and became murky and muddled through the middle. He had no central focus, so we - as audience members &#150; didn't know who he was. Was he crazy or just in love? How come we never saw his love for his wife? Unanswered questions that Shadyac and Costner never allowed anyone to answer.To add to my disgust was the filming overall of this movie. Just as I was confused as to the real ending to the film, I am sure that those involved were equally as confused. We move, rather quickly, from children seeing the dead, to dragonflies, to white water rafting, all the way back to some native tribe in South America. It just seemed like we were jumping rather quickly, but in the wrong direction. Without giving it away, I had forgotten the main element to the ending when we got to it because we were muddled with so many other un-needed moments that the ending just seemed watered down and dull. Honestly, I was bored with this movie because it lead us down one path, somehow jumped to another, and tried to make it back to that original path that was already lost and forgotten. The music didn't match with the actions or emotions of the characters, the hints were hidden and expected, there was no moment of self-discovery. There wasn't a scene in the film where I suddenly went, oh, I get it -- and that is sad. Dragonfly had the potential, I just felt that Shadyac was behind the wheel of a vehicle that he couldn't control, and as you listen to the commentary, you can sense (and at times hear) that he didn't want to be behind the wheel at all.Dragonfly is a pointless corporate film driven to bring in more money while capitalizing on the income produced by The Sixth Sense. There are borrowed elements that Shadyac cannot control as well as actors that walk through their scenes wondering when the paycheck will arrive at their doorstep. This is the worst film to see Kathy Bates perform, and Costner continues to dig himself a bigger hole. As you listen to the commentary, this film underwent quite a bit of changes due to viewer issues and response, which I think is the worst way to edit a film. Shadyac has no problems saying that he edited this wrong, and that he didn't like x scene, and that he felt this was completely amateurish &#150; which only helps solidify a inner feeling of disappointment with the film. He selflessly promotes Bruce Almighty during this film, which drove the nail further into the already built Dragonfly coffin. I do not suggest this film to anyone unless you like your water from the tap, meaning that if you don't mind drinking muddled, tainted, and possibly poisoned liquid &#150; than Dragonfly will be the film for you.

Some people, however, claim that it is primarily education, something that does not become a lecture in itself but something that uplifts us, makes us better people, leads us to reflections on who we are, what our roles as humans are. And one of such films that, to the very core, addresses these horizons is BRAVEHEART, directed by Mel Gibson...perhaps not that popular name among many noble men of modern times, yet someone who truly has something to offer to open minded viewers and to modern cinema. I loved this movie when I saw it for the first time and have admired it each time I have seen it since then. Why? BRAVEHEART is, first of all, an amazing story of COURAGE and fight for FREEDOM What can be more moving, more appealing than this? Set in the Middle Ages, the character of Scotsman William Wallace may be interpreted at two different levels he is a historic figure, on the one hand, who does not only talk about goodness for his nation but really fights for it to the last breath - he is a real hero in the historical meaning of this word; on the other hand, however, he is a universal representation of all men of courage, of all who dared say no to the tyranny, slavery, any sorts of humiliations, dignity deprivation, and, what is more... of all men who have been able to love someone else in truthfulness. Anyone who is straightforward may identify with Wallace, may say Yeah, that is what I also feel nowadays... Therefore, the content of BRAVEHEART is very touching, very up to date and makes it a real tribute to three major treasures of humanity Love, Courage and Freedom. Yet, it appears that Freedom is step no. 1 among these three since a free heart opens the door for the rest. ...just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take... OUR FREEDOM. Freedom' is the word that Wallace shouts out desperately not only before battle of Stirling but just before his death - an undeniably powerful moment that you will never forget. BRAVEHEART is a real masterwork of epic productions This aspect concerns both visual effectiveness, including battle scenes, locations, cinematography, historical accuracy, and performances. The movie is filled with such profoundly subtle pictures that they are impossible not to leave any trace in the viewer. Battles (Stirling and Falkirk) are realistic, very brutal but this brutality emphasizes psychology of wicked enemy. It is not brutality just for its sake. Gentle scenes of peaceful locations go in pairs with affections to the nation, they make us realize why Wallace fights so indefatigably. The opening sequence is a must see in this aspect. Moreover, costumes and all historical factors make BRAVEHEART a fabulous epic, one of the best in its genre. However, it would be nothing without performances and there is really much to praise here. Gibson reaches the impossible giving a truly charismatic performance in the lead. Consider, for instance, his face expressions throughout the film. Really an Oscar worthy acting! Analysing other Scotsmen's roles first, I loved Brendan Gleeson as characteristic Hamish Campbell and Catherine McCormack as gentle dreamlike Murron.

Some people, however, claim that it is primarily education, something that does not become a lecture in itself but something that uplifts us, makes us better people, leads us to reflections on who we are, what our roles as humans are. And one of such films that, to the very core, addresses these horizons is BRAVEHEART, directed by Mel Gibson...perhaps not that popular name among many noble men of modern times, yet someone who truly has something to offer to open minded viewers and to modern cinema. I loved this movie when I saw it for the first time and have admired it each time I have seen it since then. Why? BRAVEHEART is, first of all, an amazing story of COURAGE and fight for FREEDOM What can be more moving, more appealing than this? Set in the Middle Ages, the character of Scotsman William Wallace may be interpreted at two different levels he is a historic figure, on the one hand, who does not only talk about goodness for his nation but really fights for it to the last breath - he is a real hero in the historical meaning of this word; on the other hand, however, he is a universal representation of all men of courage, of all who dared say no to the tyranny, slavery, any sorts of humiliations, dignity deprivation, and, what is more... of all men who have been able to love someone else in truthfulness. Anyone who is straightforward may identify with Wallace, may say Yeah, that is what I also feel nowadays... Therefore, the content of BRAVEHEART is very touching, very up to date and makes it a real tribute to three major treasures of humanity Love, Courage and Freedom. Yet, it appears that Freedom is step no. 1 among these three since a free heart opens the door for the rest. ...just one chance, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives, but they'll never take... OUR FREEDOM. Freedom' is the word that Wallace shouts out desperately not only before battle of Stirling but just before his death - an undeniably powerful moment that you will never forget. BRAVEHEART is a real masterwork of epic productions This aspect concerns both visual effectiveness, including battle scenes, locations, cinematography, historical accuracy, and performances. The movie is filled with such profoundly subtle pictures that they are impossible not to leave any trace in the viewer. Battles (Stirling and Falkirk) are realistic, very brutal but this brutality emphasizes psychology of wicked enemy. It is not brutality just for its sake. Gentle scenes of peaceful locations go in pairs with affections to the nation, they make us realize why Wallace fights so indefatigably. The opening sequence is a must see in this aspect. Moreover, costumes and all historical factors make BRAVEHEART a fabulous epic, one of the best in its genre. However, it would be nothing without performances and there is really much to praise here. Gibson reaches the impossible giving a truly charismatic performance in the lead. Consider, for instance, his face expressions throughout the film. Really an Oscar worthy acting! Analysing other Scotsmen's roles first, I loved Brendan Gleeson as characteristic Hamish Campbell and Catherine McCormack as gentle dreamlike Murron.

Jaws is not simply a monster movie, it goes right in to the heart of an island community Amity Island, which is terrorised by a man -eating shark which staked its claim in the friendly waters of a New England island community. The rich characterisation of every character is sublime. The suspense is unbelievable, and the sense of fear adventure and wonderment of the open water is also evident in this film. This film made me terrified of Sharks, and the water since i was a child- thats a mark of a great movie right there. The editing in JAWS was Oscar winning, and deservedly so- it had masterful cinematography, and the score from Williams is probably his greatest even above Indiana Jones and Star Wars, and the score to Jaws the 'bah-bum-bah-bum' is possibly the most famous piece of music you will ever hear in a motion picture. All this combine to make this if not the greatest film of all time- pretty darn close to it, due to every individual element of film-making at its very best throughout this picture. The opening attack, is the most shocking beginning to a movie your likely to see...with the highly documented problems in production with the mechanical shark undoubtedly makes this film so special as Spielberg got to do what he does best. Create suspense without actually seeing the perpetrator. Think about the T-Rex in Jurassic Park we knew his arrival with the thud and the vibrations in the mud or a glass of water for instance. Spielberg does similar here, we know the shark is there with the use of an underwater camera taking the sharks POV and John Williams famous music. IN this opening scene the vulnerable girl is killed dramatically from something from below...the camera work follows her legs from the depths as the camera takes the Sharks POV and the music begins, and the camera gets closer and closer then the attack...a masterful piece of suspense film-making. The rubber shark itself isn't terrifying, but the seamless editing and Spielbergs masterful direction makes it so. One scene which deserves an in-depth look is the scene where the young boy on the raft is killed. What is great about this scene and what makes Spielberg truly great and at his height of his suspense craft is how he set up this scene. The premise is the chief Brody paranoid of another attack so he sits in his beach chair focusing obsessively on the water; the camera is focused entirely on him, as people walk past him and talk to him either off frame or in the shot, meanwhile Brody is entirely still focused on the water; Spielberg further sets various scents- the dog playing fetch; and the shrill screams in the water which we think is the shark but is a couple playing...so Spielberg throws us off the idea of an attack especially when a young boy enters the water on a raft, its basically a rule that young people don't get murdered in Hollywood movies right? No character is safe in this movie, which makes it all the more scary. Suddenly Spielberg puts us right on the scent as the dog owner can't find his dog suddenly...could it be? then the camera does does the under water cam and suddenly we realise its the shark- as it attacks the boy on the raft. What is genius is the camera pans at speed to Brody's sensitised reaction of panic, as the whole beach is in chaos. That was just one scene of many on how Spielberg sets a scene as well as any director alive. As mentioned earlier the characterisation in this movie is wonderful, whether it be the main guys or the co-actors every body has their own distinct personality which makes this movie special. Even in little moments of humour, or fear we get distinctly involved in the characters and the impact this shark has on the peoples lives. After we see the effects the Shark is having on the community 3 men the dangerously un-hinged fisherman Quint (Shaw), Dr.Hooper the rich Shark expert (Dreyfuss-probably his greatest role) and the main character, everyman chief of police Brody terrifically played by Scheider. They set off on a tiny boat on to the open seas to face this Shark once and for all...this is where the adventure element comes in and where the film truly becomes elite. The actors clearly work off each other in the intimate scenes, especially in the dinner scene where they compare injuries and Quint does the amazing story of the USS Indianapolis. Key to his characterisation. Also The music when the boat chases the shark with the barrels on him, is filled with exciting swash buckling adventure, as i said before this film has everything. Suspense, adventure,humour in the flaws of the characters- everything. Its as close to a perfectly put together movie you will likely see. The ending is rousing and exciting as Bordy conquers his fear of the water and faces down the on coming shark, as his boat is barely above water, he's alone with one bullet left to hit the tank he stuffed int he sharks mouth....Smile you son of a B.... BOOM!!! This movie is the granddaddy of all suspense movies, and we can see Spielberg at his finest and craftyness creating suspense out of nowhere. You know when you've finished Jaws- you have witnessed as close to a perfect film as humanly possible, an absolute joy and terrifying to watch even 32 years later.

Maybe you forget a pencil for school, a binder for work, or your car keys when you walk to your car. What if that happened everyday? What if you could never remember anything new? What if you could never remember anything after a certain point in your life? This is how Leonard Shelby feels.Memento tells the story of Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), who was faced with a terrible incident a a few years back which resulted in his wife's death and his ability to make new, recent memories completely demolished. He does not know for how long, but Leonard has been looking for his wife's killer, a man that he has only seen with a mask over his face. Leonard doesn't know if he has ever killed the man already or he is still looking for him since he can't remember anything new for more than 5 minutes.To make sure he remembers new, important info, Leonard gets many tattoos all over his body. He believes that writing notes when he has such a severe condition like this would make him very confused, therefore, tattoos make more sense since he sees them everyday. Some of these tattoos say, John G did it or Your wife is dead. All of this, just to remember what he has to do daily.The sad part is, Leonard might find this killer. He might have known him forever. But if he ever comes face to face with him, before having seen his tattoos, he won't know what to do since he doesn't know why he is looking or what happened to his wife.Memento has a very disturbing element to it that is very creative on the Nolan brothers' part. Collaborative writing has never worked out so good and single credit directing...they might be the next Coen brothers.At this point, the Nolan's had only mad one film prior, 1998's Following and have since this made Insomnia, Batman Begins, and The Prestige, all great, full-of-twists thrillers.Their best film definitely is Memento with it's edge of your seat thrills, camera angles, and great acting. The best part of the film is that it's told in reverse and forwards so you get a sense of what Leonard goes through since you have to remember what happened before and why it connects to what's happening now.Guy Pearce, Carrie-Ann Moss, and Joe Pantaliano could not have been more perfectly cast as the title characters. Guy Pearce as Leonard, the star, Carrie-Ann Moss, as Natalie, a woman who helps Leonard with his problem since she, like him, has also lost someone close to her. And Joe Pantaliano stars as Teddy, whose identity never seems to be certain throughout the film.Memento is a definite must-see. It has no flaws whatsoever and should be viewed before anyone's death. It is one of my personal favorite movies and I have yet to meet anyone who hates this film. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.

Fire Walk with Me pretty much requires the viewer to have already seen every episode of the television show. If you haven't you will be well and truly lost as you watch this film unfold in the bizarre Twin Peaks universe. Assuming you have the requisite working knowledge of all things Twin Peaks heading in you'll at least be able to understand the film. Whether you'll like the film is an iffy proposition at best.Fire Walk with Me is a prequel to the television series which means Laura Palmer is alive. But before we can get to Laura there's a thirty-minute or so prologue (a prequel within a prequel?) about the investigation into the murder of Teresa Banks, whom all the Twin Peaks die-hards know was the first victim of the killer who would eventually murder Laura. After what any fan of the television show will see as some typical weirdness, and not much in the way of resolution, the prologue ends and we move forward in time, jumping into the final week of Laura Palmer's life. It's nice to see Laura alive for the first time. The television show had already established Laura was not the sweet, innocent homecoming queen she seemed but her demons were, for the most part, only hinted at on TV. In Fire Walk with Me those demons are on full display. Where the television show was subtle, the movie is in your face. A little too much in your face some might say as David Lynch takes full advantage of all the opportunities provided by producing an R-rated movie. Certainly nothing is held back here as we watch Laura Palmer spiral downward towards her sad end.In the rather brutal telling of the story of Laura Palmer's final days all the charm of the television series has been lost. For all the terrible things that occurred in the series the show always had that small-town, quirky charm. Not here. For the Twin Peaks fan it's nice to see those familiar characters again. And the film does add a lot to the Laura Palmer story and allows you to get to know her much better. But you may come away wishing you hadn't gotten to know her quite so well. Perhaps some things are better left unspoken and unseen. There were two sides of Laura Palmer and this film shows you much too much of the dark side. There was a lot of good in her, watching this film makes it hard to remember that even as you can't help but sympathize with the way she is being taken advantage of and the way she will meet her ultimate fate.If you're a real Twin Peaks fan you really do have to see the movie. There is a lot to like about it. The story is captivating as ever, if decidedly less charming in this go-around. And the performances from the cast are mostly very good, most notably from Sheryl Lee who finally gets to play a living, breathing Laura Palmer after having been introduced to the world dead and wrapped in plastic. And Ray Wise as Laura's father Leland also does fine work in portraying a disturbing and complicated character. We never got to see Leland and Laura interact in the series and their relationship is fascinating to watch. Fascinating and also more than a little creepy as the movie's Leland is a constantly ominous, threatening presence. You'll miss Lara Flynn Boyle who for the film has been replaced in the role of Donna by Moira Kelly. Kelly fails to bring the same spark to the character that Boyle did. And while many of the characters from the show return you'll miss those who notably don't. Audrey and Benjamin Horne, Sheriff Truman, Deputies Andy and Hawk, Doc Hayward and Pete Martell and Big Ed...would have been nice to see them and some others one last time if even just briefly. It is nice to have the opportunity to go back to the Twin Peaks universe. Unfortunately it's not quite the universe you remember.

Filmed in 1953 before the explosion of colour movies Hitch commenced from 1954 - 1959 Rear Window - to North by North-West (bar The Wrong Man which shrewdly and aptly used B & W to authenticate its documentary approach), it can seem stolid and dated. The religious symbolism is perhaps overplayed at times and one has to suspend belief at the massive coincidences which Hitch asks us to swallow (Keller kills Villette at exactly the time that Clift and Baxter's characters want him out of the way to stop his blackmailing) but there are some typical flourishes by the Master - particularly Baxter's slow motion descent to meet Clift in her flashback recollection and the half face close up of Karl Malden, here patrolling the Streets of Quebec as an inquisitive police detective, as he catches sight of Clift and Baxter meeting outside the murder scene.

It's as simple as that.Basically, this story is nothing but one man's diatribe against faith, and why the man lost it. He lost it - get this - because God didn't audibly answer his prayers. Since he didn't hear a booming voice from a burning bush answering his prayers then, he surmises, there must be no God. Unbelievable. Anyway, all of this sounds good to atheist\/agnostic film critics. However, I believe Bergman might have been more of a believer than he let on because God was a topic in a number of his films. At least, he was wrestling about His existence, and that's not unusual. Too bad that in none of his films does he come up with a pro-God answer.Even if all the religious talks means nothing to you, I think most people would find this film way too boring so the entertainment value is not going to be there.

If it looks strange that Pierce Brosnan plays a non-James Bond spy, don't let that turn you off; as it is, I like this spy better than his role as James Bond.The plot has British agent Andrew Osnard (Brosnan) getting involved with impeccably dressed tailor Harry Pendel (Geoffrey Rush) in Panama City.

The potentially explosive political climate surrounding them serves to heighten the tension.I certainly thought that Brosnan and Rush both did a really good job with their roles. Jamie Lee Curtis is actually, in my opinion, a strange person to cast in a spy movie - I've always found it a little bit hard to view her in a tense role - though I do feel that she did a good job with the role. And playing the son is none other than Harry Potter himself, Daniel Radcliffe.So, while it may not be the most eye-opening spy movie ever, it creates a fairly unnerving feeling.

After a stagehand is killed with a pickax, the director quietly decides to continue his stage production out of desperation for his sagging career and a good payday. He informs actress Corinne(Loredana Parrella)to lock the exit\/entrance door and hide the key. Of course, she's the next female victim to be killed, viciously stabbed by Wallace, who hides under the hawk head of actor Brett(Giovanni Lombardo Radice, really playing his prototypical homosexual prankster to the hilt in scene-stealing fashion). So the crew who decided to stay on and continue the play are trapped in the building! If that isn't inspired, I don't know what is. The rest of the film has the crew trying to stay close together and alive as Wallace roams the building with various weapons he confiscated from a workshop(including a drill which penetrates the stomach of one victim, a chainsaw which cuts one fellow's arm clean off and cuts two more poor helpless souls in half, and stabs another quite viciously with a blade). The female protagonist is Alicia(Barbara Cupisti), an actress fired from the leading role when she escaped from the building for a while to get her bruised ankle looked at(coincidently by a doctor at the psychiatric hospital;Wallace hid in the backseat of Alicia and her stagehand friend's car). They do remember a skeleton key being placed in an office desk drawer which might be their only means out of the building. Soon, the killer will have it and Alicia will have to use her brains to get out of the building or else.Director Soavi himself plays one of the cops stationed outside the building in the car supposedly to guard them from further harm..he has a novel with the photo of James Dean printed on it wondering to his partner if he resembles the Hollywood legend.Not exactly original, but a pulse-pounding gore-thriller nonetheless. Soavi was establishing himself here staying close to the genre of his predecessors. He'd later make his own path with Dellamorte Dellamore. Stagefright is very stylish with a rather silly ending that just won't quit.

But while that sort of joke can be funny in its silliness, it wears thin; even more so if you're hungry for something special.DEAD MEN is a one-joke film, but it is an exquisite joke. Steve Martin plays Rigby Reardon, the sort of 40s hard-boiled movie detective who is prone to dry, sardonic voiceovers. Model turned actress-of-the-moment, Rachel Ward, plays the ritzy dame who brings him a case that is so convoluted that it isn't worth explaining. But as Rigby investigates he comes in contact with a variety of suspects, witnesses and miscellaneous secondary characters, mostly portrayed by film stars of the past (Cary Grant, Barbara Stanwyck, Ingrid Bergman, Burt Lancaster, etc.), who appear via film clips from their old movies (SUSPICION; SORRY, WRONG NUMBER; NOTORIOUS; THE KILLERS; etc.). Through editing tricks and special effects, Martin and the old timers share the screen for a few minutes, exchanging inane dialogue. It's a great gimmick and on first and second viewing the slickly done cinema tricks carry the film. How the jokes are told is funny, even if the jokes themselves aren't.Unfortunately, this type of shtick wears out its welcome sooner or later. The film is extremely well made -- the blending of the celebrity cameos with the new footage is barely detectable and the filmmakers even enlisted the aid of dress designer Edith Head and composer Miklós Rózsa, both working on their last film, to augment and complement their contributions to their previous films. Obviously, everyone worked very hard to make the film as visually true as possible to the films that inspired it. But the hot dog at this gourmet restaurant is the lame script by Martin, George Gipe and director Carl Reiner. I guess what they were going for was a MAD Magazine type of satire that knowingly mocks the genre with self-satire. And like YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, as long as it stays close to its original template, the movie is pretty good.But there is too much wild and crazy guy influence in the film. Instead of letting Martin play a funny character in a reasonable facsimile of a film noir, albeit a goofy parody, the film tries to build the story around contemporary low brow humor. The film has too many breast fondling jokes, profane words, references to dog poop and such, each a cheap gag that conflicts with the serious -- but easily mocked -- spirit of tough guy film noir. Too often the film sells out to bad taste, often at the expense of the film's guest stars. Also, there is no sense of reverence for the legendary stars; for instance, Humphrey Bogart, the man who defined the genre, appears via several of his old movies, as basically Reardon's flunky. In most cases, the old stars are just used as straight men for Martin's jokes -- their old movie dialogue being a set up for Martin's awkward punchlines. As such, they are often also the butt of the jokes; and though I am sure it wasn't the filmmakers' intent, it is condescending how the stars are used as unwitting pawns of the humor.Tone and intent aside, the film also suffers from having been constructed in the wrong way. The filmmakers watched the old movies, looking for scenes that would be easy to recycle (a lot of close ups and over the shoulder shots, etc.), and then they built their story around that material. As a result, the story doesn't make much sense. For instance, a subplot involves Rigby going psychotic whenever he hears the phrase cleaning woman, but it is in the film because in her cameo, Bette Davis mentions her cleaning woman. So the joke is forced and just stupid. No doubt, it would have been much harder, but the results would have been profoundly more rewarding, if they had written a solid screenplay and then found clips that would fit.DEAD MEN DON'T WEAR PLAID just begs to be remade, so that it could take advantage of the advances in CGI technology. If it could be Forrest Gump-ed, the interaction between the old and new footage could be more inventive and new dialogue that actually advanced the story could be written and delivered by manipulating the sound and image of the old stars. Of course, that might be ethically dubious and maybe even sacrilege, but if it were a sincere homage, that would beat this clumsy burlesque any day.
