Among a smorgasbord of quality A-list actors, Billy Bob Thornton's performance stands out, as it is a triumph not only of acting, but one where the collaborative efforts of writing, costuming, and makeup came together with precision. As for Jennifer Lopez, I haven't seen many of her movies, but I have a hunch that she gave more to this one than any other. And, Sean Penn as usual knocks his role out of the park.The camera may occasionally move a little too much for its own good, and the Russian mafia subplot seems to be a little under-developed, but even with these minor smudges, I'd say Oliver Stone's least overtly political movie is up there in quality with the best of the year, and may just be the most inspired work he's ever done.It reminds me of David Lynch's Lost Highway (1997) and Wild at Heart (1990), because of its nightmarish rapid-fire editing techniques, its violence, and its desert motifs. Alex de la Iglesia's Perdita Durango (1997) also comes to mind. Its twisty plot reminded me of the Coen Brothers at their best, because like with their best, I was also wishing Stone's ride would never end. It's like a bloodier, sexier The Big Lebowski (1998). And even though it may be less goofy, it still elicits some pretty choice laughs.

It is a dreadfully boring movie with literally no redeeming qualities. Only serious fans of the series should ever consider watching. In the US, it is available on VHS, and several DVD editions.Back in 1998, Gus Van Sant directed a shot-for-shot remake of Psycho. He used the same camera angles, screenplay, and score. The movie was unsuccessful on all accounts but provided a wonderful example of why most remakes fail. A film's effectiveness is in the hand of its director and the affectation of its actors. You can't simply copy what someone else has made and expect the final product to be the same. A successful remake has to maintain the original film's plot points and message (assuming one exists) and demonstrate the new director's sensibilities.With The Howling IV The Original Nightmare, I've discovered a complimentary example to accompany Van Sant's Psycho experiment. This is a direct-to-video remake of the first Howling film, though it is labeled as an additional adaptation of Gary Brandner's first Howling novel. A lot of the unnecessary details from the book, which were left out of the first movie, are inserted into this one. The droll, clichéd horror film setting of a cabin in the woods and demented, frustrated lesbian nun character (both part of the novel) had no business being in this movie. This is a much worse version of what was already a sub-par film.The opening credits are performed by some pop band that tells us something evil, woo-oh is going to happen. There are many perfunctory uses of music in this series, but this has to be the worse example in any of the seven films. It's an open admittance that this film is going to be beyond terrible. It will enter the realm of skip it bad movies that occupy the dustiest corners of pawn shops. After that amusing sequence, we see a couple traveling to the county side to get away from the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles.The husband character travels through the weird Hammeresque fog that is always present (even in day) to the town and begins having an affair with a seductive shopkeeper. The town looks like it was constructed by a group of film students making a cheesy Western. You can see the painted-on building names if you look closely. The only good looking buildings are peppered with blatant Coca-Cola advertising. Sometimes the camera stops on a sign reading Coke for an entire shot. The wife claims to here wolf cries at night that sound a lot like generic thunderbolt sound clips. She even has visions of ghosts who lived in the cabin a while ago. These are very poorly realized ghost effects, as in they aren't special at all. People pop up, knock over some furniture and are edited out. We see dead people come in and out of this movie all the time.The man's affair leads to him becoming a werewolf, and after 65 minutes, we finally see a single shot of someone in full costume. Later he actually melts during transformation. The entire budget must have been spent on this scene, and it looks really cool. His body becomes oily and he falls into a pool of liquid while actors who didn't get an adequate werewolf costume watch. Some of them have nothing more than a few hairs on their faces. The melting transformation makes no sense. Things that have melted are categorically prohibited from being solid. Cutting away to German Shepherds running in the dark with glowing red CGI eyes, the werewolves make their way to a church building where they are conveniently destroyed.I have now seen five of the Howling films and this is the worst by a mile.

This doesn't mean that the concept that's presented - that a terrorist who knows where a gigantic bomb in LA will detonate, and is now in a coma, and whose face is ripped off and put on the secret agent who was tracking him for years so the agent can find out the bomb's whereabouts and then the terrorist wakes up from the coma and puts on the agent's face - is entirely plausible. Not for a second. The film was originally set in the future, which is easy to see, and in other hands (less capable ones) it could be a stupid sci-fi channel original movie.In John Woo he sees that the character set-ups and relationships are way too strong to ignore, and the line drawn between supposed good and bad can be blurred in the face of such an outrageous\/clever premise. He hits new heights in filming his action sequences, from the gun battles (and boy there's a lot) to the big motor-boat chase that happens as the climax, to little but wild things like putting 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' for just a half a minute in a blazing gun battle scene. The action has that thrilling sensation of movement and dazzle that Woo had in his HK flicks; if any film comes closest to the relentless intensity of something like Hard Boiled, it's this one (and you know it's just shamelessly by its maker in that church scene, with the doves and the church and the guns and the Mexican stand-off and so on).I haven't mentioned the stars yet? This is a must to understand the appeal of Face\/Off (or, for some, the lack thereof). Nicolas Cage and John Travolta get to have their cake and eat it, play the good but conflicted hero agent Archer (Travolta-cum-Cage) and the overly dastardly villain who just likes to have FUN in big capital letters (Cage-cum-Travolta). While the writing creates some subtext as to deeper levels of interpretation- I'm sure the film could easily be a Jungian thesis project- the actors just enjoy trying (and succeeding) to catch up to Woo's level of high-voltage action and mayhem. Both actors eat up scenery, or sometimes just let the double-level of meaning in the scene take over. When Cage dances in the Priest-frock and sings with the chorus, we know he's going to town, and when Travolta (as that character) smokes a cigarette the first time around his daughter (Papa's got a brand new bag) we can feel the gleeful horror in the room.Sure, eventually the characters are put into a matter of just fists-on-fists, which seems to diminish what other variables of outcome these characters could get into. But then again, it's also a not-guilty pleasure of Hollywood popcorn movie-making, smart and effective in drawing out the characters' conflicts and what those around them have to come to realize (or not, as they may be dead sooner rather than later), and, more often than not, it's cheerfully funny in itself.

The action has that thrilling sensation of movement and dazzle that Woo had in his HK flicks; if any film comes closest to the relentless intensity of something like Hard Boiled, it's this one (and you know it's just shamelessly by its maker in that church scene, with the doves and the church and the guns and the Mexican stand-off and so on).I haven't mentioned the stars yet? This is a must to understand the appeal of Face\/Off (or, for some, the lack thereof). Nicolas Cage and John Travolta get to have their cake and eat it, play the good but conflicted hero agent Archer (Travolta-cum-Cage) and the overly dastardly villain who just likes to have FUN in big capital letters (Cage-cum-Travolta). While the writing creates some subtext as to deeper levels of interpretation- I'm sure the film could easily be a Jungian thesis project- the actors just enjoy trying (and succeeding) to catch up to Woo's level of high-voltage action and mayhem. Both actors eat up scenery, or sometimes just let the double-level of meaning in the scene take over. When Cage dances in the Priest-frock and sings with the chorus, we know he's going to town, and when Travolta (as that character) smokes a cigarette the first time around his daughter (Papa's got a brand new bag) we can feel the gleeful horror in the room.Sure, eventually the characters are put into a matter of just fists-on-fists, which seems to diminish what other variables of outcome these characters could get into. But then again, it's also a not-guilty pleasure of Hollywood popcorn movie-making, smart and effective in drawing out the characters' conflicts and what those around them have to come to realize (or not, as they may be dead sooner rather than later), and, more often than not, it's cheerfully funny in itself. It's like a comic-book concept brought to life and pumped with Woo-stylized bullets and octane - or, in another way, it's like what Michael Bay films try so hard to be and fall flat on their faces in chaos.

Anchored by a simple narrative of a troop of samurai banding together to protect and train a village of farmers from bandit raids, Kurosawa's film extrapolates beyond the mere telling of a story to the foundation of a legend - it is easy to imagine a comparison between a community of audiences seated and enraptured throughout the better part of an afternoon or evening and an indigenous tribe, seated around a fire and passing down their foundational stories and history to a new generation. Kurosawa's film is one which demands attention, but does so without pretension or contrived pitches for trite sentiment - in short, the rare picture which allows its peerless quality to speak for itself.The staple pitch for an 'epic' film of any sort of late is 'synergy between a grandiose scale and conflict and intimate emotional focus', yet Kurosawa's film could have written the book on such a balance. Thinking back over the experience shortly after finishing its exhaustingly tense and thrilling culminating battle (itself cementing the film as essential viewing), it is almost easy to forget how the film draws its primary focus from the exploration of and interactions between its characters, weaving a sumptuous tapestry of very real people and problems, a microcosm of conflict thickened by the noxious looming of the inevitable clash with the bandits. However, proving that spectacle and characterisation not need be mutually exclusive, Kurosawa also delivers what is without doubt one of the most stunning combat films of all time, breathlessly allowing the audience to be privy to the samurai's battle plans and combat formations before allowing all hell to break loose with the cathartic thundering fury of the madness and ferocious joy of war. Nonetheless, for a film largely painting in thundering broad strokes, the complexity, nuance and ambiguity of Kurosawa's work is almost left in the shadows of the 'bigger' moments. It is telling that one of the most moving moments in a film littered with them takes place offscreen, almost an aside, and told with 'blink-and-miss-it' subtlety reflecting on a barely thwarted bandit raid, the samurai notice the absence of one of their number, the live wire, loose cannon Kikuchiyo (Toshirô Mifune). One samurai mumbles that Kikuchiyo is numbly sitting next to the grave of a fallen comrade, an uncharacteristic show of sentiment revealing a previously unseen emotional side to the near deranged fighter. A conventional approach would show provide the image of a grieving Kikuchiyo alone with the grave, yet Kurosawa wisely elects to 'tell not show', thus both giving the viewer a sense of immersion into the plot, forcing them to gracefully respect Kikuchiyo's privacy along with the other samurai and allowing the imagination to instill the scene with all the more power and surging emotion. To see such insight and delicacy of touch in a film boasting such overwhelming dramatic power is the mark of a true genius, and every aspect of Kurosawa's opus is marked with so unique and knowing a flavour of quality, from the astonishingly gorgeous cinematography and composition of shots, the alternatively solemn and playful editing (any familiar with Star Wars' characteristic scene wipes will note Kurosawa's influence),the immaculately recreated period costuming and sets, and Fumio Hayasaka's boldly dramatic musical score, perfectly blending the dignity and power of tradition with the quirkiness and fun of modernity.Even if solely predicated as a character study of wild warrior Kukushiyo, the film could regardless make its mark as an all time classic, as Toshirô Mifune's stunning performance is truly one for the ages. Assigned an already compelling mix of triumph and disgrace, Mifune amps up his charisma and eccentricities to the point of near insanity, not chewing the scenery as much as devouring it. Yet behind the simian hooting and hopping and defiant snarl of laugh, there lies genuine yearning and pain behind Kikuchiyo's eyes, and Mifune is careful to never allow his character's repellent or sympathetic elements to outweigh the other, but instead blending them together with the result of a certifiable triumph and testament towards the impact of an actor's interpretation. The rest of the cast deliver unanimously stellar and often admirably colourful performances, headed up by the incredible serenity and coiled power of Takashi Shimura as the dignified lead samurai Shimada. To retain an audience's interest throughout a three and a half hour film would be a feat in itself, yet the genius of Kurosawa's film is not that it successfully campaigns for attention but rather that the viewer forgets they are watching a film at all, so utterly immersed are they from the chilling opening to bittersweet and sardonically joyful closing.

All About Eve, written and shot by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, was one of the first major triumphs of this new breed of filmmaker. Although it is about actresses, in it writers and directors are cynically lauded as those who construct a tower so that the world can applaud a light which flashes on top of it, while stars are dismissed as pianos who ought to realise they did not write the concerto. But upon seeing the performances in All About Eve, all one can say is what lights... what pianos! Let's begin with the skillful turns of Bette Davis and Anne Baxter. The styles of these two players, like their characters, are mirror images of each other. Davis, true to type, projects a callous and world-weary exterior, and yet I am struck by the depth and sincerity of her emoting, for example as she listens to Eve's sob story in the dressing room scene, or the tenderness she clearly feels for Gary Merrill. It's a depth that it is essential for her character, and yet sensibly she doesn't allow it to dominate, just letting it shine through at key moments. Baxter by contrast is a model of girlish innocence and boundless altruism, yet beneath the surface shows herself to be a treacherous, cold-hearted lizard of a woman. And like Davis's inner warmth, Baxter only reveals that in brief flashes. Hidden depths are something of a running theme in the acting here. Celeste Holm is ostensibly a naive and trusting figure, yet she expertly lays bare the strength of her character in later scenes. Even George Sanders's trademark suave veneer cracks once or twice, giving way to that sharp end of his cynicism which he normally masked.And yet, these supreme talents of the acting profession have been carefully orchestrated by one who has certainly styled himself a builder of cinematic towers. Mankiewicz was a brilliant arranger of motion pictures, and this was far and away his best effort to date. His direction is subtle on the surface - clear, direct shot compositions with no fancy tricks, an invisble camera which only moves to follow the actors - but Mankiewicz himself has hidden depths, and the shooting of All About Eve is in truth a work of considerable complexity. Although his aim was to draw attention the players in the foreground, his work is all about backgrounds. Take the opening scene at the awards ceremony. When we are introduced to the central figures, look at how unnaturally still the extras in the background are. It is the equivalent of shooting these principle players against a blank wall. When Eve goes to accept her award the tactic is reversed. The crowd claps excitedly while Davis et al remain eerily motionless. At other times Mankiewicz's use of backgrounds becomes a direct commentary on events, such as the shot of Davis next to a sign saying Handle with Care.And so Mankiewicz is a true tower constructor of the type described in All About Eve. He is not a show off, and his work though elaborate is all about highlighting the performances and the characters. But it would be doing a major disservice to this wonderful cast to deride them as mere flashing lights, for to quote another picture concerning performance and production, even the most skilled conjurer cannot pull a rabbit out of a hat if there is not already a rabbit in the hat (That's from The Red Shoes, by the way). All About Eve may be shot through with pessimism about the dramatic arts, yet it is the very smoothness of its collaboration - the skill of the tower builders and the brightness of the lights, if you will, both of which are equally important - that make it an engaging and enthralling piece of movie-making.

Pepper, and of course Christopher Lee as Scaramanga, the Man With the Golden Gun.THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN was never one of my favorite James Bond movies, as there are a lot of parts I didn't care for. But the film is pretty good, overall, despite its drawbacks. It holds its place among Bond films.The story follows Bond to the Far East in search of the mysterious Man With the Golden Gun, who is believed to have his sights set on 007. The adventure takes Bond to Macao, Hong Kong, and Thailand. And, conveniently enough, Scaramanga seems to be linked with the energy crisis concerns of Her Majesty's Secret Service.Christopher Lee is great as Scaramanga, an assassin who thrills himself on hunting the most dangerous game. His secluded island hideout provides beautiful exotic scenery. And while I always felt the funhouse mirror sequences were a little weird, I must admit that the filming of the scenes is impressive. The camera captures the confusion of all the reflections nicely.I never liked Nick Nack (Hervé Villechaize), the creepy dwarf sidekick of Scaramanga. He always made me feel uneasy, with his French accent and his waiter's tuxedo. I also never cared for Sheriff J.W. Pepper (Clifton James, reprising his comic relief role from 1973's LIVE AND LET DIE) as the racist American tourist. And even Bernard Lee's M character seemed to have a chip on his shoulder in this film.Another drawback for me is Bond's annoying female partner, Mary Goodnight (Britt Ekland). She's supposed to be an agent, but only serves to muck things up for 007, as if to say that spying is no job for a woman. How she got the job I'll never know, and Bond clearly has little respect for her. (I actually feel sorry for her in one particular bedroom scene.) The much better Bond girl in this film is Maud Adams as Scaramanga's mistress.Roger Moore returns to play James Bond for the second time. The film is the ninth in the series.

I watched a bunch of the cartoon shows & made myself come to grips with THE FINAL FRONTIER (re Shatner's movie), which managed to be fun when regarded as a study in applied narcissism. But boy how I dislike GENERATIONS, and won't be watching it, though I decided to try and deal with my feelings about it once and for all.I think its a cop-out, a cheap sloughing off of responsibility that should have been handled with graceful dignity. This is not the way that I will remember Star Trek. I say that because for me the essence of Star Trek is James Tiberius Kirk, watching him grow & learn. I switched on the spoiler warning disgronifier in case you are not aware that Captain Kirk dies in this movie, and for absolutely no reason at all. It was as if to say his learning curve was arbitrarily being concluded in a re-write, even changing the way he died from the original script (two versions were filmed) for reasons that have never been explained to my satisfaction.I had learned to like TNG and her crew by the time the film premiered, though I think that Tourette's Guy is probably right when he addressed what Brent Spiner is up to these days. Google it if you don't know what I mean, I always despised Data. He was a decent plot device and they did come up with at least one great episode where they got him a sweet girlfriend with nice legs, but enough with the emotion chip already, OK? It's clear that his model was incompatible for the input, they had long milked the gimmick dry, and it turned him into a jerk.I did like watching the saucer section crash, which in a theater looked about as believable as Godzilla destroying Yokohama, enhancing the enjoyment. The producers knew we would get off on seeing it and were so kind as to show the mayhem twice, providing the film with it's two most interesting sequences, thoughtfully shot from different angles for variety. But the rest of the treatment left me cold. I didn't give a damn about the Nexus, which sounded pretty swell compared to graduate school. I went with my fiancée at the time, smuggling in a flask of blackberry brandy so we could drink a toast to Kirk when he finally bought the farm. Turns out the bottle was 3\/4's empty by then due to the draining experience of watching the film. Which looked muddy and rushed, filled with subplots that went nowhere, cameos by assorted Next Generation personalities which distracted from the focus, and a forced sentiment that was at odds with my own feelings about the show.Which was great, don't get me wrong! Heck the TNG episode Tapestry is one of Star Trek's finest hours, whichever series that turned up in rocked. It was just that the series run had come to an end with a superb show-stopper of its own. There was no unfinished business left to attend to, no need to pass the baton as producer Rick Berman put it, by having the Original Series crew and Next Generation crew appear in a film at all. The classic crew made a rousing, emotional exit in the very satisfying THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY. Kirk had said himself in the soliloquy that it was the final adventure for that crew, but by forcing the issue Shatner became the proverbial drunk who wouldn't leave after the party was obviously over.Which in many ways turns out to be the case as Shatner used his studio muscle to not just get himself written into the picture but threatening to direct at one point. The whole subplot involving Kirk is a distraction from the rest of the story and feels superimposed, though yes, the horse riding scenes with Picard are nice. But if they had to happen at the expense of the dignity of Kirk's character then they were as unwelcome as his demise. Shatner also bullied himself into the film specifically to have his character killed off heroically, then posited himself to come back in the 2009 prequel film, as if. I now realize he deserved to be left out of that one, having cast his fate already. It was about time someone made Bill keep his place in the line after such an unnecessary curtain call.Kirk deserved a better movie to go out in, or rather his own movie if it was that damn important. And I say it wasn't Why kill off anyone in the Star Trek universe at all if there are an infinite number of ways to bring them back? Emotional death scenes suck, and it made the film perfunctory or formulaic in my eyes, trying to fix what wasn't broke in the first place. On its own the Next Generation crew's story was pretty good, and from what I've read a lot of what they would have been doing ended up being chopped out to make room for Kirk's scenes back when A-list talent movies at least didn't run three friggen hours. This crew was short changed, eventually coming back to make at least one good feature in FIRST CONTACT, though by then my heart just wasn't in it anymore in part due to GENERATIONS.So I don't know. I thought maybe I had confused my feelings for the woman I had gone to see this with the film itself, which I have seen since on home video and didn't like any more. Actually less, wishing I'd had more of that blackberry brandy or at least a six pack of Romulan ale. Here is a Star Trek movie that will drive a classic series fan to drink, and that isn't ever a pretty thing.4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"21 April 2010","score":"13 out of 19 people found the following review useful","review":" Been home nursing an emergency tooth extraction over the past week and nothing was able to assuage the misery like wallowing in Star Trek.

He was a decent plot device and they did come up with at least one great episode where they got him a sweet girlfriend with nice legs, but enough with the emotion chip already, OK? It's clear that his model was incompatible for the input, they had long milked the gimmick dry, and it turned him into a jerk.I did like watching the saucer section crash, which in a theater looked about as believable as Godzilla destroying Yokohama, enhancing the enjoyment. The producers knew we would get off on seeing it and were so kind as to show the mayhem twice, providing the film with it's two most interesting sequences, thoughtfully shot from different angles for variety. But the rest of the treatment left me cold. I didn't give a damn about the Nexus, which sounded pretty swell compared to graduate school. I went with my fiancée at the time, smuggling in a flask of blackberry brandy so we could drink a toast to Kirk when he finally bought the farm. Turns out the bottle was 3\/4's empty by then due to the draining experience of watching the film. Which looked muddy and rushed, filled with subplots that went nowhere, cameos by assorted Next Generation personalities which distracted from the focus, and a forced sentiment that was at odds with my own feelings about the show.Which was great, don't get me wrong! Heck the TNG episode Tapestry is one of Star Trek's finest hours, whichever series that turned up in rocked. It was just that the series run had come to an end with a superb show-stopper of its own. There was no unfinished business left to attend to, no need to pass the baton as producer Rick Berman put it, by having the Original Series crew and Next Generation crew appear in a film at all. The classic crew made a rousing, emotional exit in the very satisfying THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY. Kirk had said himself in the soliloquy that it was the final adventure for that crew, but by forcing the issue Shatner became the proverbial drunk who wouldn't leave after the party was obviously over.Which in many ways turns out to be the case as Shatner used his studio muscle to not just get himself written into the picture but threatening to direct at one point. The whole subplot involving Kirk is a distraction from the rest of the story and feels superimposed, though yes, the horse riding scenes with Picard are nice. But if they had to happen at the expense of the dignity of Kirk's character then they were as unwelcome as his demise. Shatner also bullied himself into the film specifically to have his character killed off heroically, then posited himself to come back in the 2009 prequel film, as if. I now realize he deserved to be left out of that one, having cast his fate already. It was about time someone made Bill keep his place in the line after such an unnecessary curtain call.Kirk deserved a better movie to go out in, or rather his own movie if it was that damn important. And I say it wasn't Why kill off anyone in the Star Trek universe at all if there are an infinite number of ways to bring them back? Emotional death scenes suck, and it made the film perfunctory or formulaic in my eyes, trying to fix what wasn't broke in the first place. On its own the Next Generation crew's story was pretty good, and from what I've read a lot of what they would have been doing ended up being chopped out to make room for Kirk's scenes back when A-list talent movies at least didn't run three friggen hours. This crew was short changed, eventually coming back to make at least one good feature in FIRST CONTACT, though by then my heart just wasn't in it anymore in part due to GENERATIONS.So I don't know.

I watched a bunch of the cartoon shows & made myself come to grips with THE FINAL FRONTIER (re Shatner's movie), which managed to be fun when regarded as a study in applied narcissism. But boy how I dislike GENERATIONS, and won't be watching it, though I decided to try and deal with my feelings about it once and for all.I think its a cop-out, a cheap sloughing off of responsibility that should have been handled with graceful dignity. This is not the way that I will remember Star Trek. I say that because for me the essence of Star Trek is James Tiberius Kirk, watching him grow & learn. I switched on the spoiler warning disgronifier in case you are not aware that Captain Kirk dies in this movie, and for absolutely no reason at all.

It hardly has the look or feel of a Bond film. It's surprisingly gritty and violent. Cold-blooded killing, shark attacks, bone-crushing grinders, people burned alive, etc. There's nothing fun about this movie. James Bond is fueled by a personal vendetta, after his pal Felix winds up in a hospital. He is stripped of his British Secret Service-mandated license to kill and goes off on his own, hell-bent on revenge.The film marked the second and last time Timothy Dalton would portray 007. (Overall it was the sixteenth film in the series.) The action takes place in the Florida Keys and Latin America.The first hour or so is barely distinguishable from any other late-'80s American action flick. The movie gets rolling once the action shifts from Florida to South America. We get glimpses of Bond's MI6 buddies (M, Moneypenny, Q), we see Bond dress up in a tuxedo and visit a casino, we see the latest in cutting-edge spy gadgets, and we are introduced to the film's crazy character. This time around, the part is played by famous Las Vegas entertainer Wayne Newton. His character is a sort of televangelist whose spiritual resorts serve as a cover for an illegal drug circle.Carey Lowell plays a CIA agent who helps 007 take on the drug cartel. She's a pretty good Bond girl, proving to be quite capable of handling any situation. And she's not too hard on the eyes, either. The other Bond beauty in the film is Talisa Soto as the drug kingpin Sanchez's girlfriend. Sanchez is played ruthlessly by rough-faced Robert Davi, with a young Benicio Del Toro playing one of his henchmen.It's also nice to see Q (Desmond Llewelyn) have more to do out in the field, assisting 007 while on leave from MI6.Timothy Dalton is a good actor and he has some fine moments as Bond in this entry. It was cool seeing a resourceful James Bond work his way into the villain's good graces. And I enjoyed the final scene in the film where Bond jumps into the pool. It would have been interesting to see Dalton continue in the role of the super-spy.I admit LICENCE TO KILL is one of my least favorite James Bond movies. I don't like the way it starts off, but it improves about halfway in and it's not *that* bad. Just not as good as other films in the series. It's probably the most serious of the pre-Daniel Craig Bonds, without much of the wit and sense of adventure that made the franchise so popular. There's plenty of gritty action and excellent stuntwork, but I still find the film somewhat lacking.

Arletty is also friendly with the marvellously roguish Pierre-Francois Lacenaire (Marcel Herrand), who initially claims to have no feelings for her but who is, in truth, as besotted as Baptiste. It's Frederick (Pierre Brasseur), a budding actor, with whom Garance has an affair however. Until, that is, she is falsely accused of robbing a debt collector and must call on the help of wealthy admirer Abril (Fabien Loris).That this film ever got made at all is something of a miracle. It took eighteen months, in the midst of a world war which saw financial backers bailing out as the tide of that war turned. It sheltered refugees from the Nazis and gave them work on its crew, even as its leading lady conducted an affair with a Nazi officer. That all involved managed to create something so close to masterful under such trying conditions is, therefore, something of a minor miracle.This film contains individual scenes that achieve brilliance and that will stay with you to such a degree that you might be tempted to play just this scene or that every now and then to remind yourself of its brilliance. Despite including real characters, it creates a strangely isolated world of lovers and rogues, artists and drunks, tramps and eccentrics whose interplay is entirely believable, as too is the diverging paths through life each takes as they eventually converge once more to reach a tragic finale. The literate dialogue might be a little flowery on occasion, but the sophistication and depth of the story &#x96; just try imagining an American film from the same period, stifled by the restrictions of the Hays Code and the studio system, that could claim to come anywhere near to what this one achieves &#x96; draws the viewer in and immerses it in its world.The story is essentially a study of the various forms of unrequited love, of the way it can become a controlling force in a person's life, give them hope, or lead them to despair. Each character in the film is largely moulded into what they become by their love, which is why, perhaps, it ends in the way it does, because this is one of the few films where you can truly believe that the characters and the story will still go on once the film is over, and that the surviving characters' feelings for one another will never change.The film is long, but each scene is used with such incisive skill by Carne and writer Prevert to inform the audience of the thoughts and emotions of the characters that the time flies by and you come to understand them so well that, when the film is finally over, you really don't want to leave.

That all involved managed to create something so close to masterful under such trying conditions is, therefore, something of a minor miracle.This film contains individual scenes that achieve brilliance and that will stay with you to such a degree that you might be tempted to play just this scene or that every now and then to remind yourself of its brilliance. Despite including real characters, it creates a strangely isolated world of lovers and rogues, artists and drunks, tramps and eccentrics whose interplay is entirely believable, as too is the diverging paths through life each takes as they eventually converge once more to reach a tragic finale.

Each character in the film is largely moulded into what they become by their love, which is why, perhaps, it ends in the way it does, because this is one of the few films where you can truly believe that the characters and the story will still go on once the film is over, and that the surviving characters' feelings for one another will never change.The film is long, but each scene is used with such incisive skill by Carne and writer Prevert to inform the audience of the thoughts and emotions of the characters that the time flies by and you come to understand them so well that, when the film is finally over, you really don't want to leave. ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"21 April 2010","score":"","review":" It's a wonder that nobody has made a film about the making of this film it certainly has enough tales of resistance fighters, Jewish refugees and Nazi collaborators to merit one. Often hailed as France's greatest movie, it's undoubtedly an event, and has an epic feel to it, even though the story takes place in one small part of Paris over a space of a few years.Arletty (incredibly, closing in on 50 when she made this), plays Garance, a woman taking part in a sideshow attraction when we meet her, who meets a young mime artist, Baptiste (Jean-Louis Barrault) who quickly falls under her spell. Arletty is also friendly with the marvellously roguish Pierre-Francois Lacenaire (Marcel Herrand), who initially claims to have no feelings for her but who is, in truth, as besotted as Baptiste. It's Frederick (Pierre Brasseur), a budding actor, with whom Garance has an affair however. Until, that is, she is falsely accused of robbing a debt collector and must call on the help of wealthy admirer Abril (Fabien Loris).That this film ever got made at all is something of a miracle. It took eighteen months, in the midst of a world war which saw financial backers bailing out as the tide of that war turned.
