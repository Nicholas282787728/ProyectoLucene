But when I went to bed last night, I had just finished watching KLUTE (for the first time) on TCM. As I walked upstairs and turned off the light, a wave of cinemotion overcame me. In a brief moment, I realised 'I don't like KLUTE.' A pause, and then another realisation 'I think it's okay not to like KLUTE. I can't like every motion picture I see.' And I tried to shrug it off and went to bed.It is morning now. And I still don't like KLUTE. And I am trying to figure out why. ***possible spoilers ahead***First major thought. It tries too hard to be a romance. I think it would have been better if they didn't hook up (the characters played by Fonda and Sutherland). I also would have made Sutherland's character impotent, or else some sort of religious guy who did not believe in sex outside marriage, so that Fonda had more of a challenge. He was easy pickings for her and this bored me.Second major thought. The film and Pakula's direction is too self-conscious. It keeps trying to remind us how hip it is, whether it's Fonda's costuming or the spicy dicey soundtrack or the agonizing self-recriminations that Fonda undergoes inside her therapist's office. The whole thing seems like laying down naked on a lonely stretch of beach and expecting a cool wave to engulf you, but the tide doesn't really come in and only vultures swoop down and start to pick at you. Third major thought. The story itself is weak and clichéd and dragged out. The characterizations are supposed to keep us riveted in those moments when the plot has come to a screeching halt. Sometimes that works, but most of the time it is tedious and we just want the story to move forward, to pick up the pace.Fourth major point. What I enjoyed most in KLUTE was the editing. And I think it is because there were so many dull spots that the editors had to work some magic to create the illusion there was action when there really wasn't any.Fifth major point. I think she should have died at the end. And I think if they had not physically consummated the relationship, it would have been even more powerful and haunting if he walked the streets thinking about her and what maybe could have been. As it is, the ending tries to be a bit tongue-in-cheek ironic, with her leaving town with him and getting a call from a john-- but I really don't think we should be smiling when this picture ends.Sixth major point. I read some user reviews here on the IMDb where people complained the film's title was KLUTE (as opposed to BREE). But I do think this is correct. In the context of this story, she comes to be defined by him. But too much goes undeveloped. The name KLUTE, the mere presence of KLUTE, should be both an impediment and her potential salvation. She should be haunted by this word, this guy, and how it is threatening her own independence-- as much as she is haunted by the demented john who is stalking her. So some of this is not fully fleshed out.Seventh major point. I think she should have been even more shocking. My favorite scene is the one that takes place in the club-- we do not see Klute right away, but we can guess he is watching her. This particular sequence is complete voyeurism and fun to watch. We the audience are made to feel like we are on some sort of footing with Klute, watching her as he watches her. But I think she should have played it up more-- she should have taken one of those guys, even her pimp, into a dark hallway to toy with Klute, and she should have pretended to have lesbian tendencies flirting with another woman, to toy with Klute. In short, she should have owned that scene by playing into his own frustrated fantasies which I am sure she understood inside and out.

During a field trip, a radioactive spider escapes from its cage and it bites Parker on the hand! The spider bite gives him superpowers such as a Spideysense and the ability to shoot webs. In the comic book, Peter uses prosthetic web shooters. In the Spiderman movies, the web shooters are organic. Peter Parker has a crush on Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst), a redheaded girl who goes to the same high school. After Peter's uncle Ben Parker(Cliff Robertson) is killed by a mugger, Peter fights crime as Spiderman. Spiderman has to help people as the malevolent, psychotic, power-hungry Green Goblin(Willem Dafoe) kills people in New York. TV's Spiderman and his Amazing Friends(1982) and a Spiderman T-shirt that I wore in 1985 were my first exposure to Spiderman. Although, Spiderman has been around since the 1960's. A live action Spiderman movie project was passed around from studio to studio. Cannon Films had the Spiderman filmmaking rights at one time. At one time, James Cameron was going to direct the film. A movie poster and a movie trailer with the World Trade Center was used to promote the Spiderman movie in 2001. Both disappeared after the Terrorist Attack on September 11th, 2001. Spiderman(2002) is jam-packed with patriotism and flag-waving. The visual effects in Spiderman have been criticized for looking rubbery and cartoonish, but they get the job done. The visual effects in Spiderman 2(2004) and Spiderman 3(2007) make it up to us by having eye-popping, glossy visual effects.

I mean you internet critics, are you just so pretentious that not even good movies are up to your standards? If it isn't a Christopher Nolan or James Cameron film then it's just garbage? Okay, preference in movies is opinionated I get that. But as film critics you are not there to judge overall films by simple minded Duhhhh did I like it? No you are supposed to break them down in characters, story, imagery, acting, scenery and dialog. Also you won't be able to correctly judge a film without empathy.Sorry, I just wanted to make sure people understood how to critique a film. Because for this film to win almost a dozen Razzies one of which being The worst film of the decade for 1980's clearly shows the majority of critics forgot how to critique a film. I guess it's possible the Razzies never had a sense of good judgement to begin with but wouldn't there be at least one person there who would come out and say Maybe the films we make fun of aren't bad maybe we're just stupid? sadly it hasn't happened it.Anyways on to the movie... Mommie Dearest is a movie adaptation of a book written by Christina Crawford the adopted daughter of Joan Crawford. The book is about Christina's childhood and relationship with her mother, who is a famous actress. The book showcases alcoholism, child abuse, child neglect and the cold harsh reality of Hollywood.

His premonition of imminent disaster leads to him and several other characters leaving the subsequently doomed flight. However, 'Death' will not be cheated so easily...The first act of this film leading up to and including the destruction of Flight 180 leads us to believe that we are watching a horror film with serious intent. Whilst there are comic vignettes being played out in typical teen fashion there is an underlying build up of tension.Unfortunately for this viewer at least, as soon as the characters are delineated and plot development clearly laid out, any serious intent is drowned out by an over-clever reliance on the formulaic filmmaking which has become the norm with this genre. Lead - or rather, 'stock' - characters other than our hero include the obligatory quirky girl Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), tough guy Carter Horton (Kerr Smith chewing up the scenery), his trampish girl Terry Chaney (Amanda Detmer), the hero's best friend Tod Waggner (Chad Donella), Billy Hitchcock (Sean William Scott) and teacher Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke). We can gain virtually no satisfaction at this point in working out the survival rate and the order of demise. Minor, yet somehow more interesting roles are given to Tony Todd as mortician Bludworth (a wasted part seemingly used simply to explain what is going on), and Daniel Roebuck alongside Roger Guenveur Smith as FBI Agents Weine and Schreck respectively, nicely bouncing off each other. Death's modus operandi veers between extremely complicated with lots of red herrings along the way (Tod's suicidal tendencies giving way to an eventual accidental hanging; Mrs. Lewton and a bizarre combination of steam, gas, electricity, alcohol, fire and kitchen knives), to the dramatic take-your-breath away split-second splattering moment (both Terry and Billy).Unfortunately this is not enough to sustain our interest for what seems an overlong hour and a half. Clunky dialogue, predictable turns (particularly the 'twist' ending) and a story that (despite other reviewers - probably much younger than myself - claiming otherwise)is hardly original in concept leaves us with a finished product which whilst not being 'bad' simply does not rise above the dross that makes up the vast majority of this genre. for this we have to blame director and co-writer James Wong along with his writing cohorts Glen Morgan and Jeffrey Reddick. The overuse of foreshadowing along with too many visual references - '180' pops up again and again which would be fine if the film were released under the working title of Flight 180 - in-jokes like naming characters after famous horror stars and directors; and an obsession with people sitting on toilet seats all indicate the fun the makers were having. All of which simply detracts from the point of the exercise. Background music courtesy of Adam Hamilton and Shirley Walker could best be described as a cross between forgettable and bland but fortunately remains firmly in the background.The estimated budget for this film was $23 million, most of which, judging by the credits, went on special effects which were actually fairly impressive.

But things go wrong and our group of scientists have to escape the island filled with dinosaurs Notable Acting I wasn't sold on the actors, I found most of them boring or unbearable. The child actors annoyed me and made me want the raptors to find them in the kitchen scene. Ellie felt like the typical hot nerd character, useless to all extents but smart and attractive to watch. I did like the chemistry between Sam Neill's and Jeff Goldlbum's characters how they were both trying to show themselves as the bigger man and impress Ellie. I liked Samuel L. Jackson's and BD Wong's secondary characters, shame we didn't get to see much more of them. Chances are Bob Peck will only be remember for the Clever Girl meme. Noticeable Camera work Birds eye shot of the group of paleontologists trying to unearth a fossil. Worms eye shot climbing the electric fence. This movie is lacking of creative shots Graphics The CGI in this movie was breath taking for the time when the movie came out 90s, they were able to blend it with the animatronics amazingly well. Incorrect Science The names on the embryo freezing chamber are wrong in two sections, Tyrannosaurus Rex and Stegosaurus are misspelled. Raptors did not use their claws to eviscerate, their claws were not strong enough for that, this is why they would go for the throat. There have be experiments about this. Most of the characters address the dinosaurs as he when it was clearly stated that they were all female. Timmy shouldn't have gotten hurt by the electric fence as he isn't grounded, so he is basically a bird on a power line at this point. DNA degrades after 521 years un-persevered and 1000 years if frozen, so this whole movie just went down the plot hole. Dr Grant throws a branch at the fence to test if it is live or not, wood is an insulator and throwing it would make it not grounded. None of the heavy hitting dinosaurs in this movie are from the Jurassic era, they are from the Cretaceous era, so the movie shouldn't be called 'Jurassic Park', it should be called 'Cretaceous Park' but there are Brachiosaurus and Dilophosaurus which are both from the Jurassic era. The velociraptors in this movie are incorrect as velociraptors are only knee hight on a 6 foot person, the raptors in this movie are Deinonychus raptors which are generally 5 foot or so in hight. They may have gotten the dinosaur DNA from the blood in the amber, but that doesn't explain how they were able to bring back extinct plants that Dr Sattler was holding. Remember the first time the T-rex was on screen? It made the water shake with it's footsteps, you never see any of that in the final scene where is saves the group from the raptors. It would also make T-rex a failed predator if its prey could hear it miles away. Brachiosaurs are too heavy to stand on one set of legs. Gum Tree leaves are also known as eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to almost every animal. Reptiles do not and cannot sneeze, that is purely a mammal action. DNA mixing does not work like it did in the movie, frog DNA is a bad choice, so would any amphibian DNA. Why not use avian DNA? Seeing as dinosaurs evolved into birds, it would make sense.Overall Feel This movie apparently inspired a generation of paleontologists.

I have already mentioned how this movie doesn't know all that much about DNA, dinosaurs or paleontology in general, but I must admit that their effects are so good that you forget about all of its faults for the time being.

Is it wrong to say that the best Fred Astaire picture happens to be one without Ginger Rogers? In the case of Vincente Minnelli's wonderful 1953 musical masterpiece The Band Wagon, I think not. This is the film that answers the question how does MGM follow up a big hit like Singin' in the Rain (1952)? Well, for starters, getting Betty Comden and Adolph Green, the same screenwriters of that film, to write the script for this one is a pretty darn good idea. Furthermore, changing the focus from Hollywood to Broadway isn't a bad idea either. And instead of Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen taking over the director's chair, we'll have Vincente Minnelli, the director of Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), lead the charge. Sure, Gene Kelly won't be in this picture, but do you know who will be? None other than the talented dancer who helped teach Debbie Reynolds how to dance, Fred Astaire. YES! Now we're talking! Fred Astaire plays Tony Hunter, a washed-up Hollywood star who has recently quit the business and heads back to New York to try his luck out on Broadway. His two pals Lester and Lily Marton (Oscar Levant, Nanette Fabray) think they have the perfect script for his comeback. They are able to get popular Broadway director Jeffrey Cordova (Jack Buchanan) to sign on for directing their play. However, Jeff insists on changing the light comedy into a dark and dramatic retelling of Faust, which Tony thinks is outside his comfort zone. If that wasn't enough, a young and beautiful ballerina named Gabrielle Gerard (Cyd Charisse) is signed on to be his co-star. Gabrielle also intimidates Tony because he has trouble dancing with ladies that are taller than him and feels that he doesn't have enough classical background to be dancing in her league. Will Tony and his pals be able to pull off a successful show even with all these obstacles working against them? Would you believe me if I told you that Tony's concerns over dancing with his co-star Gabrielle was written especially for the film because it really happened on set? I'm not even kidding. On the making of featurette on the 2-disc DVD of this film, they said that Fred Astaire was concerned over the height of Cyd Charisse. Keeping this trivia in mind, I applaud the screenwriters for having the guts and the great sense of humor to put those details into the script as it was happening on set. Also on the aforementioned featurette, the screenwriters Comden and Green stated that the troubles the film's characters were experiencing while preparing for this production were based on things these two had experienced while participating in other theatrical productions. And you know what? I completely buy that these kinds of situations happened in real-life. I'm convinced that there are some Broadway directors who put too much scenery on set or that the guys operating the sets keep going the wrong way because they can't see what they're doing. It's completely believable in that sense. In the tradition of Singin' in the Rain, The Band Wagon is yet another MGM musical in which it was a miracle that it came together as well as it did. The 'making of' featurette for this picture seemed to imply that this was not a pleasant production. Once again, some of the picture's main stars couldn't get along with each other very well. Oscar Levant drove then-newcomer Nanette Fabray nuts because she stated that he was always looking for someone or something to put the blame on whenever he did a take wrong. But when she told him to go to hell during the production, I guess that shut him up good. Well played, Ms. Fabray. And of course, it's a testament to both Levant and Fabray's delightful work in this film that they make us forget their struggles together during production. Fabray in particular makes everything better whenever she's on screen with her positivity and endearing charm throughout. The Band Wagon literally makes you also forget about the troubles Minnelli was having at the time with his wife Judy Garland and the painstaking hours of rehearsal Astaire used to make his dances perfect. Speaking of the songs and dances, the music by Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz is some of the very best. That's Entertainment is arguably the greatest song ever written for the big screen. Not since Make 'Em Laugh have I heard a song that is the ultimate summary of what Hollywood is all about. It's a bittersweet reminder that anything can be considered entertainment to each and every one of us. Excellent message, terrific melody and rhythm, and outstanding lyrics, this song is a certified classic. And what worthy songs it's accompanied by. It's not every day you come across numbers such as Dancing in the Dark and The Girl Hunt which solely contain music and no singing. But it's all for the better since they showcase both Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse's dancing skills at their best. The endurance, variety of movements, and enjoyment that Astaire and Charisse demonstrate in these numbers are second to none. You truly don't see talent like that anymore. Every single musical number is simply perfection from the Shine On Your Shoes number in the recreation center to the I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan duet between Astaire and Buchanan. If I were to talk about every single excellent thing about The Band Wagon, we'd probably be here all day. So I'll shorten the rest of my thoughts down for those who haven't seen it yet. All five of the main actors have charisma to spare. The entire soundtrack is sublime. The writing is sensational and relatable. The dance sequences are some of the finest. The stylish production and cinematography are all top notch. Get aboard The Band Wagon indeed. ","genre":null},{"date":"2 August 2014","score":"","review":" Here's the question of the century.

She dreams about a little girl being taken away by a stranger, in her neighbourhood. When her own daughter is kidnapped and murdered only a little later, Claire is sure about the chilling truth that her and the killer's mind are connected to each other in dreams. But nobody believes her ability to foresee the killer's next steps, as she could with her own daughter. In addition, the nervous breakdown she suffers gets her into a mental facility after a suicide attempt. And here, she dreams of her husband being murdered...You could open up a whole can of worms when you analyse this piece from Jordan. Many have stated that it's the worse film ever made, but that's just a joke. As someone once said, someone's trash is another's treasure, and whilst Jordan has really gone over the top in some aspects, his genius is evident in several scenes.Apples here are the order of the day, is it referring to Snow White, as the play suggests at the beginning, or is it the forbidden fruit? After all, Claire's husband nearly strayed off the path, and Vivian's forbidden fruit is obviously his mother, as he has Freudian issues with her.Its a unique version, and some scenes are very disturbing, but it's certainly a visual treat, even if some of the narrative is a little off par, but then, one could argue, that the whole film consists of dreams within a dream, within a dream, and so on, so this is why the film will be heralded as a masterpiece to some, and a dogs dinner to others.Bening is great as the grieving mother, but once again, Downey Jr is wonderful, in some scenes he looks like the pre transformation wolf in Jordan's The Company Of Wolves, which this film reminded me of from time to time.Whether she dreamt it all, or it was reality, it's still a curiosity piece indeed, and worth watching more than once.....

While Jurassic Park was seen by many as a stalwart family film, Spielberg took a different direction with The Lost World in making it a darker suspense\/thriller movie. This is seen even in the character progression, as Goldblum's Malcolm in this film is notably more sceptical and cynical than in the original. Julianne Moore and Vince Vaughn both step up well to the main cast, although one of the film's strongest performances comes from Pete Postlethwaite (playing Roland), who lights up the pockets of screen-time in which he features. As in the original, Spielberg pays great attention to the dinosaurs themselves, with superb CGI and animatronics back in full force to make the dinosaurs seem well and truly alive.

He's back as the undead child-killer who attacks teenagers in their dreams and this time&#x85; well, who cares, right? By Part 4 of any horror franchise you pretty much know the set-up. Teens.

Plus (and I always thought this aspect elevated the Freddy films over the 'Jason films') because the death scenes happen in a 'dream world' they are always a lot more imaginative and fun than simply seeing a man in a hockey mask chopping a semi-naked teen up.Personally, I enjoy seeing Freddy have fun and 'mess' with his victims. I think it makes him more evil. However, some long-standing fans of the franchise felt that Freddy was getting too 'comical' to be taken seriously. That's one opinion, but I disagree.Basically, Nightmare 4 is worth a look if you're a fan of the franchise or like cheesy eighties horror films. Just don't expect great acting from anyone other than Englund. The other actors really don't seem to be up to the job (or, to be fair on them, this fault could lie with the writers\/director) and recite their stilted dialogue with all the conviction of a cheap daytime soap.

I saw this movie for the first time just a few months ago, but decided to review it AFTER I'd read the book. Couldn't believe some of the differences. Yes, the cheating wife was in the fashion business, and yes the cheating husband was a lawyer, but in the book the cheated husband is not an IA Cop, he's an assistant to a congressman, and the cheated wife is not a congresswoman, but a housewife with a small child, a boy!! I'm not sure why the whole side story of him being a cop and the whole story that went with it was added. I watched the movie a second time, and pretty much FF'd thru the whole police thing. The whole trip to Miami was nowhere in the book, nor was there a sister to Kay. Also in the book, there was more detail on Peyton's family background being all Italians and hating Dutch (his name is Edward in the book) for taking Peyton (Lily in the book) away from the family and not being Catholic. I really think the movie could've been more interesting to a lot of the reviewers had they used more of the book material. Also missing in the movie was Peyton's AND Kay's pregnancies. Even so, I enjoyed the movie. I think Harrison Ford is excellent, but thinking back, to have him an expectant father would not work at his age (the characters are younger in the book). Finally, I was looking forward to clarification of the steamy, albeit a little awkward, scene in the car between Kay and Dutch, but that too is nowhere in the book. I was almost disappointed reading when and how they first hook up as it wasn't nearly as exciting as the movie version. I'd still recommend this as a decent movie. Have to admit Harrison Ford was the main attraction for me. But I'd also recommend the book as a supplement to the story.

Yes, the cheating wife was in the fashion business, and yes the cheating husband was a lawyer, but in the book the cheated husband is not an IA Cop, he's an assistant to a congressman, and the cheated wife is not a congresswoman, but a housewife with a small child, a boy!! I'm not sure why the whole side story of him being a cop and the whole story that went with it was added. I watched the movie a second time, and pretty much FF'd thru the whole police thing.
