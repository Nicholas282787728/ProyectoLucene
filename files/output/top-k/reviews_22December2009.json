The original series & this Hollywood sci-fi action adventure share the same name, character's & basic premise but the tone is different as this is played very straight with little or no humour. At over two hours in length Lost in Space goes on for maybe ten or fifteen minutes too long & while the first ninety odd minutes are great stuff the final third is rather dull & drags too, a sub-plot about time travel kicks in & it all becomes a bit confusing with various plot holes & questions left unanswered as well as a horrible moment in which the old Will Robinson suddenly realises after twenty years that the huge giant mutant monster thing isn't his friend after all & this time travel subplot feels tacked on & unnecessary. Uptil that point Lost in Space is a cracking space adventure with enough heart & message to even have a little meaning as well, there are some great scenes like the finding & exploring of the deserted Proteus, a space battle at the start, a spectacular launch, a huge robot going crazy & firing laser beams everywhere, mutant alien spiders, a crash landing & the Jupiter II being pulled towards the sun in a frantic battle to escape it's heat to name just a few. The dynamic between the family members is a little clichéd (the dad not spending enough time with his kids, scientist & soldier not agreeing with each other, brother & sister constantly teasing each other) & I really could have done without that comic relief silly looking alien monkey thing but overall I reckon there's more than enough here to keep one entertained even if it is a bit longish & the time travel aspect is poorly handled.I watched this on DVD last night & maybe a Hi-Def Blu-ray might show the combination of CGI computer & practical model effects up a bit more I actually thought they were mostly excellent, from the spaceships to the huge explosions to the alien spiders to a cool climax where West has to pilot the Jupiter II through the core of a planet as it breaks up although there is one major flaw which lets them down, the Zachery spider monster which frankly looks terrible. Not only is this spider mutant thing poorly designed the CGI effects are awful & unfortunately that's probably the thing most people will remember about the film, the one awful effect rather than the dozens of excellent ones. The production design is also worthy of mention as this is a great looking film that obviously had a lot of time & money spent on it, the sleek curved interiors of the spaceships or the cool computer interfaces & graphics & the various alien planet landscapes & such look great & really hold up well even when viewed today (or yesterday as I did...).With a supposed budget of about $80,000,000 this was shot here in the UK in London & was meant to kick off a franchise but despite being the film that knocked the mighty Titanic (1997) off the top spot in the box-office charts it did moderate business & no further films were made.

The film's a remake of La Totale!, a dull French film.

Upon release, True Lies was reportedly the most expensive movie ever made. As is typical of Cameron, the film looks immaculate, the director bringing his trademark perfectionism to each shot. Several of the film's action sequences also have the massive, logistical ballsiness we associate with Cameron's later work. The guy doesn't take impossible! for an answer. Unfortunately as Cameron's films get slicker, bigger and more expensive, they also get less interesting and less intense than his work in the 1980s. True Lies is safe, bloated and its comedic elements undermine all tension. It's hard to feel on the edge of your seat when everything is played for laughs. The film's CGI heavy final act was a big deal back in the 1990s (an audacious set piece with US Harriers), but today is wholly routine and generates little buzz. The film's best action sequence is perhaps a simple bathroom brawl, inspired by Hong Kong cinema. It would influence a similar brawl in The Matrix.Comparisons with Spielberg are apt, as both directors began their careers making lean, violent pulp (Jaws, Duel, Terminator, Aliens) before quickly becoming bloated, preachy, watered-down directors. Cameron would replace the darkness of Aliens with the hokey Spielbergian ending of The Abyss and fills both True Lies and Terminator 2 with annoying kids. By the time he got to Titanic and Avatar, Cameron would be more comfortable making PG12 films for his now infantilized audience.Upon release True Lies was widely bashed for being racist (the bad guys are stereotypical middle eastern terrorists who want to nuke America!) and sexist (women are only cool if they're stripping or hanging from our hero's arms). Arnie is himself your typical All American Boyscout while the film's terrorists are neutered, castrated, sexless, and incompetent. Virtually all action movies play by these rules, hero and audience pumped full of blood and ready to sodomise. As masculinity must be constantly reconstructed, these films play like hilarious representations of male anxieties, and all become camp with time. Today the only cast member who comes off looking good is cult favourite Bill Paxton. Arnie looks good when smashing skulls - he moves like a machine, a bipedal tank chassis - but like a child molester whenever he tries to smile or seem loving and sweet.

He looks at the Western and thinks, 'OK, let's throw in some Sergio Leone Spaghetti fun in here, from the opening ala Fistful of Dollars, and the main crux of the vengeance plot can have something to do with Once Upon a Time in the West- flashback included, of course.' While he thinks this, he's also still making the film his own in a lot of ways, notably in the gunfights. It's mostly a serious film though, not a dark comedy like Evil Dead or silly like Army of Darkness, even if there is a sense of subtle self-parody among some of the actors cast.Oh, a note about the cast this is one of the strangest but, on the whole, most effective ensembles of the 1990's. You've got everyone here you'd want to see in a guy movie from the time, with a few surprises Keith David, Lance Henrikson, Woody Strode (also from 'Once Upon a Time'), Russell Crowe, Leonardo DiCaprio (yes, back when he was, to the girls, 'Leo', here aka The Kid), Tobin Bell (yes, again, Jigsaw from Saw). But to top it off are two stars at the top of the bill (shared with Crowe and DiCaprio) that is a truly mixed bag. Both of the stars contribute, and take away, from the merits of the story, about a gunslinger competition that is more akin, to anything, of a Gladiatorial competition as it's to the death and run by a ruthless quasi-emperor (you can even see Crowe in a pre-Maximus role here as the Preacher).It's stars Gene Hackman and Sharon Stone that makes this compelling and curiously uninteresting at the same time. Hackman is one thing he's taking on a role that is far more actually evil (if not quite as scary in his humane way in Unforgiven), as the head of the town who strikes fear into everyone so much that you can feel the chill in the room in blazing hot weather. Hackman's delivery of the dialog is better than any other conceivable actor in the role, and he also is there in one of the movie's best scenes- maybe the one truly genius one all-around- where we see the first time that someone is shot rather gruesomely, and there's a slight pause from the onlookers, and then the most forced-polite applause ever seen. Watching Hackman alone is perhaps reason enough, even if you're not a Sam Raimi fan, to see Quick and the Dead.Sharon Stone, on the other hand, is another story. For all of her glaring looks and her quiet would-be Clint Eastwood vocals, I just never bought her as a gunslinger-bad-ass like she is here. It's not that the part is poorly written (some of the lines of dialog could have been reworked, but such as a Western happens sometimes), but that she can't really carry the role well enough - not compared to everyone else around her, who fill in their roles (even DiCaprio) like it's nothing at all. It's forced work that soon becomes kind of boring, with the only slight saving grace being the final showdown gun battle between the hero and villain. The film might not have been truly great without her anyway, but she's really the one thing, for me, keeping it from being a true must-see rather than just a very fine curiosity.By a 'very fine curiosity' I mean that if you're hanging out on a Sunday night with your Dad (and you know the one, who loves Westerns so much he'll even forgive the crappy ones by John Wayne), possibly with a few brews, and Quick & Dead comes on TV, you should watch it. It's that kind of movie, and a interesting, if flawed, genre departure for Raimi.

It's that kind of movie, and a interesting, if flawed, genre departure for Raimi. ","genre":"Action, Thriller, Western"},{"date":"22 December 2009","score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" The Quick and the Dead is director Sam Raimi having a good time in his first non-horror\/action movie up to that time in his relatively young career (he was 34 or 35 when he directed this film). He looks at the Western and thinks, 'OK, let's throw in some Sergio Leone Spaghetti fun in here, from the opening ala Fistful of Dollars, and the main crux of the vengeance plot can have something to do with Once Upon a Time in the West- flashback included, of course.' While he thinks this, he's also still making the film his own in a lot of ways, notably in the gunfights. It's mostly a serious film though, not a dark comedy like Evil Dead or silly like Army of Darkness, even if there is a sense of subtle self-parody among some of the actors cast.Oh, a note about the cast this is one of the strangest but, on the whole, most effective ensembles of the 1990's. You've got everyone here you'd want to see in a guy movie from the time, with a few surprises Keith David, Lance Henrikson, Woody Strode (also from 'Once Upon a Time'), Russell Crowe, Leonardo DiCaprio (yes, back when he was, to the girls, 'Leo', here aka The Kid), Tobin Bell (yes, again, Jigsaw from Saw). But to top it off are two stars at the top of the bill (shared with Crowe and DiCaprio) that is a truly mixed bag. Both of the stars contribute, and take away, from the merits of the story, about a gunslinger competition that is more akin, to anything, of a Gladiatorial competition as it's to the death and run by a ruthless quasi-emperor (you can even see Crowe in a pre-Maximus role here as the Preacher).It's stars Gene Hackman and Sharon Stone that makes this compelling and curiously uninteresting at the same time. Hackman is one thing he's taking on a role that is far more actually evil (if not quite as scary in his humane way in Unforgiven), as the head of the town who strikes fear into everyone so much that you can feel the chill in the room in blazing hot weather. Hackman's delivery of the dialog is better than any other conceivable actor in the role, and he also is there in one of the movie's best scenes- maybe the one truly genius one all-around- where we see the first time that someone is shot rather gruesomely, and there's a slight pause from the onlookers, and then the most forced-polite applause ever seen. Watching Hackman alone is perhaps reason enough, even if you're not a Sam Raimi fan, to see Quick and the Dead.Sharon Stone, on the other hand, is another story. For all of her glaring looks and her quiet would-be Clint Eastwood vocals, I just never bought her as a gunslinger-bad-ass like she is here. It's not that the part is poorly written (some of the lines of dialog could have been reworked, but such as a Western happens sometimes), but that she can't really carry the role well enough - not compared to everyone else around her, who fill in their roles (even DiCaprio) like it's nothing at all.

The film in the middle? Well, it's the second-best. It's a little better than A Fistful of Dollars, but is still just on the level of being good.

While at first it was thought the immensity of these pictures was enough, at some point the studios felt the need to adapt and set off in search of the Holy Grail known as the intimate epic.To this end, it made sense for producer Sam Zimbalist to assign this project to director William Wyler, perhaps the finest director of human interaction who ever lived, but also one who was not afraid of big action scenes or outdoor vistas. Here Wyler shows a good handling of the Cinemascope canvas, making compositions with a lot of depth to them, which evens out and gives definition to the extreme width. He doesn't just do this with the massive sets, but also with the arrangements of people. For example when Messala comes to visit the Hur household, we see Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd in the foreground at opposite ends of the screen, and beyond them Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell slightly closer to screen centre. This creates a kind of perspective effect which draws the viewer in and focuses us on the actors.But a production of this size cannot be made on the efforts of its director alone. Wyler is backed up by a distinguished technical crew, and in fact perhaps Wyler's biggest contribution was how closely he seems to have worked with them, in particular cinematographer Robert Surtees. While the photography in Ben-Hur is rarely exquisite, it is extremely well-tailored to the moods and dramatic necessities of the picture. One of Wyler's trademarks was keeping to very selective angles, for example having an actor's back to the camera, or part of their face obscured behind a bit of scenery, so as only to show certain facets of their performance. Here he does not shoot with such stark variations, and mostly keeps the players in side-view mid-shots with long takes. However Surtees does a Wyler-type job with his lighting, for example keeping Haya Harareet's face well lit while her body is in darkness, capturing and emphasising her reactions, which are the best part of her performance, such as her shocked look when she is first kissed by Heston. For Heston himself, Surtees uses heavy contrast lighting, which makes the actor's face appear more expressive (and, I have to say, more handsome) than it actually is. Other than this, Surtees's biggest coup is his extraordinary nighttime photography which makes the nativity scene and the romantic meetings between Heston and Harareet truly outstanding.Other honourable mentions go to film editors Ralph Winters and John Dunning, and composer Miklos Rosza. It is the editing process which really makes the handful of action sequences work, especially that of Jack Hawkins urging the rowers to greater speeds, which is a delightfully intense montage of a kind rarely seen in classic-era Hollywood. Rosza's score is both stupendous and lavish, as his often were, utilizing some rather complex arrangements, with counter-melodies audible beneath the main themes. It's a score that can easily change moods to suit the scene, but also sounds authentic for the times being dealt with.Wyler and Zimbalist were sticklers for authenticity, and one example of this I am quite impressed with is that the nails go through Christ's wrists, not his palms, which is historically accurate. There is one rather glaring error though &#x96; the depiction of the lepers. 1959 was a good year for leprosy on screen, from the use of real victims in The Nun's Story to the awesomely nonsensical zombie-lepers in Fritz Lang's Indian diptych. However, according to the MGM makeup department, leprosy looks like a mild case of acne &#x96; rather an anticlimax after all the fuss made over it by the characters.The cast of Ben-Hur is frankly a bit of predictable box-ticking. People like Heston, Hawkins and Finlay Currie were an established part of ancient-world epic furniture, and the rest of the cast is filled by the usual assortment of respected theatre actors. Still, why complain when each is doing a good job? Heston is for once not the embarrassing lump of wood he normally was. His vocal delivery still leaves something to be desired but his emoting is spot on. Haya Harareet manages to stand out in what is a rather small role despite its being technically the female lead, and it is her contribution that makes the romantic angle work. I feel the Oscar for best supporting actor should have gone to Stephen Boyd and not Hugh Griffith. Boyd's performance is one of the more theatrical but it is also the most elaborate in that league &#x96; look at those tiny significant gestures he makes, such as a little rubbing of his thumb as he grasps Heston's arm in friendship. Admittedly though Griffith's lively appearance is very refreshing after the waves of pomposity, and I am faintly amused by the fact he sounds incredibly Welsh.So, were Zimbalist and Wyler successful in creating an intimate epic? No, not quite. They should have taken a tip from the recently-deceased Cecil B. DeMille. These ancient tales were so far removed from viewers' reality that any attempt at emotional sincerity was bound to fail, and the most entertaining epics are those that simply revel in their breathtaking grandiosity. Still, Ben-Hur contains much to enthral us, and in one respect shows the superiority of the vertically-integrated studio system. Although the system's glory days were over, the studios could still be trusted to bring together a tight and professional creative team who could all work towards the same goal. Perhaps the most poignant thing about Ben-Hur is that it is one of that system's final triumphs.

Still, why complain when each is doing a good job? Heston is for once not the embarrassing lump of wood he normally was. His vocal delivery still leaves something to be desired but his emoting is spot on. Haya Harareet manages to stand out in what is a rather small role despite its being technically the female lead, and it is her contribution that makes the romantic angle work. I feel the Oscar for best supporting actor should have gone to Stephen Boyd and not Hugh Griffith. Boyd's performance is one of the more theatrical but it is also the most elaborate in that league &#x96; look at those tiny significant gestures he makes, such as a little rubbing of his thumb as he grasps Heston's arm in friendship. Admittedly though Griffith's lively appearance is very refreshing after the waves of pomposity, and I am faintly amused by the fact he sounds incredibly Welsh.So, were Zimbalist and Wyler successful in creating an intimate epic? No, not quite. They should have taken a tip from the recently-deceased Cecil B. DeMille. These ancient tales were so far removed from viewers' reality that any attempt at emotional sincerity was bound to fail, and the most entertaining epics are those that simply revel in their breathtaking grandiosity. Still, Ben-Hur contains much to enthral us, and in one respect shows the superiority of the vertically-integrated studio system. Although the system's glory days were over, the studios could still be trusted to bring together a tight and professional creative team who could all work towards the same goal. Perhaps the most poignant thing about Ben-Hur is that it is one of that system's final triumphs.

Yes I've heard of them but I never actually bothered to watch them. But after I saw this movie it made me realise how entertaining and hysterical they are. It was just yesterday when I was watching a TV programme, I realised that this film was on next and it was then that I decided to watch it (just to not be bored.) I had my doubts about this film, not knowing what joy to expect because as I've said, I never seen any of the HA movies nor the prequel however I was able to catch on during the first 5 minutes of the film. Let me say I was throughly proved wrong during 5 or so minutes of the film. I half expected myself to switch to a different channel, never giving this film a chance as I felt that it was just going to be another boring Christmas movie. BUT, I was so overwhelmed by this film that I set off continuing to watch it...all the way through! I just loved it, I guess it just had that Christmasy spark and adventure. And let me say, it is very rare I would watch a film all the way to the end without even switching channels and feeling bored.The plot, I admit, was typical yet it had a really big impact on the film as it gave it its surreal adventure. I really enjoyed it but I believe it was utter coincidence that a kid could board on a plane, not knowing that his family was on another flight and finally they are separated all the way across the country. It would be terrifying for me as I do not know what I would do without my family...knowing they're not in the same country as I am and I was alone! But from the movies perspective, some good things came out of it (especially when you're in the city that never sleeps!) Room service, dining, luxurious suites, credit cards..aah! Kid's lucky! And also in this movie the kid acts so calm and independent and yet he's not at all scared that his family is halfway across the country! And speaking of being scared...how could you not be?? The mom + dad didn't look so worried when they soon found out that their kid is missing. Sure...despite the fact that the mom fainted, she didn't actually show any real worry! I was surprised that her and her husband was cracking up jokes in the police office when their son could be lost anywhere around the world...! And *psst;;;;spoiler;;;;* when the mom actually found her son, she wasn't even crying of joy! Finding your son in a big dangerous city would take a miracle (well, even though it's Christmas) and the mom was just like Ooh, I'm so glad to see you!... seriously! Speaking of being serious...the films climax was one HECK of a ride! The booby traps from the kid was very creative yet amazingly harsh!! I was expecting that the two bandits were to be killed at the end of the movie as they were heavily electrocuted (you SERIOUSLY could die), pelted with stone-hard bricks,(again!) attacked by a heard of pigeons and various nuts, bolts and hammers and fallen through spaces leading to another cruel booby trap (ouch!) and yet they didn't seem to break any part of their body -- let alone be killed!Yeah, so the booby traps were (like I said) harsh and the film makes it look like it's so easy to throw bricks at someone and know they'll be just okay... and not dead!... MY ADVICE Don't let your kids watch this, seriously acknowledge the PG rating!! But in spite of the silly action in the climax, I actually enjoyed the climax!! It was the best part in the movie and let me say it kept me on the edge of my seat! See that's the thing with Home Alone 2, the action just keeps your eyes glued to the screen! There were also some REALLY funny parts as well, like when Kevin was trying to escape from the hotel and of course, the ridiculous climax! (as I've already noted!)Pushing on to the characters, the relationship between Kevin and the pigeon lady was quite interesting. It just shows that Kevin was not alone and there was always a helping hand (which definitely came in use!*not saying any more, but you could probably work that out! sorry!*). Plus the scene where they had that talk, comprehending their feelings to one another was sweet, in comparison to the part when Kevin gave the lady a mini pigeon as a token of their friendship and saying I'll never forget you... What would make Home Alone 2 even better is if there were two stories. One of Kevin's New York Adventure and also one about the family trying to find him. Sure we definitely touched on Kevins' side but what about the family? It would sort of be good if the film was created into like a 'Finding Nemo' type story (but NOT a big drama!) so we would have both adventures...Overall it comes down to Home Alone 2 to being THE Christmas movie! I genuinely loved it, it was sweet, funny and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. But seriously if you're watching this film with young kids, watch out for the climax! But other than that, I would definitely recommend it!*********\/10 stars!!!Merry Christmas and a happy new year, everyone! ~Karl D ","genre":null},{"date":"22 December 2009","score":"","review":" I've never been much of a fan of the HA movies.

","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Family"},{"date":"22 December 2009","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" The fourth and penultimate film in the series, Conquest represents a major change in tone from its relatively light-hearted predecessor, Escape from the Planet of the Apes. This is notable as being the first film not to feature either any characters from the original film or characters created by Pierre Boulle. This time around, the focus is on Caesar, the now fully grown son of the talking chimpanzees from the future, Cornelius and Zira, who appeared in the previous three films. Like his father, Caesar is played by the good luck charm of the Apes franchise, the frequently underrated Roddy McDowall.Taking place in the then near future of 1991, Caesar is brought into the city - which city is never specified - by his human foster father Armando, played extremely well by Richardo Montalban. Now about 18 years old, Caesar has seemingly lead a relatively sheltered life under the watchful and caring hand of Armando and has spent much of that time as a performer in Armando's circus, now an outdated form of entertainment. Caesar is told by Armando that in 1983, an astronaut brought a virus back with him from space and, as a result, every dog and cat in the world died within months. It was soon discovered that apes, like their human cousins, were immune to the virus and were consequently taken as pets in the years that followed. Over time, it became clear that apes could be taught to perform household chores and manual labour, meaning that they turned from pets into slaves. Outraged by his kind's plight, Caesar begins to plot a revolution to teach humanity a lesson.In terms of the effectiveness of its social commentary, Conquest is probably second only to the original film. It has very interesting things to say about humanity and the way in which we treat our kind. The apes are essentially a stand in for each and every race of people who have been oppressed or enslaved throughout history, most obviously African-American slaves in the United States and, before that, British North America. The mistreatment, to put it mildly, of the apes at the hands of the humans is deliberately intended to bring to mind that of the slaves in the Antebellum United States. This is exemplified by the presence of Mr. McDonald, played by Hari Rhodes, the one sympathetic human character other than Armando. Unlike many of his fellow humans, he sympathises with the apes' plight which is perhaps unsurprising given that he himself is African-American.As with the previous three films, Conquest has a strong villain in the form of Governor Breck, as played by Don Murray. Like Escape's Dr. Hasslein, Breck has shades of Dr. Zaius about him and is as determined to eliminate the threat posed to the future of his civilisation as Dr. Zaius was in the first film. Murray turns in an excellent performance, with the exception of one or two hammy line deliveries towards the end of the film but that's a minor quibble. Watching Murray's performance, I couldn't help but be reminded of Hitler, which was no doubt screen writer Paul Dehn's intention. The fact that the security forces dress in black uniforms similar to those of the SS certainly reinforced the Nazi analogy. Incidentally, the political system of the United States in this fictional version of 1991 is never explained but it certainly appears to be a controlled society though perhaps not a dictatorship in the true sense of the word. With the exception of Murray, Rhodes and Montalban, the supporting cast of Conquest is not as strong as in previous entries but McDowall more than makes up for this with a fantastic performance as Caesar, the young, passionate and some might say idealistic ape embittered by the fate of his parents and the plight of his people at the hands of the U.S. government.

This is notable as being the first film not to feature either any characters from the original film or characters created by Pierre Boulle. This time around, the focus is on Caesar, the now fully grown son of the talking chimpanzees from the future, Cornelius and Zira, who appeared in the previous three films. Like his father, Caesar is played by the good luck charm of the Apes franchise, the frequently underrated Roddy McDowall.Taking place in the then near future of 1991, Caesar is brought into the city - which city is never specified - by his human foster father Armando, played extremely well by Richardo Montalban. Now about 18 years old, Caesar has seemingly lead a relatively sheltered life under the watchful and caring hand of Armando and has spent much of that time as a performer in Armando's circus, now an outdated form of entertainment. Caesar is told by Armando that in 1983, an astronaut brought a virus back with him from space and, as a result, every dog and cat in the world died within months. It was soon discovered that apes, like their human cousins, were immune to the virus and were consequently taken as pets in the years that followed. Over time, it became clear that apes could be taught to perform household chores and manual labour, meaning that they turned from pets into slaves. Outraged by his kind's plight, Caesar begins to plot a revolution to teach humanity a lesson.In terms of the effectiveness of its social commentary, Conquest is probably second only to the original film. It has very interesting things to say about humanity and the way in which we treat our kind. The apes are essentially a stand in for each and every race of people who have been oppressed or enslaved throughout history, most obviously African-American slaves in the United States and, before that, British North America. The mistreatment, to put it mildly, of the apes at the hands of the humans is deliberately intended to bring to mind that of the slaves in the Antebellum United States. This is exemplified by the presence of Mr. McDonald, played by Hari Rhodes, the one sympathetic human character other than Armando. Unlike many of his fellow humans, he sympathises with the apes' plight which is perhaps unsurprising given that he himself is African-American.As with the previous three films, Conquest has a strong villain in the form of Governor Breck, as played by Don Murray. Like Escape's Dr. Hasslein, Breck has shades of Dr. Zaius about him and is as determined to eliminate the threat posed to the future of his civilisation as Dr. Zaius was in the first film. Murray turns in an excellent performance, with the exception of one or two hammy line deliveries towards the end of the film but that's a minor quibble. Watching Murray's performance, I couldn't help but be reminded of Hitler, which was no doubt screen writer Paul Dehn's intention. The fact that the security forces dress in black uniforms similar to those of the SS certainly reinforced the Nazi analogy. Incidentally, the political system of the United States in this fictional version of 1991 is never explained but it certainly appears to be a controlled society though perhaps not a dictatorship in the true sense of the word. With the exception of Murray, Rhodes and Montalban, the supporting cast of Conquest is not as strong as in previous entries but McDowall more than makes up for this with a fantastic performance as Caesar, the young, passionate and some might say idealistic ape embittered by the fate of his parents and the plight of his people at the hands of the U.S. government.

The best way to make a courtroom drama dramatic is to heap as much evidence up against the defendant that the viewer is rooting for, and that's all they done here (to the maximum).The vigilante murder by the grieving father was just a catalyst and the courtroom was just the setting. They were just tools used to drive the message of the film, which is pretty much summed up in lawyer Jake Brigance's (Matthew McConaughey) final speech when he says, now imagine the girl is white. The film, like some reviewers seem to be saying, is not implying that the white jury are inherently racist against black people and that they'd be more horrified by a white girl being raped than a black girl. What it's saying is that the jury would maybe sympathise or relate (and I use these terms loosely) to it happening to a white girl as they would be able to picture it more as if it were their own daughter who had been violated, rather than a poor black girl of a crazy (enter racial slur here___).To support this, Carl's little pre-judgement day talk to Brigance lies at the heart of this final speech when Carl tells Brigance in his prison cell that through no fault of anybodies, they have been divided as white and black, that they are from different neighbourhoods and that their kids won't ever play together. In a sense this would have been true, especially if you take into account the time the film was supposed to be it set. The whole point was explicitly verbalised to the viewer when Carl asks Brigance to make the jury see through his eyes, or in a more literal sense befitting the film, through his heart and that's what he did. Don't rip this film apart for being illogical to facts or irresponsible, because it is obviously not claiming to be. Having said that, we shouldn't forget that in his final speech, Brigance did tell the jury that the psych doctor (who gave evidence in support of Carl) who was charged with statutory rape in his past, had actually been innocent as the girl was 17, on top of which he married her and had kids with her. This would make him not a felon and his statement that Carl was insane at the time he committed the murder entirely credible. So who knows, maybe the jury agreed Carl was insane and acquitted him based on that alone. In any case, it is made clear that this is an emotional drama that seeks a truth that sometimes real logical justice does not provide. It deals with heavy subject matter such as racism because racism hurts people emotionally and so is a perfect way or pulling the audience in, and if it's done its job then you should have shed a few tears (or more) at the conclusion of it.

This sums up his philosophical view.By detaching himself from the mundane drudgery of earthly life, avoiding ugly competitiveness, cut-throat jealousy, greed and hatred in human society he reaches a Utopia of his own. In this sense, he is almost non-human. He is a Taoist who lives in harmony with nature, who interacts only with creatures born and bred in nature.

Instead, he finds that the mean streets of New York aren't as inviting as he hoped. However, he does manage to hatch an unlikely friendship with a streetwise lowlife (Dustin Hoffman) who's doing just as poorly as he is. Amid the struggle to attain their dreams of living the good life the two form a bond akin to brotherhood.The acting is perhaps the film's strength, with both Jon Voight & Dustin Hoffman being rewarded with Oscar nominations for their convincing, compassionate portrayals of outcasts. Sylvia Miles also received an Oscar nomination for her small role. There's little else worth remarking on but keep an eye out for Bob Balaban in his film debut.The film's Oscar for adapted screenplay reflects the story's emotional impact but I expect that it also got extra credit for tackling taboo subject matter. Nowadays, of course, this sort of thing is less remarkable but the story is still good, if not as great as it's reputation suggests.The Oscar-winning direction by Schlesinger is well handled but sometimes goes overboard with stylization. Some of the visuals are very 'of their time'. The music, on the other hand, is one of the most memorable aspects of the film. Harry Nilsson's Everybody's Talking' is classic and the rest of the music fits the film nicely.Ultimately, I think that Midnight Cowboy is worth viewing but I have some reservations. Barring the late stages of the film I find the story somewhat aimless & uninvolving. Granted, the film was undeniably daring for the time, but I think that it gets too much credit for this. That being said, there are nevertheless parts of the film that are worthy of classic status.

She sneaks and travels to New York, where she meets him lodged with the identity of John Brown. Dr. Constance decides to heal him recovering his memory and discover the fate of the true Dr. Anthony Edwardes.Spellbound is far from being among my favorite Hitchcock's movies, but there is at least one unforgettable moment in this suspenseful but dull romance the sequence of John Ballantine's dream based on designs of Salvador Dali. Ingrid Bergman performs a psychoanalyst vulnerable in many moments and with unacceptable attitudes, like for example, prioritizing to open her correspondence that giving attention to her mentally ill patient Mr. Garmes or her juvenile rapture with Gregory Peck's character.
