Twin Peaks was a show that found an audience, but most others had nothing to do with it. The same is true with this movie. Fans, or some of them, should love this, but people who are not supporters of David Lynch or the series should avoid this one. The final week of Laura Palmer's (Sheryl Lee) life is shown in this production which acts as a prequel to the stunning series. Ray Wise, who was always the best actor in the series, is definitely solid here as Laura's father. The movie is dark and highly disturbing as prostitution, under-aged sexual situations, Canadian drug-smuggling and abuse, whacked dream sequences and that odd cherry pie are all prevalent tools used by Lynch here. The haunting score and the cast from the series make stunning returns. Many supporters of the program rubbish Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me saying that Lynch ignored too many characters and got away from the quirkiness that made the series so popular in some circles. For me, the film goes well with the series and Lynch's innovative film-making makes the movie a success overall. Not for all tastes, but most definitely interesting like the short-lived television series. 4 stars out of 5.

Shane is dissatisfied with his homelife, as young male movie protagonists are wont to be, so he decides to work in the New York club everyone is raving about - 'Studio 54'. Getting in on the salacious looks of 54's boss, Steve Rubell (Mike Myers), Shane gets to meet a variety of people and experience a life of new excesses, which will shape his whole life - because it would be a boring movie if they did not.Right the problem with '54' is that. well we never get much of a feel for the titular place. '54' was, apparently, a place of hedonism, of pushing the boundaries of pleasure and so forth - the movie instead presents us with a slightly risqué club, but nothing shocking or, more pointedly, memorable about it. Yes there're drugs - ohhh! Scary! Yes sex occurs - but in a low-key tame manner. Yes there's some glitz in the club - but hardly anything spectacular. So the quintessential heart of the movie isn't really beating - it's up to the characters to try and keep the body pumping. Unfortunately, with one exception, they're all rather dull. Shsne doesn't really do much except Fall For Girl Who He Should Not Fall For - a stock plot device that's tired. He forms a few friendships but they're never all that convincing. Is this a fault of Phillipe? Probably not because he can rise above being a very very pretty face (which is what he's in this movie for). His friend, Greg (Breckin Meyer), is dull and Greg's girlfriend Anita (Selma Hayek in an unworthy performance), is - in her thin sketchedness - a perfect companion. It's only Myers performance as Rubell that we see an actual character forming - this being clearly Myers' best performance, with a great touch of eternal sadness invested into the character that allows him to command the movie any time he is on screen.Written and directed by Mark Christopher, this movie was apparently not what the director originally intended. Certainly there doesn't seem to be much of a vision here, as the movie ambles along to a somewhat obvious and certainly bland conclusion (admittedly, being based on fact it had no choice - that doesn't mean we have to be bored on the journey). There's nothing stand out about any of Christopher's work here. it doesn't really show any spirit but it's certainly no `Battlefield Earth'. Perhaps if his original picture was intact - which purported to really give us a flavour of '54'  and the people - then this movie would be decent.

However, this fresh little charmer should be given more than just a fair shot. Sour disappointments like Attack of the Clones and Undercover Brother pale in comparison in many themes and elements to this bouncy, giddy movie.Last year was a very good year for computer generated animated movies. For me, though, only Shrek wowed me. Monsters, Inc. was a good if fluffy entry from Pixar. Ice Age was also amusing but left a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth. And I don't even want to know about Final Fantasy. This year, it seems that low budget traditionally animated movie reign supreme. Two appear to be duds. Hey Arnold the Movie looks like very cheap, rank garbage. I'll reserve judgement on Spirit, but needless to say I won't be rushing out to see it until it's available for rent at a video store. Then along came Lilo and Stitch, and I was overjoyed. Never before have I felt so alive watching an animated movie. Now add this movie to the good pile. It's not Lilo and Stitch, but anybody who thinks that it's trying to be needs to have their brain re-wired.Granted, you need to be a fan of the series to enjoy the movie. Or at the very least, you have to be open-minded and willing to check out what all the fuss is about. No doubt many critics will pick at the movie's cheap animation. If you're looking for Disney style brilliance, watch another movie. The Powerpuff Girls has its own brand of style that I still find to be superior to flatly drawn, pandering animated movies like much of Don Bluth and fare like Ferngully. Unlike all of the other cartoons-turned-big-screen movies, The Powerpuff Girls is actually fun to look at. Many scenes are positively magical, some where the animation becomes more fluid than usual to suit the need, others that are a dizzying array of exciting camera angles and colors. In fact this movie is so hyperactive, you'll either go WOW! or What?The scripting is a hundred times more well thought out than any of its cartoon based movies counterparts that came before, whether it's Transformers, Pokemon, or Winnie the Pooh with The Tigger Movie. The Powerpuff Girls is smooth and clean and never overstays its welcome. There are no cliches, no plot points that seem weird, no sudden changes in pacing and direction that plague many animated and live action movies. The characters are oddly endearing, and there are many moments of warmth and just feeling good. The relationship between the professor and the girls is strangely touching. Other moments are genuinely shocking, heartbreaking, and dramatic in a light kind of way. The climax is suitably ridiculous, with bad puns galore, but there is no shortage of excitement. There is also a running gag in this movie that is quite unexpected. Yet ultimately what makes this movie shine is what's buried beneath this cream puff movie, a message about accepting the gifts that make one special and unique as well as the importance of showing love to those that are shunned and deemed freaks.Fans of the series will notice that this movie is not as zany as most of the series' episodes or many of Disney's movies. Yet The Powerpuff Girls was a welcome surprise that I was initially wary of. It is a fresh, light-hearted, bouncy break from the mess that is 2002 and is quite the refreshing change from modern Disney. Go ahead and see Men in Black 2 if you want, but I, personally, would wait until Two Towers came out and skip everything else in favor of Lilo and Stitch and this movie. No, The Powerpuff Girls isn't going to floor you.

They say she decapitated a man. Laurie is all beat up, dirty, and basically in bad shape knowing her brother, THE SHAPE, is coming for her again. We find out that the man whose head was chopped off was really a paramedic who had his larynx crushed by Michael before they got to Laurie. Back at the sanitarium, she sets a trap for him in her room. She puts a fake her inside her bed and when Michael gets to the dummy, Laurie hits him with a lamp and shocks him a little bit. She hides and sends him up to the roof, her following. She says some strong dialog (rewritten since the internet draft) about how he has failed (although not said, she gives you the idea). He is lifted by his ankle upside down with this crane thing. He drops his knife. Laurie picks up the knife and goes to unmask her, to make sure it really is Michael. He grabs her and brings her off the side of the building. Michael's knife goes into her gut in the process. She does something really sweet before Michael pulls the knife out and she falls into some trees below (really cool shot) and then Michael does a really shameful thing. Now we're at the Haddonfield University where we meet our six main characters, Bill, Jim, Rudy, Jen, Donna, and Sara, who are six teens who are going to go into the Myer's house for a internet thing with Dangertainment, entrepeneur Freddie Harris' company, along with his assistant, Nora Winston. Halloween arrives as they explore the house. They all have mixed opinions about the house, but they can't leave till the next morning, and they get scholarships for doing this. That night, after we get to know more about our characters, Freddie plans some Michael Myers fun, with his own costume and mask. When the real Michael Myers shows up and everyone sees both of them, something really funny happens. The real Myers begins to kill most of them, and only a few get out alive. When Sara escapes to a shed outside, she cuts some electrical wires and cases a big fire around the Myer's house. Myer's gets tangled up in some electrical wires. I'm not going to spoil the ending, so go see the move. It's one of the best Halloween films ever (although there are some points they could have worked on a little stronger), and anyone, even those who haven't seen any other Halloween movies should see this (they explain most things in the opening monologue over the credits).

When I got my hands on a VHS copy of Lion King, a preview contained an ad for the 33rd Disney animated movie, Pocahontas.  I skipped it in theatres, as it looked very bland and unappealing.  My family and I chose to see Batman Forever instead (we must have seen it three times theatrically...^_^).  I waited to see it come out on video.  But, still, I didn't rent it, until my local Family Video opened up (free kids movies! ^^).  Finally, I checked it out to see it for myself.It was no good.  Aside from the bad press it got due to its 'romancization' of a real life historical event (Pocahontas was ten when she saved John Smith's life, and before that, Pocahontas and Smith had never met.  That, and the real John Smith was no hero) it's really a 16th century retelling of Romeo and Juliet.  It's based on fiction, not history.  If you wish to write a report on the life of Pocahontas, don't credit this movie. Compared to the other four animated Disney films mentioned in this review, the artistic style is very minimalist.  Here, the characters and backgrounds are just flat, and rather unengaging.  The designs are very plain, and very boring.  It lacks a strong, colorful villain, too.

The only songs in Pocahontas I enjoyed were Colors of the Wind (by Vanessa Williams) and If I Never Knew You (both in the closing credits).  Only the antics of Meeko (Pocahontas' pet raccoon) made the movie more worthwhile.  As Cylex states, he's the real star (if he's still a little plain).  Flit and Percy are a bit perfunctory, little more than foils for Meeko.  Without him, this film would've been junk.  I felt the ending was a bit weak.  *spoiler alert* It would have been nice to see Pocahontas travel to England, as she did in real life.  But, no such luck. *end spoilers*My verdict is that I cannot recommend Pocahontas.  In short, the entire movie just felt lazy.  It is an extreme disappointment, especially considering this is the follow-up to Disney's immortal The Lion King.

The only songs in Pocahontas I enjoyed were Colors of the Wind (by Vanessa Williams) and If I Never Knew You (both in the closing credits).  Only the antics of Meeko (Pocahontas' pet raccoon) made the movie more worthwhile.  As Cylex states, he's the real star (if he's still a little plain).  Flit and Percy are a bit perfunctory, little more than foils for Meeko.  Without him, this film would've been junk.  I felt the ending was a bit weak.  *spoiler alert* It would have been nice to see Pocahontas travel to England, as she did in real life.  But, no such luck. *end spoilers*My verdict is that I cannot recommend Pocahontas.  In short, the entire movie just felt lazy.  It is an extreme disappointment, especially considering this is the follow-up to Disney's immortal The Lion King.  I guess after making four back-to-back masterpieces, a disappointment was bound to happen sometime.  u_u ","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"4 July 2002","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  I had the feeling that Gladiator uses its plot primarily to show brutal gladiator fights.

Whether or not you're a transfan or not, it's still rather entertaining. 10\/10 ","genre":"Animation, Action, Adventure"},{"date":"4 July 2002","score":"","review":"  I wasn't a big Matt Damon fan but I am now.  I liked The Talented Mr. Ripley and went to see it because of Paltrow and Jude Law but I walked away from it liking Damon too.Now with The Bourne Identity Damon has definitely found a great role and he plays it very well.  Geez, I was blown away by the quickness of the film. It seemed to pick me up soon after sitting down in the theater and took me for a fine ride.  No gratuitous sex or silly love story-ness to get in the way just good old thrills, mystery, action and outright fun.  I LOVE a movie that makes you jump out of your seat and when the whole audience does it several times you know the movie is good.I HIGHLY recommend you see this movie.  The car chase scene throughout the streets of Paris is amazing -  no hills like there were in McQueen's Bullit but some fancy car dancing that was a thrill a minute.Go see it!
