Please don't misinterpret my comments about Mr. King. Indisputably, King has a knack for knitting gripping horror yarns, but the warp factor in this fiction dilutes any satisfaction lately that his endings furnish. The twisted nature of good and evil that permeates his plots makes them as lurid as gory car accidents. You don't so much read Stephen King to enjoy a catharsis as you do to experience necrophobia.Frank Darabont made his Hollywood feature film debut five years ago as the director of The Shawshank Redemption. Derived from a King novella, The Shawshank Redemption became one of the top-grossing films of 1994, surpassing even Pulp Fiction! When I saw The Shawshank Redemption and later raved about it, little did I know that King had a claw in it. Incredibly, Darabont performed a miracle on Shawshank and King. Not only did he make it palatable, but he also created a classic with a dramatically satisfying resolution. The good guys triumphed, and the bad guys got what they justly deserved! A Stephen King movie that neither grossed me out nor cheated me is an exercise in rare artistry.Although The Green Mile shares similarities with The Shawshank Redemption, the former falls short of the latter. A prison serves as the setting for each movie, and a black man and a white guy form a close relationship. Each film explores the themes of good and evil and the fragility of the human condition. Unlike the thoughtfully-paced and trimly-crafted Shawshank, Darabont wallows indulgently in King's source material. King readers will applaud the reverence that Darabont lavishes on the literary master of the macabre. Nevertheless, The Green Mile is a lemon that wears out its welcome long before it ends. Despite a terrific cast and its atmospheric production values, The Green Mile is far too long, far too loquacious, and far too morbid. While this death row drama succeeds as an above-average character study, The Green Mile could have been improved had Darabont left half of it on the cutting room floor.Not only did Darabont direct The Green Mile, but he also penned the screenplay. Unimaginatively, he drags out everything ad nauseam. The Green Mile clocks in at an appalling 187 minutes! Moreover, those three hours and seven minutes lack velocity. The initial 45 minutes elapse without complication, but the remaining 142 minutes lurch about in fits and starts. You'll be checking your watch at the two hour mark and wondering why the film has not made greater progress. Darabont dramatizes so much questionable material that he doesn't have time to accelerate either the momentum or urgency.Eventually, the shopworn plotting degenerates so much that you want to fast forward through those scenes that clog up the action. Darabont seems lost himself. The Green Mile circles rather than moves in a straight line. He resorts to standard symbolic clichés, such as John Coffey's initials. Moreover, Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan of Armageddon) acts a Christ figure of sorts, because he was unfairly imprisoned for crimes he did not commit. When Coffey heals one guard and resurrects an animal, the comparison between Christ and Coffy is blatant. Movie rule #1 Animals must never die! Later, Coffey passes along part of his powers to Edgcomb whose first name was Paul. Catch the religious significance? The realism clashes unevenly with the fantasy. The Hogan's Heroes antics are entertaining, but too much time is wasted on other characters that add nothing to the plot. Darabont directs as if he were watching a mini-series.Indeed, The Green Mile boasts some powerfully emotional scenes, but the misguided scenes outnumber them. While confined largely to death row, The Green Mile sprawls with considerable ethos, passion, and scope. Darabont weaves elements from Birdman of Alcatraz (1962), Powder (1995), and E.T The Extraterrestrial (1982). Darabont relates the story in one marathon flashback. Since Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks of Forrest Gump) never faces death, the flashback proves an acceptable storytelling device rather than anti-climactic, as it would be in lesser films where the hero appears in constant jeopardy. Edgecomb lives in a retirement home when we see him at first. He attends a screening of the Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers' musical Top Hat (1935) in the facility. The memories that Top Hat triggers sends Edgecomb out of the room in tears. A lady friend rushes to Paul's side, and he regales her with his exploits as a prison guard in the 1930s.Characters with depth and strength walk The Green Mile. The action unfolds during the Great Depression in 1935 at Louisiana's Cold Mountain Prison where a gigantic Of Mice and Men type African-American itinerant receives the death penalty for killing two little white girls. As the Chief of Guards on Death Row, Paul Edgecomb treats the inmates with respect and dignity. He supervises the arrival of John Coffey in E-Block. Coffey towers like Goliath over Edgecomb and his crew of guards, and he has to bend over to enter his cell. During Coffey's sojourn at Cold Mountain, Edgecomb discovers the miracles can occur in the most unlikely places.Sadly, the unsavory moments in The Green Mile sabotage the memorable ones. Occasionally, you may even feel a mite green around the gills. The squeamish should look the other way during the electrocution scenes, especially when Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter of True Crime) dies in the chair. Of course, no American movie about life-behind-bars could resist commentary on capital punishment. Indeed, prison movies often qualify as thinly-veiled polemics against the death penalty. Clearly, the people at Warner Brothers who made The Green Mile deplore the death penalty, but they relish poetic justice. At the last minute, The Green Mile wades a little too deeply into the philosophical quagmire with its revelations about the protagonist. Altogether, the audience doesn't get any time off for good behavior.

Sara Goldfarb, a TV-loving widow who is addicted to diet pills, her heroin-addict son Harry Goldfarb, his coke-addicted girlfriend, Marion Silver, and his drug-dealing friend, Tyrone Love.You learn a lot about each character and begin to sympathize with their situation as they begin to spiral downward with their addictions.Ellen Burstyn was excellent in The Exorcist, so I knew she would give a good performance as Sara Goldfarb. I had never seen Jared Leto in other movies, but he sure didn't disappoint here as Harry Goldfarb. Marlon Wayans is usually in bad, over-the-top comedies, so I was really surprised with his excellent performance as Tyrone Love. I personally do not care for Jennifer Connelly, she wasn't bad as Marion though, just wasn't great either. And Christopher McDonald was perfect as Tappy Tibbons, the icon of Sara's TV addiction, who runs a talk-show talking about how he managed to lose weight and gain his life back.This movie wasn't perfect, but was still great. It claws into your senses and burrows in deep, making you really get the full-blast of what this movie is trying to tell you.

I had like a prejudice, I considered the Academy Award for best picture of Rocky to be just one of the many jokes that the Academy has made and not particularly funny jokes. Taxi Driver is one of my all time favourites so you can imagine the rest. Now after watching finally Rocky I still believe its Oscar is a big joke however is easy to see why it won and easy to say that the Academy Awards are just a big piece of s***. Before you stop reading my comment I will write that I do like this film and truly a lot. I had a lot of fun by watching this with a couple of friends. It is definitely a film with a lot of memorable stuff that everybody knows, many famous sequences and that music theme. I love how it begins but essentially nothing really happens we just watch Rocky in his daily routine; boxing is just one way to get some dollars but not any more a possible way to have something bigger in life. In short, Rocky is not any more thinking just in boxing, he has to get money of course and he uses his strength for other little jobs for Gazzo (Joe Spineli). On the other hand we meet a present star of boxing, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) but actually we meet him not as the boxer but more as the businessman that sees beyond the sport. Sure he is the champion and when he sees the chance to be not only a great boxer but also a patriot. He sees the chance to show why America is the land of opportunity and, of course, he don't think twice in order to make a decision. Now he is the Uncle Sam and he will give the opportunity of his life to a working class Italian, American with that Apollo Creed will be the hero, the champion, the spectacle, the star, etc. However he is not a likable character at all mostly because almost we never watch him as the boxer. Of course Rocky is that Italian American, the Italian Stallion who doesn't even imagine what his nickname will make, yes he will find finally some luck and for sure I won't miss the chance. But it is not just boxing, actually during the entire 120 minutes of the film we only watch a couple of fights of Rocky; is also a love story that is even quite funny. Funny because you watch how people change for love, one day Adrian (Taila Shire) wears glasses and the other day she doesn't need glasses any more! Rocky changed her a lot and on that way he is my f****** idol (first date first kiss and she was an extremely shy girl!). The brother of Adrian (Burt Young) is always following Rocky and always repeating the same things to the Italian Stallion, thanks to that he is another funny character of the film but there are many repetitive dialogs during it that I found extremely fun to watch. Do you know who is Julio Cesar Chavez? Well if you don't he was a great Mexican boxer and recently he worked as commentator of TV for the Olympic boxing. I saw a fight of one Mexican who, unfortunately, was beaten but it was absolute fun hearing Chavez. He said that the Mexican loose the fight because no quebro la cintura (he doesn't bend at the waist) and the fun thing was that he repeated that like 10 times during the fight! It was really funny and during this film we have some similar situations. The one that made me remember Chavez was the conversation of Rocky with Mickey (Burgess Meredith), he repeats a lot that Rocky will need a trainer. Of course these two will have finally a special friendship and here the real training begins so the memorable sequences begins. A boxer who wanted to make a real fight against the star, he did that but&#133;I like this film a lot but I just don't found in it the masterpiece and inspirational piece of cinema that many found. The first Rocky is a lot of fun with that mentioned memorable stuff. Are you talking to me? Is curious to hear Rocky saying that.

Joel Schumacher is responsible for Batman & Robin, one of the most horrendously made movies in the past 15 years. One could have said upon leaving the theater in 1997 that Joel Schumacher is one of the worst directors working today. Two years later, Schumacher creates something, albeit with commercial sensibilities, that succeeds on many levels. 8mm is a murky, scuzzy passage through the miserable, dystopian criminal world of snuff films, taken on by a private investigator who is dismayed and scarred by what he unearths. It probes the resources of violent exploitation films, but not as a violent exploitation film. It would more accurately turn your stomach than amuse. Andrew Kevin Walker, who wrote Seven, and again establishes a protagonist who confronts evil and nearly loses his sanity in an effort to understand its reasons. The answer comes almost at the end of the film, from its most vicious character, but his rationale wittingly refrains from going as deep as the psychological world of his deeds. Joel Schumacher has an attraction to sinister, perhaps Gothic environments, even if his previous films that follow that pattern aren't so great, like The Lost Boys. Here, with Mychael Danna's sorrowful score and the great Robert Elswit's guilty, peeping camera, he fashions an impression of apprehension even in the few scenes where the story takes solace in Cage's home life. One director would not be wrong to shock us with a comparison to the unsuspecting atmosphere of Cage's residential street or the opening airport shot, but Schumacher perceives the looming subterranean goings-on beneath the unsuspecting.The intent of the story is to consider a rather everyday individual and provoke him into such a troubling conflict with pure evil that he himself is pushed to torture and murder. He lives an unexciting but mostly happy life with his wife Catherine Keener and their infant daughter. He went to a good school on an academic scholarship, however while his contemporaries went through the most conventional motions to become lawyers, doctors, bankers, he chose a line of work comprised of following, shadowing, investigating, staking out, watching. For the sake of a comfortable living, he accommodates an upper crust circle of socialites and politicians. Nevertheless, this case which he almost does not take is unique. He is sent for by the attorney of a rich widow whose husband has just died. Whilst rummaging through the inside of her husband's safe, she and the lawyer find an 8 mm film of what seems to be the vicious slaying of a teenage girl by a large masked man. Cage convinces himself that the film, while horrifying, is simulation, but the widow wants him to confirm this for sure.8mm doesn't consider the story's dilemmas merely as opportunity for money-making set pieces like action scenes. When Cage has the chance to take revenge, he doesn't have the command of his motivation because he does not have the same capacity for murder that his prospective victims have, and he essentially calls a character wounded by this person and provokes her to talk him into it. That is a novel approach the protagonist's vengeful turning point, and it elicits subliminal moral uncertainty that the audience has to take in hand.8mm is a conventional studio thriller, but it is a real movie. It is all content and the suitable approach to that content. It is about human's aptitude for malevolence, conjecturing just deep it can go and how little we care to know of it in ourselves.

Joel Schumacher is responsible for Batman & Robin, one of the most horrendously made movies in the past 15 years. One could have said upon leaving the theater in 1997 that Joel Schumacher is one of the worst directors working today. Two years later, Schumacher creates something, albeit with commercial sensibilities, that succeeds on many levels. 8mm is a murky, scuzzy passage through the miserable, dystopian criminal world of snuff films, taken on by a private investigator who is dismayed and scarred by what he unearths. It probes the resources of violent exploitation films, but not as a violent exploitation film. It would more accurately turn your stomach than amuse. Andrew Kevin Walker, who wrote Seven, and again establishes a protagonist who confronts evil and nearly loses his sanity in an effort to understand its reasons. The answer comes almost at the end of the film, from its most vicious character, but his rationale wittingly refrains from going as deep as the psychological world of his deeds. Joel Schumacher has an attraction to sinister, perhaps Gothic environments, even if his previous films that follow that pattern aren't so great, like The Lost Boys. Here, with Mychael Danna's sorrowful score and the great Robert Elswit's guilty, peeping camera, he fashions an impression of apprehension even in the few scenes where the story takes solace in Cage's home life.

The death of film is a tragic thing, but I will be grateful for the day when that great medium is no longer tainted and insulted by endless contemporary tripe such as this.I heard about this movie because I was talking to a friend about Death at a Funeral and somehow he'd not heard of that one--but boy, had he heard about Four Weddings and a Funeral. And one after another people started asking me if I'd seen the latter--and insisting that I MUST!But, why?? Why, why, why, why, WHY??Warning do not go in expecting anything like Death at a Funeral or you will be deeply sorry. There are some incredible differences here1. Death had impeccable black comedy timing from start to finish. All of the funny scenes in Four Weddings revolve around minor characters, all of whom were primarily centered around the second wedding the desperate bridesmaid-turned-bride, her even more desperate suitor, and the newly-ordained Roman Catholic priest Father Gerald to whom falls the unfortunate task of marrying them--but while his liturgical blunders were amusing enough, by the time he got to the end of the Rite and was still screwing up every other word, I was ready to say, Okay, Monsieur l'Abbé, let's move it along, now! And I'm not sure I laughed once after the second reception was over. The funeral was just cheesy, and totally unnecessary--but actually, the entire film was unnecessary, so that's a petty complaint.2. Death had a coherent, engaging plot from start to finish. Four Weddings does not. The excuse, I know, will be that the story was not plot-driven but character-driven, but more on that below.3. The characters in Death were all real people, and all of them--even the shallow, marketable, jet-setting Gotham-dwelling novelist--burn their dignity at the stake for the sake of those they love. For a black comedy, it was surprisingly inspirational. But the characters in Four Weddings? Insipid, unsympathetic, promiscuous and totally implausible. A grown man lives in a flat with a young girl--and there's no scandal there?? A group of friends that seems never to have left high school? The obligatory queer couple that must factor into every romantic montage in the P.C. post-modern cinema?Charles starts out somewhat sympathetically, a seemingly nice and reserved young man who just can't seem to commit... but gradually we learn WHY he can't commit, and it's not pretty. (Also... Hugh Grant cannot act.) And Carrie? She had to be lying when she claims she's jumped over thirty men. How on Earth could anyone sleep with her once, let alone fall in love with her? From the minute I saw her at the first wedding I could see she had b**** written all over her. (Also... if I thought GRANT couldn't act...)4. Death was a showcase of amazing British dramatic talent. The actors in Four Weddings are pathetic, mostly because of the lame story they have to work with. (The aforementioned three minor characters are the exceptions.) Clearly, the casting of Andie MacDowell was deliberately done to drive home an anti-American theme, and it worked quite well. I relish the scene where she says, As for the rest of you (i.e., the British in the room), I'd have thought that lots of frightful Americans flying in was an excuse for staying away, so I thank you, too. You're not welcome, sweetheart. If I knew she'd be there, I would find every excuse to stay away from Scotland.This being said, the film does do a couple of things right. First, there's the theme of marriage it's a good thing, a constant, a necessity, and Charles finally starts to realise that his eternal bachelorhood counts for little, particularly when all his friends are getting married. (Not that he's inclined to do anything productive about it, alas.)

Alyssa Milano, nice virginal girl, goes to a Bohemian art school, has an affair with an equally Bohemian guy, starts reading somebody else's diary, takes on some of the traits of the diarist, develops a crush on the sensitive but happily married guru in her painting class, begins to dress Goth, cuts her hair to a wicked length, begins to smoke (gasp!), treats her loving boyfriend recklessly, shuns her art teacher when he finally begins to put moves on her after she's practically thrown herself on him, bosom first, drives art instructor mad, destroys instructor's family, is discovered in flagrante delicto by the wife, throws her black girl friend out of her room, .... zzzzzzzz.The only conceivable reason to see this piece of atrocious offal is to see Alyssa Milano take off her clothes and\/or simulate intercourse, which she doesn't do nearly often enough in my opinion as expert on art schools, the perils of wearing black garments, erotic cinema, and the contours of Milano's bosom.This is pretty crummy stuff we're dealing with here. Milano looks fine. How could she look otherwise? But her acting skills are modest, to put it kindly. Nice performance by her insane art instructor, though. Another plus for the androgyne who plays a soothing cello so that our ears are given a respite from the relentless WHANG of the score.I mean, look at this. After a wild party, her alarm wakes her for an early class with her mad art teacher. She rolls out of the bed she's occupying with her boy friend. While she's performing her morning ablutions off screen, her lover begins to complain that she's changing. She's becoming weird. You're not yourself anymore. I don't know who I'm talking to. I don't know who I'm making love to. Should he really CARE? Whoever he's making love to, the face and body resemble that of Allysa Milano. And let's face facts == no man would ever organize that sort of statement, nor would any man even know what the words mean. I don't know who I'm talking to? A WOMAN would say it, but a man?

In fact it is; however, the controversy seems to me a bit superfluous, since on purely cinematic grounds, it is not a good movie, easily Martin Scorsese's worst. But I guess The Last Temptation of Christ necessarily attracted attention due to the brand name of its director.And Scorsese's brand of story interpretation is on full display here. For Scorsese, anything that does not push some sort of envelope of decency does not go far enough. Here's the thing, though in a film that does not seek to denigrate Christianity or Catholicism, WHAT is the interest in showing Christ kiss men on the lips, getting stripped naked on the Cross and fantasizing about consummating a marriage with Mary Magdalene? The answer, of course, is provocation for the sake of provocation. When I was a schoolboy we usually categorized schoolchildren who did that sort of thing as bullies, and no one who had a hand in making or promoting (including by the writing of glowing reviews of) this film can credibly claim to be shocked by the reaction it aroused.But of course, provocation is only typically Scorsesean. And if it were the only cinematic flaw in this movie, it might not - apart from the religious aspect - have so severely dented the watchability of this movie. (Casino, Goodfellas and The Departed were all highly enjoyable despite and at times even because of their excesses.) Alas...An introspective into the burden of a dual nature (Divine\/human) on the human side of Christ might sound (to some) salaciously tempting in theory, but is a bit thornier to work out in practice. If one accepts the existence of a dual Divine\/human nature as a reality (even within a fictional universe), one would at least expect the Divine nature would thwart the worst visceral reactions of the human nature. Yet Scorsese's insistence on showing raw emotion in its most direct form for provocative reasons seriously damage the credibility of Dafoe's Jesus. There were other, more subtle ways he could have emotional burdens that may not even require much alteration to a stoic facial expression. Again, though, Scorsese and subtlety are like oil and water, and so this sort of task is simply beyond him.Then there's the script. Of course it takes lots of liberties with the Gospel account - this is Hollywood we're talking about, of course. But the parts that ARE based on Gospel text are immediately obvious to anyone who has read the Gospel accounts, and the only attempt that is made to weave actual quotes from Christ into the rest of the fabric is the total destruction of their elegance and lyricism in favor of short, banal quips that would have made a Soviet Bloc propaganda copywriter moan in exasperation. (Imagine a Biblical translation that changed This is my Son, with Whom I am well-pleased to Atta-boy! and you start to get an idea of how flat-out *bad* this is.) I would trash the acting, as well, if not for the fact that no one could have made good out of this.Finally, there's the production values. The cinematography is amateur and, I daresay, wholly unworthy of Scorsese. The sets and costumes are bland and boring if you have any sense of period accuracy, and given what we saw over a decade and a half later in The Passion of the Christ, it's not too much to say that these already-inadequate props have aged quite badly.Overall, a bad film. It may be blasphemous to God, but it's also a travesty to the great art of cinema.

(Casino, Goodfellas and The Departed were all highly enjoyable despite and at times even because of their excesses.) Alas...An introspective into the burden of a dual nature (Divine\/human) on the human side of Christ might sound (to some) salaciously tempting in theory, but is a bit thornier to work out in practice. If one accepts the existence of a dual Divine\/human nature as a reality (even within a fictional universe), one would at least expect the Divine nature would thwart the worst visceral reactions of the human nature. Yet Scorsese's insistence on showing raw emotion in its most direct form for provocative reasons seriously damage the credibility of Dafoe's Jesus. There were other, more subtle ways he could have emotional burdens that may not even require much alteration to a stoic facial expression. Again, though, Scorsese and subtlety are like oil and water, and so this sort of task is simply beyond him.Then there's the script. Of course it takes lots of liberties with the Gospel account - this is Hollywood we're talking about, of course. But the parts that ARE based on Gospel text are immediately obvious to anyone who has read the Gospel accounts, and the only attempt that is made to weave actual quotes from Christ into the rest of the fabric is the total destruction of their elegance and lyricism in favor of short, banal quips that would have made a Soviet Bloc propaganda copywriter moan in exasperation. (Imagine a Biblical translation that changed This is my Son, with Whom I am well-pleased to Atta-boy! and you start to get an idea of how flat-out *bad* this is.) I would trash the acting, as well, if not for the fact that no one could have made good out of this.Finally, there's the production values. The cinematography is amateur and, I daresay, wholly unworthy of Scorsese. The sets and costumes are bland and boring if you have any sense of period accuracy, and given what we saw over a decade and a half later in The Passion of the Christ, it's not too much to say that these already-inadequate props have aged quite badly.Overall, a bad film. It may be blasphemous to God, but it's also a travesty to the great art of cinema.

In fact it is; however, the controversy seems to me a bit superfluous, since on purely cinematic grounds, it is not a good movie, easily Martin Scorsese's worst. But I guess The Last Temptation of Christ necessarily attracted attention due to the brand name of its director.And Scorsese's brand of story interpretation is on full display here. For Scorsese, anything that does not push some sort of envelope of decency does not go far enough. Here's the thing, though in a film that does not seek to denigrate Christianity or Catholicism, WHAT is the interest in showing Christ kiss men on the lips, getting stripped naked on the Cross and fantasizing about consummating a marriage with Mary Magdalene? The answer, of course, is provocation for the sake of provocation.

The novel upon which this film was based was part of the Romantic era, and so director Michael Mann evidently tried to bring that spirit and character of the time on screen. However, the film The Last of the Mohicans is a somewhat loose translation of the book, and sometimes the so-called Romantic touches are no more than dramatic appeals to modern audiences.There are many things that may have worked in the romantic era, but in this day and age can seem essentially cheesy, especially on film. There is one scene in which Hawkeye, Daniel Day-Lewis' main character, stares at his romantic interest, Cora, provoking the question What are you looking at, sir? to which he responds, I'm looking at you, miss. What kind of response is that? This type of dialogue suggests a liberal departure from history, however Mann seems to try to ground the film in history and a trueness to that period. There lies the contradiction, and from it the feeling of cheesiness. Further, Mann also employs wide, sweeping shots of the surrounding nature in which much of the film is set. While true to the Romantic ideal of reverence for nature, after a while one does start to think, All right, the setting has been established, how about a little more intimacy with the actual characters? Although, it must be admitted backgrounds of waterfalls and palates of beautiful, green forests give the film a boost and even realism.It would be difficult to be true to romantic characteristics while trying to appeal to modern audiences. There can't be a ten-minute monologue in which Hawkeye explains to a companion exactly how he is tracking the British soldiers. Modern audiences just wouldn't care. Thankfully, Mann has the sense not to do anything of the sort. He delicately balances Romantic idealism and Hollywood blockbuster standard. The screen is blasted with gunshots, shooting arrows, flying cannons, and explosions galore, and while some of the battles may not have been so dramatic&#151;-and gory&#151;-it certainly does make the heart race in a good way.Now, how do the actors themselves stand in all this? Day-Lewis does a fine job portraying that resourceful, culturally-mixed, almost unapproachable, and All-American hero. He knows when to poke at the humor, as well as he knows how to stir the heartstrings&#151;or play out the drama in a fight sequence. What can one say? This is the kind of role made for Day-Lewis. Madeleine Stowe strongly plays his woman, Cora Munro. She plays the kind of woman who can take charge and, most importantly, grab the interest of the audience. Bringing out the strength of women in the time period, she is a fine supporting actress to the hero Hawkeye. Their romance may be a little corny, but it provides a nice side story for the film. Besides, what's a film based on a Romantic novel without a little romance? Editing is right-on, clearly bringing out the intended pace of the essentially war film. We don't have too many conversation scenes before we are thrown into a battle again, which keeps the blood pumping but also allows some story and depth to be woven into the product. Mann was clearly an experienced director who knew what he wanted and how to get there.All in all, should you watch this movie? Well, what are you looking for? Just a couple of hours to zone out to mindless violent battles? You may be a little bored at times. A timeless romance about an American-Indian and half-Scottish women who meet in the battlefield? You might be a little disappointed, though intrigued at parts. How about a film about a war that tries to be historically accurate but also can entertain with some artistry and modernity? Sit back and enjoy.

Hemmings plays an ego-maniacal, and much in demand, London photographer who is taking shots in a filthy flophouse one minute and posing ultra-glam, mod models the next. He takes a stroll in a local park and captures some frames of a couple cavorting demurely in a grassy knoll. The female of the pair, Redgrave, pleads with him to give her the film containing the photos of them, but he declines. She later comes to his apartment to retrieve the shots, but, again, he manages to hold onto them. That evening, after having indulged in some sexual play with a couple of teenage girls, he starts to believe that there's more to the photos than just a couple caught where they shouldn't be. He examines blown up portions of the pictures and thinks he sees a gunman and a body! He becomes obsessed with the matter and attempts to uncover the truth, looking for his friend Bowles at a drug-fueled party and chasing after Redgrave at a concert featuring The Yardbirds. However, the truth may turn out to be any number of things and the audience is pretty much left to its own devices in determining it when the unusual ending comes along. Redgrave may be top-billed, but this is Hemmings film almost exclusively. Everything is told from his point of view and he's in virtually every shot. Little-known at the time of filming, this seminal film made him a big name for a while. He is excellent as portraying the snotty, egotistical auteur who is forced to care about something other than himself (or is the whole mystery just more of him thinking he's important enough to have uncovered something?) Redgrave is good as well, offering up elusiveness, vulnerability and an amount of danger all at once. Miles has a small role as a married neighbor who Hemmings has a fondness for. Her handsome artist husband is played by Castle in one scene (along with a bit of another.) Birkin and Hills play the nubile girls who want Hemmings to photograph them. Veruschka, who shot to supermodel status after this, plays a gaunt, solemn-looking model who Hemmings takes photos of in a memorable sequence. (Mike Myers would later spoof this and other aspects of the era in his Austin Powers films.) The swinging London backdrop, filmed on location in most cases, makes for a fascinating milieu, even more so now that it's no longer in existence. Something must be said about the use of sound in the film. Despite the presence of Herbie Hancock's score and The Yardbirds' rock performance, what really stands out are the film's silences and sequences in which ambient sound, be it nature noises, rattling paper, dripping water or footsteps, go a long, long way in setting up a mood and an atmosphere. The filming of the blown up photographs and the way Hemmings studies them make for an unsettling, even haunting, mid-movie set piece that is surely one of the reasons the film has remained known. (And then there's the precedent-setting nudity, which really isn't all that remarkable in these jaded times.) Not everyone, however, finds the film captivating. Many viewers find it dull and overrated. The basic idea of the plot, which was itself not all that important to director Antonioni, was later reworked and re-conceptualized in the Brian de Palma thriller Blow Out, starring John Travolta.
