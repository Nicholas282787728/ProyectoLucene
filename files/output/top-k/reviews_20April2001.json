They desperately needed a hit that would put the studio back in the black and re-establish it as a major player.  They decided to bet the ranch on Ben-Hur.  They brought in William Wyler (`Wuthering Heights', `The Best Years of Our Lives', `Roman Holiday') to direct and gave him carte blanche to spend whatever it took to make the film successful.  The result was the most expensive film made to that date at $50 Million (equivalent to $300 Million in today's dollars).  Many of the sets took over a year to build.  It was lucky the film ever was finished at all.  After six months in production, they still didn't have a cast and the script by Karl Tunberg was deemed unacceptable by Wyler.  Wyler brought in Gore Vidal and Maxwell Anderson (`All Quiet on the Western Front', `Death Takes a Holiday', `Key Largo') to rewrite the screenplay and they frequently were doing desperate rewrites the night before shooting.  Producer Sam Zimbalist died during production.  The roman ships they built for the naval battle were top heavy and capsized, so they had to build a special tank where the ships were guided by wires and held upright.  An expensive 65mm camera was destroyed in a collision with a chariot. Numerous leading men were reported to have turned down the part of Ben-Hur, most notably Paul Newman, who said he didn't have the legs to appear in a tunic.  Others who were considered were Rock Hudson, Burt Lancaster, and Kirk Douglas.  Wyler couldn't find the right actor for the lead, so he turned to Charlton Heston, with whom he had done the film `The Big Country', the year before.  Heston accepted the part and the rest is history.Despite all its production problems, the film is brilliantly done and stands as an archetype of film epics.  The sets and costumes are glorious, the direction superb and the acting compelling.  The chariot race is an outstanding orchestration of set construction, stunt work and filming that is superlative even by today's standards.  Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd did almost all their own chariot driving, using stuntmen for only the most dangerous stunts.  This lent greater realism to the scenes, allowing more close-ups during the intense action.  Somehow, despite all the rewrites using three different writers, the story flowed smoothly to its final resolution.  The bitter rivalry between Judah and Messala, boyhood friends turned enemies by Messala's ambition, is well conceived and creates a sense of purpose that makes the ultimate confrontation as powerful as it is inevitable.The entire cast is terrific.  Charlton Heston gives a career performance as Judah Ben-Hur.  His combination of strength, courage, compassion and perseverance creates an attractive and heroic character that few in film history have been able to equal.  Stephen Boyd is also fantastic as Messala, with a ruthless ambition and a cold heart that stamps out lifelong friendships for personal gain.  Jack Hawkins and Hugh Griffith lead a wonderful supporting cast.This film is one of the most honored epics ever made.  It was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won 11 including Best Picture, Best Actor (Charlton Heston), Best Supporting Actor (Hugh Griffith), Best Director (William Wyler), and Best Music.  It is number 72 on AFI's top 100 of the century.  The chariot race is one of the most exciting sequences ever filmed.  I rated it a 10\/10.  They don't come much better than this.

Yeah, aren't they all? Just once, I'd like to see a movie in which the guy leaves prison a changed man and then actually DOES stay straight. What's that? It wouldn't be interesting? Touche, mon frere.All would be wonderful if Leo could just go straight, but those things never work out that way. Hey, Michael Corleone couldn't go straight in Godfather III, so why should this loser? He'll be good, he promises. He'll get a job at the railroad station with his uncle Frank (James Caan). Only that doesn't quite work out, either; his old pal Willie (Joaquin Phoenix, wooden as always) wants him to work with HIM in the railroad yards. With all this tugging going on, our boy Leo's feeling a bit overwhelmed. Where will he go? (Does it matter?)In brief, there's murder and stuff. Cops get involved. The boys from the old neighborhood, those knockabout  toughs of yore, involve Leo in bad things. The funny thing is, Wahlberg plays him as this innocent naif who seems as clueless as Little Orphan Annie might have been in the same situation. There are times when he appears crime-savvy, but for the most part, a wide-eyed state, mouth agape, is the character's trademark.Wahlberg seems to be sleepwalking through this escapade, and his supporting cast - strong as it is on paper - is no better. Burstyn has a thankless dying-mom role; Faye Dunaway plays her sister. You'd be hard-pressed to see a lot of life from either actress. Caan is becoming more of a caricature of his old-time tough-guy self; he's still fun to watch, but his performane is a little too one-note for me. And we also have Charlize Theron as Willie's fiance. Could someone please tell me WHY this young lady took this role? She looks horrid, and the role's not nearly meaty enough for her to enjoy. In short, anyone in the world could have performed the character, and Theron herself didn't add anything to it.With that tremendous cast, and with a small amount of hype involved, I expected a far better film. This one is moody, somnabulent, and dull; a vapid pastiche of overwrought and underwhelming performances.

It talks about sex (and love to some extent), the fantasies people pursue, and how it all intertwines in a weird way, with boundaries dissolving in unexpected ways and places. It gives you a lot to think and argue about, and yet there isn't much dialog going on, most of the time you just see people engaged in an erotic or sexual situation, and yet this movie utilizes the language of these situation to the full extent to send a powerful message.I urge everyone to see this movie and tell your friends to go and see it too.

Some great scenes (the scenes where Renée Zellweger confronts the jeweller is fantastic, and the scene between the Rebbe and his wife was brilliant as well), but most of it was preachy and cliched. Starting with the horridly trite hospital scene where Sonia yells &#145;Yossi!' while giving birth, it was filled with overly cheezy moments that detracted from the strong scenes.Zellweger and Glenn Fitzgerald definitely did not click - even in a confrontational manner. In fact, Fitzgerald was probably the worst actor in this film, and his character needed a strong actor to play him.

I don't know how many of you were fans of the old Godzilla movies, but I'm sure you remember the grayish, grainy, depressed look to the films. That technique is used in this film which is sort of entertaining. I liked the design of Godzilla also, but I must say the years being absent from the camera hasn't been good to the lizard king. Yes, people Godzilla has gained weight. He has a double chin, wider hips, thicker thighs and he doesn't have the energy to run anymore. Then again, I suppose eating cities would do that to you. One thing I hated about the old movies that I liked about this one is the fact that Godzilla wasn't the friend of the city ( I mean come on, he was a monster). There wasn't some kid running behind Godzilla calling his name like the little boy in the movie Shane.I found myself comparing this version of Godzilla to the hipper (or so they thought) version released in 1998 which was directed by Roland Emmerich (INDEPENDENCE DAY). As much as I hated this movie, I must say I liked this one better than the hipper one. As I stated before, I like the look of Godzilla in this one as compared to the reptilian crack baby of the '98 version. This movie has flaws all over the place. The script leads you to believe things and even takes you in that direction, but when you get there, they completely change the angle. For example (and I have no qualms about giving this part of the movie away), after a land attack by Godzilla, the ocean's temperature rises. The scientists all say it's because of the lizard.

The production design is still excellent, which is a plus, but by this time the makers knew they could do it, since they'd done it before.  I felt the first film was hampered slightly by an overly complex plot, which sometimes stifled the 'natural' humour that was trying to be created.

Happily, that mistake is rectified here, and it is her character and performance that provide some of the movie's most comedic moments.   The same deadpan tone and dark humour of the original is employed here, but in a package that children will probably also enjoy.  I always like it when film-makers don't narrow their target down to a specific audience.

Though somewhat contrived, it is an interesting device, however the two films arrived on the market too closely in time for it to be a coincidence.This film tries to do too much.
