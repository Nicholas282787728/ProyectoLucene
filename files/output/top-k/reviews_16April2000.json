I hate the first, and I loved the second. Second thing it is not a film about country music. Nor about politics. Everything serves as a background to show some real characters of American society. Everyone is there the loser, the winner, the decadent, the sad wife, the ingenuous dreamer, the lunatic. It becomes such a great film to make a brilliant, true, but in the deep optimistic mosaic of the ecletic American society. There is not a central story here; there are many stories connected, but each one has its importance in the film. The funny thing is that Robert Altman almost always succeeds in doing the same thing- telling many intersecting stories about different people, with no solid conclusion. Maybe Nashville is his best film, but Short Cuts, A Wedding and The Player, all of them similar to each other, have their unique qualities.When I saw the American Film Institute list of the 100 best American films of all time, it was a sad surprise that Nashville wasn't present. It is a true classic, an epic masterpiece, that should be seen by everyone. It's like an American Beauty for the '70s. The end (without spoiling you) is one of the most amazing of all times in my opinion. There's no big twist as in The Sixth Sense or The Usual Suspects, or something that will make you think for the rest of your life as 2001 A Space Odyssey, but it is a conclusion (not a solid conclusion, because you don't know in fact what will really happen) that will make your eyes get bright, even cry, for its emotion, grandiosity and beauty. I said that it is not a solid conclusion, but if you think a little bit it is. What happened to the decadent? What happened to the ingenuous dreamer with no talent? What happened and will happen to the talented dreamer? Well... Watch the film!

That's by far the film's highlight--it's very well done.So here's why I gave Final Destination a 4.The plot is shallow.  Death wants revenge against the survivors and goes around killing them.  Where's the suspense in that?The plot contains senseless material.  Does Alex notice the effect of Rocky Mountain High or not?  It seems not, so playing that tune, along with such other clichés as causing candles to be extinguished, wind to blow, lightning to strike, etc., only serves to tell the audience that another killing is nigh.  Talk about lack of subtlety!I agree with a previous comment that it was insensitive to draw so many parallels to the TWA flight 800 crash (high school group, New York-to-Paris flight).  I also think it's kind of racially insensitive to make Death a black guy.But what I really resented is that, as far as I could tell, the movie bowdlerized its own plot and ruined its integrity by failing to resolve the story.  The two main characters are left alive, but with no guarantee that Death has completed his mission.  And this outcome, I believe, must have been a deliberate marketing gimmick (no screenwriter could be that inept).  If Final Destination had done really well, a sequel could have been made to disclose the main characters' fates.It's sad that Hollywood is willing to screw up its movies for commercial considerations, and how oblivious many people seem to be to devices like these.

The story didn't strike me as the kind that could adapt itself to have a beginning, middle, and ending.  At least in so far as it could be told in 90-120mins.I had read several reviews of the film and found myself interested to say the least.  I understood the violent aspects of the book were largely omitted, and the movie tried to focus on more of a satirical depiction of life on Wall St. in the mid-80's.It was here that I had trouble thinking about how they could really translate the book because it constantly bombarded me with product placements and notions of status based on material wealth. I couldn't fathom how this could be conveyed through dialogue between two characters on screen.I was surprised how well the film was executed.  Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman in a performance that seemed to have manifest out of my imagination while i was reading the book. He seemed to dissolve into the character.  His physical presence was exceptional, with his facial expressions, body language, and tone of speech.  He gave Patrick multiple dimensions as not only a sadistic killer, but a faceless member of a society so defined by the material, that the inner never really shows through.This point is well driven home as many of the characters have no idea who they are really talking to from one moment to the next.  They know the people to speak, criticize, and gossip about them, but they have no idea what they really look like, even if they are speaking to them.  Patrick has conversations about himself with other people who have confused him with some other interchangeable member of the social circle.  It's quite funny to watch.The movie is extremely funny at times and extremely gory at others.  The violence is REALLY toned down from the book, but what remains is still the gory aftermath of that violence, which is significant.  Add to the fact that once you are left to imagine the violent act itself, it suddenly becomes ten times as vivid.  This film is not for the fragile or faint of heart.  Take heed.The story is as it is in the book, non linear.  There is no real beginning or end.  It's just a story about this person, and the horrible things he does.  There are some traditional plot mechanisms thrown in to give the movie some sense of linear progression, and they work well, but they betray the sheer randomness of the book, which for me was one of the endearing qualities.I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy a vivid lead character. The supporting cast is there, but not really.  Christian Bale carries this film from beginning to end just like Patrick Bateman did in the book.  It hinges on his believability and he responds powerfully.  He is convincing in every capacity.  Every move he makes, every word he speaks resonates the character of Patrick Bateman.  Congratulations and thanks to Christian Bale, for he made this film thoroughly enjoyable for me.

What hurts about having seen this movie, though, is that all too many will watch Election, and laugh at the loser for sleeping with Traci (and I agree, it serves him right!), yet secretly admire Traci for her tough-mindedness, determination and ultimate victory.  Does anyone REALLY despise her for her naked ambition?  No.  Does anyone REALLY really think for a second that Mr McAllister has a dog's chance in hell of stopping her?  No.   Does anyone care for two seconds that Tammy's de-railing attempt of the election all stems from her 'rejected lover' angst?  No.  And how many high school kids identified with the cheering mob at the possibility of no more student elections?   Millions?  Who cares?  Don't get uptight about it!  It's just a movie!  It's not like it's real for crying out loud! But what is real, is that many viewers (and not a few reviewers!)flatter themselves with; Oh yes, clever me... I'm so used to seeing this sort of thing in this terrible cynical world. Isn't it awful?  I'm so glad I'm so detached from it all... because that means I can sit back and enjoy it all! I think those with this attitude aren't doing the movie justice.Facts are, this is a damn fine movie...and not just because Reese Witherspoon and Matt Broderick portray Manipulator and Out-of-his-depth Romantic so well.  Nor because of its clever direction and sharp editing. It's great because its screenplay is a worthy adaptation of a damn fine novel with deep insights about human weaknesses. The movie's been called a black comedy - but it isn't, unless by 'black comedy' you mean it is a kind of tragedy.   And the tragedy here is that one evil (naked ambition) brings out all the worst everywhere else (lust, pride, misplaced idealism). And what's really sad, is that the message we're left with is that to be untouched by evil, you have to be a likeable dumb jock. This movie cuts.  This is a damn fine feeling-and-thinking person's movie.

Actually, the storyline is quite clever and there are a number of good sight gags, but the dialogue is uniformly dreadful and lowbrow.  The writing is hack and sitcomesque which might explain why they loaded this cast with TV actors.We are presented with two architects who are vying for a contract that can revitalize their ailing business with a roguish developer named Charles Newman (Dylan McDermot).  Charles is married and having an affair with Amy (Neve Campbell), but he is jealous and wants to keep tabs on her. Thinking Oscar (Matthew Perry) is gay and no threat, he asks him to spy on her, implying that it might help him to get the contract.  The rest is pretty predictable.  They fall in love, but she thinks he's gay so there is no hope.  Eventually love prevails (no spoiler here, no-one on the planet could watch this movie and think they wouldn't get together), but not before numerous mistaken gender orientation gags run their course.This film was obviously presented from a gay perspective as a satire on homophobia.  All the gay characters are portrayed as respectable, admirable and wise, while all the straight men are portrayed as rogues, misfits and buffoons.  You see skit after skit where homophobia is lampooned.  Women can't confide in a man unless they think he's gay, because straight men are just too insensitive to understand.  Gays in the closet are bashed repeated with snide remarks.  This probably explains why this film was more well received by women than men, since much the comedy really mocked straight men and their fear of homosexuality.Matthew Perry has made a career out of playing hapless losers with the appeal being that it's funny to see someone who is even more woefully inept than the average viewer.  While I don't find this particularly funny, I will give him his due and say that he is a master of the art.  He gets high marks for being able to simultaneously evoke laughter and sympathy over his plight.  Also, I found his chemistry good with Campbell, and his longing for her was played with a good deal of sincerity and sensitivity.Neve Campbell is really just window dressing here.  Her role is to smile, look cute and sexy and play the love interest.  This is not a real stretch for her since she can essential do all those things by just standing there.Dylan McDermot was pretty dreadful as the scoundrel.   In his defense, he didn't have much to work with since the way his part was written he was portraying more of a caricature than a character.  It is difficult for an actor to slip into the skin of an absurdity and know exactly how to play it.The best acting in the film came from Oliver Platt, who played Oscar Novak's business partner.  He was funny and played an excellent straight man to Perry's clown.  Platt is a veteran and a professional and always brings substance to his supporting roles.This film has its moments but not enough of them.  It is effective social satire and it is mildly successful as a romantic comedy, but it bogs down frequently with too many variations on the same gay theme.  Though funny in parts, it is generally just silliness.  I rated it a 5\/10.

I'm a serious movie buff and when a film looks interesting; I go absolutely insane and desperate waiting for the film to come out. As time went by I started to see comments about people who saw screening at Sundance and so forth. Some comments were positive, some very negative. Nevertheless the good overcame the negative comments. So the film is finally released and of course I'm anxious to see it. I go to the theater but it's sold out. So the next day I go to the theater and I'm in! As I saw the films I am overwhelmed by the beautiful imagery, style, characters, and so forth. Overall, I was very satisfied. My only complaint was the ending.The idea of a man killing women in order to maintain a sense of sanity does sound a bit repulsive. Of course feminist groups will protest against this movie but there is a lot of missing information. The character Patrick Bateman doesn't only kill women; he kills men as well. He uses women as meat for sexual pleasures. Once he's done using them he eventually kills them. As for the men, he simply kills them out of jealousy. One thing about Patrick Bateman is that he hates people being more successful than him. So he strives to be superior to everyone. How so? By killing people. Even though some killings of his are rather illogical, some actually do make some serious points. His monologues before he kills his victims will help you decide whether or not his killings carry any sense of logic in them. Still, everything Bateman does has certain intelligence to it.The ending was a bit of a let down. It seems that recent films tend to strive for the psychological ending, which I love. Fight Club had it; Stir of Echoes had it, the Sixth Sense, and now American Psycho. But American Psycho's lacked something. I am still not sure I understand the ending yet. I could have been that Bateman was actually insane and had to kill everyone to be at ease, or if his killings were all a state of mind- meaning he imagined and believed in them so much he thought they were real. Something that might have improved the film is if we could have seen what Bateman's secretary does after she sees his daily planner. Chris Bale has simply come a long way from being the kid in Empire from the Sun. His role back then was Oscar worthy, and it's even more apparent that he deserves recognition for his role as an insane-psychopathic Yuppie from the 80s. Overall the film is simply brilliant. It is a smart film and it is extremely well made. I'm just happy to see that an independent film such as this captivated the interest of many Hollywood mainstreamers. If anything we need more independent movies to get a wider audience. So far this is the best film I've seen so far this year due to a flawless performance by Bale, and the help of great direction.

Still, everything Bateman does has certain intelligence to it.The ending was a bit of a let down. It seems that recent films tend to strive for the psychological ending, which I love. Fight Club had it; Stir of Echoes had it, the Sixth Sense, and now American Psycho. But American Psycho's lacked something. I am still not sure I understand the ending yet. I could have been that Bateman was actually insane and had to kill everyone to be at ease, or if his killings were all a state of mind- meaning he imagined and believed in them so much he thought they were real. Something that might have improved the film is if we could have seen what Bateman's secretary does after she sees his daily planner. Chris Bale has simply come a long way from being the kid in Empire from the Sun. His role back then was Oscar worthy, and it's even more apparent that he deserves recognition for his role as an insane-psychopathic Yuppie from the 80s. Overall the film is simply brilliant. It is a smart film and it is extremely well made. I'm just happy to see that an independent film such as this captivated the interest of many Hollywood mainstreamers. If anything we need more independent movies to get a wider audience. So far this is the best film I've seen so far this year due to a flawless performance by Bale, and the help of great direction. Lets hope it gains the recognition it deserves.  ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"16 April 2000","score":"","review":"  Many IMDb-Users have commented that this is the movie who brought the horror genre back to life. I disagree. What Scream really did was to invent a more or less new kind of genre. It definitely has horror elements in it but more important are the teenagers that are all over this film. All right, Halloween (1978) did have teenagers too but still the film was about the killer (Michael Myers) himself and not about the kids he happened to kill.What I'm trying to say is that Scream is a good film. But after the huge success many other studios tried to make money with other teen-horror flicks that were aiming at the same audience. And that's where it got really stupid. Scream could have been unique but unfortunately it spawned a whole generation of similar films that fed of the same basic idea but just failed to be original. The makers of Scream were lucky to publish the film at a time where there were almost no good horror films anymore and that's why it attracted that many people.Scream is a good combination of horror and comedy\/parody, there's no question about that. The general problem with this kind of film always was that it is very difficult for a film to be scary and funny at the same time. Craven and Williamson avoided to mix comedy and scares in the same scenes and separated these two elements. That's the reason why Scream did what others haven't been able to do.The film is by no means as scary as the true horror films (Halloween, The Evil Dead, A Nightmare on Elm Street and others) but has its scares. The opening scene is very intense and sadistic but we already get some allusions to other horror films. This scene is more intense than the whole remaining 100 minutes. There are other scenes where the killer is very sadistic when killing his victims but it never gets really scary. Although the killer looks great in the white mask I didn't have the impression that he was as dangerous as good old Michael Myers or Fred Krueger. The idea of a 18 year old psycho-boy hiding behind that mask didn't make it any scarier.But of course Scream wasn't supposed to be plain horror. More important are the allusions to other horror films and these were done very good. Some of the jokes were a little too obvious but I guess otherwise most of the ignorant viewers out there wouldn't understand it. On the other hand I think I still haven't noticed them all myself.Another important aspect is the who's-the-lunatic-behind-the-mask question. We have the time to get to know all the persons including the one(s) that is\/are responsible for the murders. Honestly, I didn't have the slightest idea who would be the killer (I didn't think about it very heavily though). Some persons have commented that they found the film to be predictable. They are either very clever or lying and I tend to say the latter thing is true (no offence included).I hope I didn't make it sound as if this movie was mediocre because it isn't. It is clever, suspenseful in some places and very amusing in others. Overall it is one of the most original films of the decade and perfect to watch with a group of friends.I highly recommend this movie but also advise you to stay away from the imitations that followed.My rating 10\/10 (Don't expect the sequels to be equally clever!)
