[{"date":"9 September 2000","score":"21 out of 23 people found the following review useful","review":"  Outside Providence seems like just another low budget, goofy high school comedy from the preview, but it is really a good movie. Timothy Dunphy is the lovable high school screw-up whose father sends him off to boarding school after he is involved in an accident with a parked police cruiser while smoking pot with his loser buddies. He develops an unlikely romantic relationship with the stunningly beautiful Jane Weston (Amy Smart) at the repressive school while fighting off the disciplinary excesses of the school faculty. This seems like the premise of the kind of ridiculous high school comedies that characterized the 80s (Screwballs, Ski School, etc.), but Outside Providence works well because it has heart. Timothy Dunphy is sent off unwillingly to this hellish school, and it turns out to be a really eye-opening experience for him. He develops a lot of insight about himself, his friends, his romantic endeavors, and his family. The story is not exactly something that is entirely original, but the presentation of the film and the acting are extremely good, and the end result is a great comedy. Alec Baldwin delivers a hilarious performance as the emotionally closed-off father, regularly referring to his own son as dildo. He steals every scene he is in, and he should be particularly noted for his ability to give such a convincing portrayal of an emotionless, macho father and still be convincing in the emotionally tense scene between him and Timothy where he describes Tim's late mother. That scene in particular is unexpectedly intense.Outside Providence is a good comedy. It does not resort to tasteless sexual fourth-grade humor to pull it along (which is one of the biggest problems with teen comedies lately - American Pie, Scary Movie (there was no hope for that one from the beginning), There's Something About Mary, and Road Trip, which should have been a great movie). Instead, Outside Providence focuses on character development and a good story, and tops it all off with a healthy amount of comedy in the form of the cast, the characters, the script, dialogue, and pretty much everything else. Probably one of the best elements of this movie is that it is not a relentless comedy. It doesn't grab desperately for a laugh every second of the way, but instead it rounds out the content with drama, romance, skillful comedy, as well as good writing, directing, and acting. Outside Providence is badly underrated and should not be missed.

One in which serious themes such as violence, betrayal and killing are taken very lightly. Think not 'Dogma' or 'Pillow Talk' but rather 'Throw Momma From the Train'. This kind of dark humor has probably put more than one critic off the film, but if you understand the nature of the genre you can see past it and laugh at the absurdities. And absurdities abound. When we first see Renée Zellweger's character, Betty, she is nice and sweet to the point of unreality. Everybody ignores or takes advantage of her. In short, she is a doormat, and would be unbelievable, were it not for the fact that I have seen a few Bettys in my time. She is a type of holy fool, consecrated to the cult of soap's A REASON TO LOVE'S Dr. David Ravell. And when in the face of trauma and death she goes round the bend, she embarks on a pilgrimage from Kansas to L.A. to seek out her icon. Greg Kinnear's performance as Dr. Ravell\/George McCord, the idol with feet of all-too-human clay, hits just the right notes of Hollywood insincerity and smarminess, reflecting the desperation of an almost has-been actor who would consider anything to avoid the specter of his soap character being killed off. And we see Freeman's character Charlie in his devotions, carrying around, talking to and fussing over photos of Betty as if they were holy relics.Morgan Freeman's performance in this film is pure pleasure, akin to seeing a Frank Lloyd Wright house, tasting and enjoying the bouquet of a fine wine vintage or listening to the smoky vocals of Ray Charles or Macy Gray. Whether admiring Betty's wedding picture, reading aloud to Wesley from her diary, contemplating her image as they chase her cross-country in the car or stalking her outside the apartment where she is staying, he fills out his role of the hitman Charlie with unexpected dimensions. In past interviews MF has expressed a longing to expand past his usual staid and dignified typecasting, and here he finally gets to do it. Ironically, though he could receive a fourth Oscar nomination for this part, he probably won't win it. It would be only be for Best Supporting Actor, anyway... With Betty (once jerky, dismissive husband Del is put out of the way) and Kinnear's Dr. Ravell\/George McCord these three characters focus the movie. Each one of them suffers from misdirected devotion once Betty's eyes are finally opened she realizes it as she listens to Charlie describing himself to her as if he were writing a lovelorn personals ad. In response she gently tells him, I don't think I'm who you think I am. And in one scene with the soap star she quotes a friend who once told her if he were any handsomer it'd be a crime, then in the next breath with an earthy if astute observation of his character proceeds to demolish his actor's ego, shattering the last of the illusions he has accumulated in the course of his involvement with her. In all this, Chris Rock's Wesley doesn't fit in. He is the odd man out in this triangle; he kicks against its edges, but does little more than inflict various dings to its sides. But the one real damage we see him do early in the film is enough to precipitate the whole mad chase. Think of his character as the fulcrum that sets this unbalanced object rolling. He and Charlie are an oddly matched pair. As father-son the two actors pull it off, Rock's raunchy raucous comedic talent and MF's steady, centered presence balancing and complementing one another. There is one very funny moment where Charlie hauls Wesley's struggling form out of an office, as if corralling a tantrumming five-year-old. There is another more telling scene, however, where the family dynamic is suddenly reversed Wesley rebukes his dad's fantasizing, telling him in effect that he won't stand for it. It matters not that Wesley is addicted to A REASON TO LOVE and has a case of the hots for the actress playing Jasmine; that does not begin to match the level of obsession involved in Charlie's cherishing and taping back together a snapshot of Betty that his son had torn and scattered in a fit of pique. Charlie and Wesley may be related, but as in most families, the two are real opposites son Wesley is outwardly charming but boiling over with rage and violence inside (like the character Mouse in DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS, or, more interestingly, one of Freeman's past roles, the Times Square pimp Fast Black in STREET SMART). On the other hand, his father Charlie in his capacity as a professional hitman has been there and seen enough to keep his belligerence firmly on the outside often he will take someone roughly in hand, then in soothing tones tell them something like you haven't been forthcoming to us. Neil LaBute seems to have handled his directing duties well. The casting of the leads is superb, he lets each do what they do best, and there is enough light shining through the cinematography (and the story) to avoid the charges of claustrophobic film-making that were lodged against his prior projects. At times the pacing seemed uneven, a little slow, particularly in the first 45 minutes of the film. Indeed it seemes that it gets faster and faster the further one gets into the film; perhaps cutting back and forth too quickly in the last, most important scenes. Also, a few story points seemed truncated or edited out, such as Charlie's fantasy sequence with Betty (they kiss, but not dance? And if so, why does Wesley deride his father later for dancing alone in the dark?) and the subplot involving Fair Oaks' sheriff and newspaperman. In NURSE BETTY there is not only idealization of the central character, the soap star and the fantasy milieu of Hollywood but also of time. Throughout the film there are harkenings back to a simpler era several visual cues relating Betty to Dorothy in Wizard of Oz (check out her waitress uniform and her garb in the fantasy with Charlie) the mention of Doris Day, the old car Charlie and Wesley drive in, break down, then have repaired again. And if Betty is a Dorothy in search of self-fulfillment, then in some sense Charlie is the Wizard, the man behind the curtain. In the denouement he in essence tells her that she needs no hero; that in herself she has the heart, the brains and the courage to make her way in the world on her own. And that makes that last chaste, real kiss he bestows on her cheek almost a benediction.

He has learned a little from Methos - that being, Live, grow stronger, fight another day.The conflict between Duncan and Connor was one of love and survival.  It was the offering of the ultimate sacrifice.  Sacrifice to the other in order that they both should be able to live on in some way.  Love of each other that they would want that.  This followed history of the series and the movie.I loved that they flashed back to Heather and Connor's recollections of her and his time with her.  I loved that they brought up the fact that immortal will grow old and die if they don't experience an unnatural death.As for the supposed inconsistencies, Connor only gained what he believed to be the prize in the first movie. If he truly was the final immortal then Duncan was dead.  But Duncan wasn't dead.  So Connor never did receive the prize, he only thought he had.This was brought out in the third movie.  It showed his reaction when he realized he had not received the prize after all.  By then, he had lost his wife in the car crash (which is referred too in this movie, as well as the second - the one that doesn't make sense).  Then something happened to his adoptive son (not mentioned but must be supposed as well), and the to lose Rachel, his other adoptive child, as well.  He basically loses everything he has valued outside of his relationship with Duncan - which he feels he will eventually loose as well as Duncan is an immortal.I can imagine the premise that he would want to escape into a world of drugs and illusions.

Based part in fact and part in fantasy but all of it takes place inside Connor's mind.With this in mind this movie could have incorporated all of the Highlander movies - the first and original Highlander movie, the second (being something twisted inside Connor's mind), the third a small episode in Connor's life, before the death of Rachel, and finally this one.Congratulations to the writers and players of the newest Highlander movie. It is a difficult story to write for because of all the fans and subplots and such within it.  But, I feel you did extremely well with it.  I enjoyed the show and it stimulated many more questions and theories within my mind. Thank you for the challenge.

The lack of dialog doesn't make a movie more profound. Not giving all the answers doesn't necesary mean philosophy comes jumping around the corner. Shooting a scene longer than really necessary doesn't mean you're an artist. If it's possible to know the point of a scene after 3 seconds .. you don't want need to see 8 different angles of the same scene for 3 minutes long!! (and I can't even begin to describe the scene where the scientist (Floyd) travels from the earth-orbiter to the moon... ooh my God.. the boredom!!!)So why should I care what the true meaning is of the monoliths, if the story is told in such a boring way? Why should I care what the ending means to the movie, myself or mankind, if the scenes themselves are a big question mark?I don't need to be spoon-fed all the clues, I don't need the blasters, bloodthirsty aliens and one-liners to enjoy sci-fi's AND I love a good philosophical discussion, but please give me a reason to discuss! I know what Kubrick and Clarke hoped to make us ponder about (I won't spoil it.. if that's even possible), but this is not the way to do it.The comments about this movie remind me of the monkeypaintings that were hung in a museum and reviewed by art-experts true meaning is in the eye of the beholder, but the meaning doesn't have to be there in the first place. Kubrick tried this, even said so in his interviews, but still the movie itself is flawed. Not the special-effects, not the makers intentions, not the ideas that are presented.. they are excellent, genuine and truly visionary, but the flaw was simply in the way the story was told.And as for the notion that you should read the book to understand the movie That is another example of why the movie failed. A movie should tell it's tale by itself and should not need any outside assistance!1 star for the special effects (1968!), 1 star for Kubrick's and Clarke's intentions**\/***** ","genre":null},{"date":"9 September 2000","score":"3 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":"  Unbelievable... the dullness... the so-called philosophical journey... it's all a bunch of crap.
