This movie was so pointless and a waste of time. Period. I didn't find it funny at all. I can't believe people love this movie. The humor was so elementary. However, I'm sure others enjoy hearing about hand jobs and whatnot. I mean, I can take stupid jokes, but there was nothing witty about it or having a point to the scene. Written by Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson? No wonder... an actor and a director -- they need to hire a real WRITER.First of all, how can one enjoy a movie if everything about the main character is just plain annoying and sooo full of himself. If you can't root or care for the character, there's already a problem. Not to mention he's pretty much the same in the end. Not only that, but the plot is absolutely stupid and nothing special, especially the way it is executed because it's so forced. People don't really talk or act like they do in this movie in real life. Max (the main guy) becomes best friends with Bill Murray (typical poor Bill supporting role here) and then falls for a new teacher at Rushmore. And what a surprise, Bill suddenly falls for the teacher too. We basically see Max and Bill Murray do pranks on each other, but in the end, they makeup. How cute. Meanwhile, Max tries to hook up Bill by wasting Bill's money and working on his stupid high-budget-special-effects-explosion plays. Max's play is a success and everyone is just one big happy family. Give me a break.This movie takes more time on pointless subplots than focusing\/spending time on a major plot.It's obvious the director just wanted to use many of his favorite 70's songs in this movie. I think it's dumb people give high votes on the movie just because of the soundtrack.If you're one of those people who loved Donnie Darko, then you'll probably love this too because I thought both movies were just stupid and just hype. Also, if you loved the fake acting in Juno then you'll probably love the way they act in this movie too. I should have known this guy directed Royal Tenenbaums. That movie was so overrated as well, even though it had an all-star cast. I rather watch Royal Tenenbaums again than this movie, but I honestly don't understand Wes Anderson's taste.Skip it. Save your precious 1 hour and 30 minutes of life.

There is little realism with just in time situations and how humans actually get into Looney Tune land, but is this a film to give explanation to anything?

So I watched it this afternoon and over all, I think it was a good movie, it was definitely a different concept. We got to see our president's more human side, he's our leader, but he's also a person as well. What would it be like to have a president who wants to date someone? I thought that this is a pretty well written film, I'm not really into political films, but this story worked very well and was mature as well. Michael Douglas and Annette Benning were just beautiful together and had great chemistry on screen. Michael held himself well as the president of the United States, he brought a more sensitive side to the character. We have also a great supporting cast like Michael J. Fox, Richard Dreyfuss, and Martin Sheen who made the story very believable.President Andrew Shepherd is very loved by his people, the next election seems like and open and shut competition since everyone loves him. But his wife passed three years prior and he's raising his daughter as well as having to be the president of our country. When he meets with a lobbyist who represents the Global Warming Commity, her name is Sydney, and immediately, they are attracted to each other. But when election time comes up, his opposing canidate is hitting him hard as well as the American people for his personal life.The American President is worth the look, it's a nice movie that gives a different look into the president. But it was a sweet story and the acting was very good, of course the film has little flaws here and there, but they're looked over. Michael is very charismatic on screen, with Rob Reiner as the director, you could never go wrong.

A weird guy with a German accent, Ballin Mundson, just happens to be strolling along down by the docks and saves Johnny by whipping out a sharp knife hidden inside his cane. Thus begins the very strange and not all that entertaining pseudo-noir, 'Gilda'. Mundson hands Johnny his card and invites him to play at his casino. Before you know it, Mundson hires Johnny as the manager after Johnny convinces him that he can use his skills as a crooked gambler to ferret out customers bent on cheating the house. Mundson introduces Johnny to his wife, Gilda, played by Rita Hayworth. Gilda can't stand Mundson but obviously married him for his money. The only thing that is truly understandable in this movie is Gilda's disdain for Mundson who is continually trying to suck up to her acting like a besotted 16 year old wuss. Mundson's jealousy knows no bounds and it's this jealousy that defines his character&#151;so much so that the character becomes totally one-note. There is so much of Mundson's jealousy we can take before saying, 'enough already'. Fortunately for the film-goer, Mundson disappears halfway through the movie, only to return at the end.Meanwhile, without providing any back story, Johnny and Gilda knew each other before. When they meet again they have a thorough disdain for one another. Johnny tells Gilda, I hate you, Gilda tells Johnny, I hate you and one of them (or maybe both, I can't remember) slaps the other in the face. Like Mundson's jealousy, the disdain is unrelenting but at a certain point they declare their love for one another, end up in a passionate embrace and before you know it, get married. Finally, closet nice-guy Johnny starts morphing into Mundson (after Johnny takes over the casino following Mundson's apparent suicide, nose-diving his single pilot aircraft into the ocean)and becomes jealous of Gilda's new singles life. Gilda tells Johnny that dating other men is just an act for Johnny to pay more attention to her but Johnny won't buy it. He becomes so jealous that he has one of his henchmen at the casino physically remove every new date from Gilda's proximity causing her to flee to Montevideo where she meets a new man, a lawyer who convinces her to return home and get an annulment. When she returns, she finds out that her new boyfriend, the lawyer, was paid by Johnny to get her to return. Gilda is shattered when Johnny tells her that annulments are not legally valid in Buenos Aires (unfortunately Gilda is not a law school graduate!).Just like Mundson, Johnny's jealousy toward Gilda becomes tiresome. But unlike Mundson, Johnny's 'true feelings' toward Gilda cannot be kept down. He somehow realizes that he's been the biggest heel all along and once again falls for Gilda (please don't ask me what motivates these sudden reversals in the characters' behavior). Just as Johnny changes his mind about Gilda (again) Mundson returns and in a jealous rage attempts to murder both Johnny and Gilda. Mundson is struck down by the kindly bathroom attendant who presciently has referred to Johnny as a 'peasant' from the beginning of the film. The police inspector does his Captain Renault imitation from Casablanca by stepping in and hinting that Johnny and Gilda will not be charged for Mundson's death, that the official cause of death is still a suicide and not to matter anyway, it was a justifiable homicide. There is also a subplot in 'Gilda' that is just as confusing as the love triangle. Mundson has cornered the Tungsten market and double-crossed two Germans he knew during the War who show up at the Casino claiming they are the rightful leaders of a cartel. We never find out anything about the Germans except that Mundson ends up killing one of them and that's why he has to flee (oh there's another weird guy, a businessman who attempts to shoot Mundson at the casino after Mundson won't let him do business with a member of his cartel. The weird guy is unable to kill Mundson so he ends up shooting himself). As one poster aptly put it here, Gilda is a 'poor man's Casablanca'. In some ways, Gilda is so bad that it's actually somewhat entertaining. One can actually sit back and enjoy all the full blown histrionics. But ultimately none of the jealous machinations of the characters are ever sufficiently explained nor are the reversals&#151;the odd changes of heart where the lovers are reconciled. Gilda is a story where the characters don't earn our respect&#151;they're locked in a pointless battle simply designed to titillate the masses of people soon to become addicted to daytime soap operas on television in the 1950s.

We never find out anything about the Germans except that Mundson ends up killing one of them and that's why he has to flee (oh there's another weird guy, a businessman who attempts to shoot Mundson at the casino after Mundson won't let him do business with a member of his cartel. The weird guy is unable to kill Mundson so he ends up shooting himself). As one poster aptly put it here, Gilda is a 'poor man's Casablanca'. In some ways, Gilda is so bad that it's actually somewhat entertaining. One can actually sit back and enjoy all the full blown histrionics. But ultimately none of the jealous machinations of the characters are ever sufficiently explained nor are the reversals&#151;the odd changes of heart where the lovers are reconciled. Gilda is a story where the characters don't earn our respect&#151;they're locked in a pointless battle simply designed to titillate the masses of people soon to become addicted to daytime soap operas on television in the 1950s.

Like with each other movie of his, Welles completely reinvents himself. Each of his movies takes its origin in a wholly innovative and groundbreaking thought. He reinvents the cinema with each of his movies. Welles' cinema is a school. Here the most imposing artistic thought dominated its matter;it is a question about art above everything else. Life can not be defined; creation is a fact of life. Yet, one can say that Welles was an architect, a creator of architectures, and a baroque master in a puritanical epoch.

For some reason, Thanksgiving is a neglected holiday in terms of movie-making. That being said, there is one Thanksgiving movie that not only is far and above the best of its kind, it also stands as one of the greatest holiday pictures of all-time. Planes, Trains, and Automobiles was John Candy at his best, Steve Martin at his best, and also writer\/director John Hughes at his absolute prime. Mixing classic slapstick with outstanding dialogue, masterpiece moments, and a heavy dosage of heart that slowly builds then delivers towards the end, this 1987 film never preaches and never slows down a second. Every five minute a conflict arises, usually leading to a hilarious conclusion but lessons learned from the two main characters. This is a must see every fourth Thursday in November.In Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, a bumbling cynical marketing success story (Steve Martin) meets a talkative yet helpful and loving traveling salesman (John Candy) as they both embark on a road trip across the snow-infested United States to reach Chicago in time for Thanksgiving. All sorts of transportation are used, but they are all failing and letting down the two main characters for different reasons. Flights are being delayed, trains are breaking down, traffic is heavy, car rental places aren't being reliable, and vehicles are fighting against Mother Nature. John Hughes is the sole writer in this tale, and manages to deliver plenty of laughs, one-liners and complications in a short 93 minutes. Throughout all the troubles, Neal and Del learn a lot about each other, and a bit more about themselves.Steve Martin and John Candy were decent before, but absolutely delivered in this movie. Both fit their roles perfectly well; as we see Steve Martin at his funniest and angriest, and John Candy in his most down-to-earth role. Neither of the two ever stole the spotlight, they each shared incredible moments; whether it's the close encounter with two trucks, waking up together very close, or driving a car obviously not fit for the road. Individually, they each had one classic moment; with Martin's tirade at a rental place and Candy singing Ray Charles by himself while driving. There was such an amazing balance in this movie, it would be years before we see such chemistry amongst the main two stars in a film (See Dumb and Dumber in 1994).John Hughes, known for his teen comedies that mesh hilarity with angst and heart, reached his quality peak here. He successfully combines comedy and drama for adults, and packs layers of emotion within 93 minutes. One can dissect this movie and realize it's much deeper than it looks from the outside. One has to see the movie a second time, because some of the elements make more sense after seeing the ending. And what can I say about the ending? It was a quiet and gradual build up, then unleashes in the final moments in such a surprising manner. Martin and Candy prove that they can do drama just as well as comedy in the final five minutes. Decades later, it still stands as one of the most underrated and most unexpected endings you'll ever see. After laughing until you are teary-eyed within the first 80-something minutes, your throat will suddenly swell up upon seeing certain revelations and ugly truths.Bottom Line No more discussion, I think I've said enough about this film; if you have seen this movie, I am basically preaching to the choir as to how good this film is. Otherwise, you better drop everything and watch this movie now. It presents an amazing story about family, about people, about life's sudden curveballs. There isn't a better Thanksgiving movie within a country mile and this is leagues above the average holiday movie, and this does include It's a Wonderful Life, any Christmas Carol movie you can come up with, and Hughes' most successful work; which was Home Alone. The acting, writing, directing, pacing, and amount of sentimentality is incredible, as we see the best work of two veteran actors and an acclaimed writer. Bring the family and friends (and some tissue paper), and prepare for a delightful experience.

Remaining one of the most critically acclaimed films of the century, it's a shame that Yang left us before making another film but did broaden eyes to his other obscure works such as A Brighter Summer Day (1991) and The Terrorizers (1986); as all the practiced methods in these films come to their highest point of intimacy in Yi yi. Shuffling between a range of moods and themes, the focus and basic premise of Yi yi is a middle-class family in Taipei over the course of one year, beginning at a wedding and ending at a funeral. The characters disband and we follow each subplot discovering and developing each of them; the father (N.J.) spends time with his long lost first love, imagining what his life could have been and studying his past behaviour; the mother (Min-Min) who feels trapped in her status of housewife; the daughter (Ting-Ting) who discovers first love; and the son (Yang-Yang) who evaluates his surroundings. Other prominent characters include the husband and bride of the afore mentioned wedding and the soon to be deceased.The pivotal theme of Yi yi is in general the love we give and receive all throughout life &#x96; although this is not demonstrated in any chronological order within the film. First, there's the love a baby receives (which the bride from the wedding carries throughout the film) from the whole family and the parents &#x96; of which this mutual and constant love remains for eternity. Then as a young child, Yang-Yang, he just begins to notice girls and the effect they have on him.

When Yang-Yang prefers to eat McDonalds rather than food at the wedding he indulges and makes no fuss. After this particular scene, he encounters an ex-girlfriend by an elevator who confronts him for standing her up at a date several years ago. N.J. does not respond. Throughout a much later set meeting in the third act, we discover that N.J. was in fact the nervous type, which leads us to evaluate his current behaviour against his old one &#x96; there's the use of parallels by having his study of his past behaviour over his daughter and her boyfriend's first date, following these patterns. Though he has reached a new stage in his life and he's finally comfortable with the woman, he doesn't feel the attraction. When it comes to business, he is very calculating, understanding what to do but when he feels pressure he escapes to music. Plus he is co-operative but not dominating.Due to all these themes and the effect of personal impact it had on me, I refer to this film as the most enlightening and life-affirming film of all-time for me.

I think my hate for it was based on when I first saw it at the age of about 16, I really wasn't mature to appreciate the sheer beauty of The Godfather. When released it became of the biggest grossing movies of the 70's and it's no hard to see why. There are so many great aspects of The Godfather. The characters are just so well etched out. The story centres around the Corleone family who are involved with the underworld and their fight to gain supremacy of the underworld over a couple of decades. There is Don Corleone, who maybe an underworld figure but is a man of principle. An example of that is in the scene where he refuses to start selling drugs. Then there is Sonny,who is a far more ruthless man than his father. Micheal, who is the good son is working towards a respectable career. Their worlds turn upside down when Don is almost killed by rival. Sonny takes over the family business and wants revenge. Micheal gets his hands dirty by gunning down the rival(in the famous restaurant scene). Micheal is forced to flee the country so that he can avoid going to jail. Sonny is then eventually killed by rivals and Micheal is forced to run the business. After a few murders Micheal becomes as much of a ruthless mobster as his deceased brother Sonny. What is so remarkable is how family life and business life are intertwined so beautifully. In the beginning at the wedding for instance when they decide to do favours for their guests. All the leads were extraordinary,my personal favourite being Marlon Brando as Don Corleone. There are very few movies that can still shock audiences thirty years after they were first released, The Godfather is one of those rare movies. The scene in which a producer finds his beloved horse in bed with him was deeply disturbing. The Godfather I believe stands heads and shoulders above any Gangster movies because The Godfather is not just about the Mafia, it's also about family. I think most of the credit for the Godfather should go to Francis Ford Coppola. I regard The Godfather to be one of the most remarkable and iconic movies ever made and all the people involved with it should be applauded. Highly recommended to lovers of classic cinema.

Most obvious of course is the title knock off of genre favorite High Noon, and it just keeps building from there. Chon Wang\/John Wayne was a hoot, along with the very obvious naming of the bad guy sheriff after high profile character actor Lee Van Cleef. Then there's the bit where Jackie Chan's horse does the gimmick with the blanket, something I'd seen done before by no less notable equine stars as Roy Rogers' Trigger and Tonto's Scout in pictures going back to the early 1950's. Above all, I couldn't help noticing in scene after scene how much Owen Wilson looked like Redford's Sundance Kid, so much so that I could almost picture him as Paul Newman's sidekick in that 1969 film, except Wilson couldn't even come close as an actor. Which is OK if you're going for the over the top kind of comedy that this one does, but then you have to be prepared for mixed results. By that I'm thinking about scenes like the drunken hot tub splish splash that would have been alright if done just once, but got to be tedious after just the second time. There were just too many moments like that one that seemed to interfere with the flow of the story. Brandon Merrill had the thankless task of Chon Wang's Indian wife, who seemed to pop up from time to time to let us know she was around, but without any real connection to the story. So she came through with a save near the end of the picture, but why do the flip flop for Roy O'Bannon (Wilson) as Chon Wang pairs off with the Princess (Lucy Liu)? Not very realistic or believable, especially on the part of the women. I would expect a Chinese princess to have more class than that, and an Indian maiden would certainly have had more discipline.But let's face it, you go into a Jackie Chan film for the martial arts choreography and innovative fight scenes, so on that score, this one delivers. Hard to imagine how you could incorporate trees and moose antlers into a fight routine, but Jackie does it with style. I'd like to know if you could expend all that energy beating up on six Crow warriors and still remain standing, but I think we all know that answer - it's a movie.Say, I noticed something that made me curious relative to a street sign in Carson City in the latter part of the picture. You could only make out a portion of the message that stated 'Bulldog Drummond's &#133;'. So I did a quick google to learn that Bulldog Drummond's first literary appearance occurred in a 1920 novel. That would have been quite the feat to predict his existence approximately forty years into the future from the story's setting in 1881.

And that summarizes my problem with this film - I dispute this commonly accepted vision of that time period.I recognize that American Graffiti was considered ground-breaking, and that it is very clearly captures the view that America in 1962 was, metaphorically, a teenager on the verge of growing up and losing its innocence, just like the kids in the movie (which introduced many talented young actors). In the 11 short years from 1962 to 1973, when the film was made, America had changed in ways that are hard to even comprehend.Lucas utilized dozens of pop songs from the period of 1955-1962 to evoke that by-gone era, vividly capturing how much the culture had changed. The old-time rock 'n roll style had essentially vanished by 1973, after The Beatles, the British invasion in general, psychedelic rock, heavy metal and other diverse musical styles came on the scene. By comparison, if a movie was made now (2008) and tried to evoke a time period 11 years ago, would 1990's music (Nirvana, Green Day, Backstreet Boys) sound so starkly different from today's music that it would sonically conjure up an entirely different Epoch? I don't think so.Thus, the use of 50's pop music aptly serves to illustrate the point. However, Lucas also beats us over the head with this music. Everywhere in this film, a car radio is on in the background, reminding us (over and over and over and over) about the good times, great oldies of the 50's. Since I don't particularly love this music, the incessant nature of it drove me nuts.But my biggest complaint with this film is the myth that America in 1962 was a time of innocence which was destroyed by the Kennedy assassination, Vietnam, and the emergence of the hippie counterculture. I think this Boomer-generation myth only tells THEIR part of the American story. Sure, the 1950's may have been an idyllic time of innocence for white suburban kids driving around in their big gas-guzzling Chevrolets. But what was it like for Blacks suffering from Jim Crow, gays and lesbians who were forced to hide in the closet, non-conformists of any kind, political victims of McCarthyism, etc. Was it Happy Days for these people? When I listen to 1950's music, I think about how pop and rock music improved so dramatically in the mid-to-late 1960's (thank you, John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Mick Jagger, James Brown), and, similarly, I think America itself improved during those tumultuous years.Therefore, while I acknowledge that Lucas captures his PERSONAL vision of this by-gone era very well, I don't accept the Boomer myth that this was an innocent time, or the so-called good old days. Rather, 1962 seems dull, insular, small-minded, stifling in its conformity, and all-around LAME.

But I happened to stumble across Saving Private Ryan as our class was doing a WWII project, and so decided to watch it. Although maybe it was preachy (somewhat) and yet still not extremely historically accurate (I should know, considering that I watched it for a history project), one thing that I could not deny with an open mind is that Saving Private Ryan is epic film-making at its finest.As far as the story is concerned, I won't go too deep into historical accuracy, but as long as the important things are set straight and the story makes sense on its own, I'm happy with it. That being said, there should have been more effort put into showing how other Allied nations besides America contributed to the war, at least during the beach landing sequence. This is my biggest gripe with the story, and even then it's a fairly minor gripe.Some more background on the war would have also helped a lot to lend that extra authenticity edge to the movie, but the lack of it doesn't come down hard at all since most of us know it anyways. Aside from that, the story is fairly straightforward, which is good, since most of it is packed with great, amazingly cinematographed action sequences, and even better, the high-impact action is nicely balanced out by a few tender moments &#150; making Saving Private Ryan more than just a war-themed action film.However, the whole mission of 'saving Private Ryan' &#150; for which our heroes risk their lives &#150; should've been justified more deeply, with more than just an Abraham Lincoln speech. And another thing that could've cleared up many misconceptions was the movie's name; Pvt. Ryan, despite being talked about throughout the movie, appears for like 15 minutes on screen, and even then has very little character development. Heck, the movie's tagline would've made for a more suitable title (The Mission is A Man). In fact, Pvt. Ryan is almost relegated to a minor character when it comes to screenplay, as the movie centers almost entirely around Tom Hanks' Capt. John Miller, who is also the most fleshed-out character in the movie &#150; perhaps the only one, in fact, but considering the movie's runtime, focusing on a few characters is a good thing.Like most others', my favorite scene from the movie was the Normandy beach landing at the beginning, which is one of the most intense sequences I've ever seen in a movie. If there is one vital thing that this scene would be incomplete without, it is the cinematography &#150; the shaky hand-held camera-work wonderfully evokes the feeling that the viewer is seeing the whole thing through the eyes of one of the soldiers fighting on the beach, and it leaves a very strong impression. There are also dramatic depictions of shell shock and tons of realistic hardcore gore, none of which feels gratuitous in context of the overall turbulence of the entire sequence. The sound is just as good, as gunshots and machine-gun fire booms loud and clear amidst frantic last cries, groans and screaming of soldiers.The cinematography, production design and acting are top-notch all across the board throughout the movie. Tom Hanks' performance is particularly moving and resonant. The cinematography is greatly helped by the 'handy-cam' style of camera-work and use of appropriately grayish color palettes. When it comes to the production design, destroyed villages and pastures look like they should, with dead rotting cows and all, while the piles of garbage that are found in abundance throughout the movie are also meticulously detailed, complete with chunks of 1940s-looking weaponry sticking out of them.All in all, Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war propaganda films ever made, if not the best (and I mean it positively) &#150; but my dilemma was right, it is still a propaganda film because according to this movie all Nazis are one-dimensional, motiveless and spineless, but considering how good the movie already is with its current premise, I couldn't really ask for more.

I remember watching this with my father when I was a kid, but it bored me to death, I didn't think it was scary at all. But I didn't want to write a movie comment on it until I could see it again as an adult. So I watched it this morning and I have a new look on this film, first off, I love the subtle history in these sci-fi films, I liked how the scientist that wanted to explore the alien looks Russian, and of course this was made during the cold war era, so as usual the Russian looking guy gets it. But this movie also stands out against other horror movies, it's one of the first horror movies that takes place in an isolated area, the cold and harsh weather of the North Pole. Granted, I'm still not scared of this film, but I definitely appreciate it a lot more now that I can see what The Thing from Another World was expressing to it's 1951 audience.A group of scientists in the North Pole have discovered a round ship underneath the ice, they thaw out the pilot. Still in ice, they take him back to their lab to melt the ice, but maybe that's not such a good idea since the pilot is a man killing alien from another world! He escapes the lab and starts the killing spree, the group gets together to take him down, but the bullets are failing and this thing will not stop until he's killed them all.Now I do recommend John Carpenter's remake, I think it had better character development vs. the original. But still there is something very special about The Thing from Another World, it's the first real sci-fi film that came out of the 50's, and is still very creepy. The scene where they set the alien on fire was definitely intense and scary to watch. The Thing from Another World is a great sci-fi classic that I'm sure any film lover could enjoy, I just wish I could go back in time and see this in the drive-in, lol.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 November 2008","score":"","review":" I'm on a little goal to see the sci-fi films from the 1950's, so The Thing from Another World was next on my list.

Now I'm onto The War of the Worlds, based off a radio broadcast by H.G. Wells that shocked the world. I did see the re-make by Steve Spielberg first before I saw the original, Spielberg's version is actually pretty decent, but despite it's cheesy effects, The War of the Worlds is a great classic that can still give anyone goosebumps. This was one of the more violent sci-fi movies, the aliens are not just after a group or a couple of people, but they mean to destroy the entire world. I love watching these old movies to get the feel of the time and how the cold war era effected a lot of the plots or characters of the sci-fi genre.After a meteor crash, a whole town is just shook up, after the meteor opens, the people are excited thinking this may be something incredible to learn about, maybe a creature from another world. Well it is, but they're not there to party with the humans, they're there to destroy the world. Trying to figure out how to stop these evil machines from killing off the entire world, more die as the others figure out they're at war with other worlds.The War of the Worlds is a good film, I know it's cheesy, but it's all good and you just have to think of the time set it was it, when you think about it, this is actually a brilliant film. I thought the most terrifying scene was when the first three men who go up to the alien thinking if they surrender that it'll all be good, but the machine lures over them and just kills them.
