Here he gets his first (of many) casts filled with famous actors in big or small roles, there are special effects that hold up surprisingly well (especially in the laboratory sketch), and Allen experiments with all sorts of gimmicks from all-Italian dialogue in one episode to black and white photography and intentionally bad picture quality in another.

Some of the sketches (including the notorious sheep one) are too one-joke even for their brief running times. However, the entire film is largely redeemed by the seventh and final episode, which takes us inside the brain - and body - of a man on a date; this sketch is so imaginative and daring that, once you've seen it, you'll never forget it; it ranks right up there with such classic bits of comedy as the cabin scene in A Night At The Opera. **1\/2 out of 4.

This is a fantastic film with top notch performances, stage design,atmosphere,music,and character development. I adore this movie almost as much as the original. I thought that soundtrack from Danny Elfman was even better this time around that it was in the original. He has outdone himself. Its intense, frightening, bittersweet, tragic and out of this world! Its quite a magnificent feat to behold. Michael Keaton is brilliant as The Caped Crusader. He is a total Badass and doesn't seem to be afraid of anything. He is a quiet intellectual who can work his way out of problems that no one else could even dream of. He gets himself into trouble in this movie and we are reminded that Batman is still a human like the rest of his and is not invulnerable. The film's art direction is just as dark as it was in Batman but this time its much more Gothic and Halloween like. This film's tone shifts quite a lot. It is quite a mouthful but never becomes crowded or overbearing. There are moments when the film is very somber and bittersweet and their are moments when the film is bizarre and disturbing. All of these moments are handled brilliantly in the film and so are the characters. This was an incredible important film in Batman cinema history. It introduced the two villain per film formula that every Batman film proceeding this would Imitate. To say that Michelle Pfieffer played Catwoman would be almost rhetorical and perhaps the understatement of the century. She was The Freaking Catwoman! We meet Selina Kyle before she becomes cat-woman. This film does a masterful job of making audience understand the character and her pain and Isolation. Her transformation from Mousy Secretary to fierce feline is Brilliant, memorizing, and Unforgettable. The scene when Selina Kyle trashes her apartment is heartbreaking yet we also feel a catharsis and a sense of release with her. The scene is unnerving and hard to watch but it makes perfect sense for the character. When She becomes Catowmen she is sexy, and frankly quite scary. I absolutely loved Pfieffer's cat-woman. She keeps you on your toes the entire ride and it is a riot to watch her go at it with Batman or embark on random rampages. I thought Danny Devito gave a performance of a lifetime as The Penguin. His performance will most likely never be rivaled or surpassed. He was an animal. He scared the daylights out of me as a child when He bite that man's nose off. I loved every line of dialog that came out of his mouth. He was truly menacing and disappeared into the character. The makeup for The Penguin was freaking awesome. The character's story was classic and beautifully told in a way that I have never seen before. Its easily the best role that I have ever seen Danny Devito in. Christopher Walken was great as Max Schrek. A power hungry bully that wants to control all of Gotham's energy with a power-plant that will actually steal power from Gotham. This movie is a rare Gem that will delight and memorize audiences for years to come. Due to its impeccable writing, excellent characters and haunting atmosphere. It is an absolute Marvel of a film!

Elvira shows up in the small town where many of the old-fashioned locals look down on her but even worse is the fact that this old house contains a recipe book, which brings with it all sorts of spells and monsters. I've never been a fan of horror hosts and I never was a fan of Elvira so I really wasn't sure what to expect from this film. I had heard many negative things about this over the years and while the film is pretty bad it also has a certain charm that keeps it somewhat watchable. The entire screenplay is bizarre to say the least because it's never quite sure what type of film it wants to be. I say this because it's kept kid friendly but at the same time you've got all sorts of strange sexual talk that really stands out because you're not expecting to hear it in a movie like this and when you do hear it, it just stands out from everything else going on. All the boob jokes aimed at Elvira is expected and I think a good argument could be made that the film producers would have been much better served had the film gone for a tad bit darker and more adult natured film. The horror elements are all rather weak but I think fans of the genre will get a few smiles out of seeing some cult movies shown here including IT CONQUERED THE WORLD and ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOS. There's also a pretty funny joke involving the first potion that Elvira cooks out. As for Peterson, I'd be lying if I said she gave a good performance but she is good at the character she created and there's no question she can play the part well. The supporting players are all good in their parts but no one really stands out and takes over the film.

The first half of the film follows the angles of poor boy falls in love with the rich girl, and the forbidden relationship that causes the poor boy and rich girl to flee the old country. The second half is the story of the struggles of the young couple trying to settle in a new land. Yes, it's a little bit dramatic at times, and it has the foundations of a good, well-told story, but only when played right without being over the top. Nicole Kidman did a lovely job, and she made the role of Shannon her own; she was really believable. Thomas Gibson's portrayal of Stephen, the main antagonist, was just brilliant. He excellently played that kind of bad guy viewers really just love to hate! The cinematography was beautiful, as was the sweeping views of the Land Rush. Ron Howard did a great job in showing the audience an epic drama.On the downside, I could not get over the film's end conflict Joseph (Tom Cruise) was supposed to die, right? He fights Stephen in a big showdown, falls and gets trampled by horses, and he hits his head hard on a rock, which looked like it should have been fatal. Joseph fades out, and Shannon weeps. Yet, he miraculously springs back to life because Shannon tells Joseph that she loves him? What? That ending is over the top, and a little too absurdly overdone for my tastes. Another thing, although it's minor the name of Nicole Kidman's character. The name Shannon just sounds a little too modern for the 1890's, sort of like having a girl being named Courtney in a movie set in the Civil War. Finally, I tried very hard, but still could not get past Joseph's accent. That was a huge minus for me; to me, Joseph sounded more like Forrest Gump than a poor Irish lad. Sorry Tom, you were much more believable as Maverick on Top Gun! Nonetheless, it was still a good film that's worth watching.

I grew up with this movie and it will always have a special place in my heart. I am aware of the 60s comedy series but This is first real definitive Batman film. Tim Burton crafted a cerebral film that draws you in due to its setting and atmosphere. The Characters are fascinating and the performances do a perfect job of capturing the complexity and these iconic characters. The cinematography is flawless and so is the direction. Everything about this movie just screams Batman and its freaking Epic. There is a scene at the beginning of the film When two goons are talking about their fear of the Bat just before The Caped Crusader himself gracefully glides down a few feet behind them in the distance. The elegant and eerie music that kicks in during this memorable scene from the film gives me goosebumps every time I see it. Danny Elfman's score captures the awe and majesty of The Dark Knight in a unique way that no other score ever could. I can listen to it over and over again and be moved by it. The score is inspiring, genius, intense, blood pumping, exhilarating, and just plain awesome. It becomes part of the world of Gotham city that audiences remember the most. Gotham is dark, brooding and a very fearful place. Tim Burton does an amazing job of making the audiences believe that this city need a symbol of hope like Batman. Someone who is just as if no more elemental and terrifying as the criminals that he is up against. The character of Bruce Wayne\/Batman is presented Masterfully in this picture. He is mysterious and hides in the shadows for the most of the picture. This makes his appearances all the more meaningful for this film and exciting. His dramatic entrances are the best. The costume looks great and so does the bat-mobile and all of Bruce's gadgets. I absolutely loved Michael Keaton's Interpreataion of the character. As Bruce Wayne he is nerdy and unsure of himself. He can't overcome his inner demons by being Bruce Wayne. Bruce surrounds himself with so much exotic images in order to illustrate this. He is a man of few words who is unable to express himself. When he is Batman his attitude chances. He becomes a man of action who by dawning the symbol of a demon is able to vanquish them. The incredible visuals speak volumes about what the symbol of the Bat does for Bruce. It makes him stronger and it becomes shocking how good Keaton's acting is. His performances is magnificent. Kim Bassinger is great and underrated as Vicky Vale. She is a loving and sweet person. She probably the most normal person in the film which is much needed considering how crazy and fantastic all the other characters are. She is a reporter who wants to learn more about Batman and mostly about Bruce Wayne. I love the angle Burton went with her character. She isn't some shallow hotty who has the hot for Batman because he is the cool bad-boy in town like in Batman Forever(sorry Nicole Kidman). Time is well spent developing the relationship between her and Bruce and she it is clear that she genuinely cares for him. Vicky screams a lot and is clearly a damsel is distress but that doesn't mean she doesn't have courage. She follows Bruce into the darkest corners of his life and his brave enough to deal with the consequences. Jack Nicolson was born to play The Joker.He gives the best performance in the movie. He is absolutely amazing proving that The Joker is a difficult role to mess up. He is an incredibly goofy villain but not merely for the sake of it like Jim Carry and Tommy lee Jones in Batman Forever. Jack is no a comedian. He is an actor. He infuses his performance with a tint of malice and a psychotic outbreak in all the scenes with him laughing like a clown. He is a very creepy villain but also a very entertaining one.His fixed smile is brilliant and disturbing and his laughter is positively chilling. This movie has some great action scenes and set pieces but takes this film to the next level is depth and intrigue of the characters.

Basically puny and uncoordinated Marvin Mange (Razzie nominated Rob Schneider) has dreamt all his life of being a police officer like his father, but while he can't achieve this and pass the obstacle course he is a trainee in the local small town police station, and Sergeant Sisk (John C. McGinley) continues to pick on him. One day alone at the station he receives an emergency call about a robbery, and with all the officers at a softball game he decides to answer the call and rush to the scene of the crime himself, but while driving he swerves to avoid hitting a seal on the road, and this causes him to roll down the many hills below until he crashes to the ground with a broken body. Critically injured Marvin was rescued out of the wreckage by mad scientist Dr. Wilder (Michael Caton) who puts his body back together with the help of numerous animals parts, and days later he wakes up with not much recollection of what happened, and he finds that he can run faster than a horse, he can scare off mean dogs, and he no longer requires his asthma medicine, he wrongly assumes this is all due to the advertised badger milk he bought. While at the park while walking her dogs, Marvin meets animal shelter owner Rianna (Colleen Haskell), and he is instantly attracted to her, and his newfound animal instincts are taking over, so he cannot help catching a Frisbee in his mouth thrown by a man, then after seeing his airport security guard friend Miles (Guy Torry) to talk about his problem he finds the uncanny ability to sniff out drugs from a man's rectum. Marvin, praised as a hero catching a drug smuggler, is happy to be promoted to being a full-fledged police officer, but his animal behaviour is becoming slowly more and more strong, he even starts waking up in strange places with no memory of what he was doing, and he has been hearing about some kind of beast attacks occurring, and he assumes it is him. Dr. Wilder approaches Marvin and explains everything about his experiment and how he believes the animal instincts have had problematic side effects and his subject will become uncontrollable, but Marvin shuns this and wants carry on with his newfound status. He does find it difficult to control himself as time passes by, including persuading Riana to go to dinner with him, and during the evening he has to excuse himself while he feels the urges like a horse to make love, but he settles himself and ends the evening with a simple kiss and a promise to see her again soon. Later he attends a party held by the Mayor (Scott Wilson), and this is where his behaviour becomes crazy when he chases a cat like a dog and destroys things his path, this causes him to get fired, but he saves himself after saving the Mayor's son who he heard fall into the near lake and almost drown, combining the abilities of a seal and a dolphin, and he is instantly reinstated. Chief Wilson (Edward Asner) questions Marvin about the night time attacks by the reported beast, and a witness sketch looks very much like him, so he hides himself in his garage with a big dam like a beaver bolting the door, and Rianna finds this when she comes to see him, and they spend the night together, he tied him up to stop any possible attack he may make, but she untied him while he was asleep. Soon enough the police show up and pull down the barricade to possibly arrest Marvin, he runs away and heads for the woods, and the officers and an angry mob are there to catch him, but Dr. Wilder reveals that he had another patient who underwent the same crazy experiment and is actually the beast, it is Rianna. When the mob are about to punish one of the two culprits in the middle of their circle, Miles claims that it was him, because he believes that if black people do anything wrong no-one bats an eyelid and forgets everything, because they don't want to be racist, and this is exactly the case, and the whole thing let go by the police and mob. In the end Marvin and Rianna are happy together when they get married and give birth to a few children with the same abilities that they share, on television Dr. Wilder is seen winning the Nobel Peace Prize and revealing his new fiancée as the female co-presenter of the badger milk adverts, and big scars are seen on her back suggesting that the doctor has experimented on her as well. Also starring Louis Lombardi as Fatty, Adam Sandler as Townie, Family Guy's Norm MacDonald as Mob Member, Pete as Dimples the Dog, Bliss as Nelly the Goat, Kanoozi as Mr. Giggles and Louey as Henry the Orangutan. I will admit that I did laugh at a few bits of this film and found a fair bit of it a guilty pleasure, but ultimately I knew that the performance by Schneider was silly, the story was ridiculous and full of stupid, gross and inappropriate material, including bestiality and mild racism, so all in all I couldn't escape the feeling that this film was a terrible comedy.

One day alone at the station he receives an emergency call about a robbery, and with all the officers at a softball game he decides to answer the call and rush to the scene of the crime himself, but while driving he swerves to avoid hitting a seal on the road, and this causes him to roll down the many hills below until he crashes to the ground with a broken body. Critically injured Marvin was rescued out of the wreckage by mad scientist Dr. Wilder (Michael Caton) who puts his body back together with the help of numerous animals parts, and days later he wakes up with not much recollection of what happened, and he finds that he can run faster than a horse, he can scare off mean dogs, and he no longer requires his asthma medicine, he wrongly assumes this is all due to the advertised badger milk he bought. While at the park while walking her dogs, Marvin meets animal shelter owner Rianna (Colleen Haskell), and he is instantly attracted to her, and his newfound animal instincts are taking over, so he cannot help catching a Frisbee in his mouth thrown by a man, then after seeing his airport security guard friend Miles (Guy Torry) to talk about his problem he finds the uncanny ability to sniff out drugs from a man's rectum. Marvin, praised as a hero catching a drug smuggler, is happy to be promoted to being a full-fledged police officer, but his animal behaviour is becoming slowly more and more strong, he even starts waking up in strange places with no memory of what he was doing, and he has been hearing about some kind of beast attacks occurring, and he assumes it is him. Dr. Wilder approaches Marvin and explains everything about his experiment and how he believes the animal instincts have had problematic side effects and his subject will become uncontrollable, but Marvin shuns this and wants carry on with his newfound status. He does find it difficult to control himself as time passes by, including persuading Riana to go to dinner with him, and during the evening he has to excuse himself while he feels the urges like a horse to make love, but he settles himself and ends the evening with a simple kiss and a promise to see her again soon. Later he attends a party held by the Mayor (Scott Wilson), and this is where his behaviour becomes crazy when he chases a cat like a dog and destroys things his path, this causes him to get fired, but he saves himself after saving the Mayor's son who he heard fall into the near lake and almost drown, combining the abilities of a seal and a dolphin, and he is instantly reinstated. Chief Wilson (Edward Asner) questions Marvin about the night time attacks by the reported beast, and a witness sketch looks very much like him, so he hides himself in his garage with a big dam like a beaver bolting the door, and Rianna finds this when she comes to see him, and they spend the night together, he tied him up to stop any possible attack he may make, but she untied him while he was asleep. Soon enough the police show up and pull down the barricade to possibly arrest Marvin, he runs away and heads for the woods, and the officers and an angry mob are there to catch him, but Dr. Wilder reveals that he had another patient who underwent the same crazy experiment and is actually the beast, it is Rianna. When the mob are about to punish one of the two culprits in the middle of their circle, Miles claims that it was him, because he believes that if black people do anything wrong no-one bats an eyelid and forgets everything, because they don't want to be racist, and this is exactly the case, and the whole thing let go by the police and mob. In the end Marvin and Rianna are happy together when they get married and give birth to a few children with the same abilities that they share, on television Dr. Wilder is seen winning the Nobel Peace Prize and revealing his new fiancée as the female co-presenter of the badger milk adverts, and big scars are seen on her back suggesting that the doctor has experimented on her as well. Also starring Louis Lombardi as Fatty, Adam Sandler as Townie, Family Guy's Norm MacDonald as Mob Member, Pete as Dimples the Dog, Bliss as Nelly the Goat, Kanoozi as Mr. Giggles and Louey as Henry the Orangutan. I will admit that I did laugh at a few bits of this film and found a fair bit of it a guilty pleasure, but ultimately I knew that the performance by Schneider was silly, the story was ridiculous and full of stupid, gross and inappropriate material, including bestiality and mild racism, so all in all I couldn't escape the feeling that this film was a terrible comedy.

Michael, Jason, and Freddy had lost their touch. They were battling psychics, going to New York, and all sorts of weird stories that went completely against what the franchises built themselves on. Wes Craven had some luck with with New Nightmare, a meta return to the franchise he built. But it was this movie that really rebuilt the genre and brought it back to glory.The movie is about a group of horror movie buffs who find themselves in a horror movie. Much like the original Friday the 13th, there is a mystery as to who the killer(s) is. It focuses on Sidney, the incredibly sexy Neve Campbell, whose mother was killed a year before and learns how she is tied to the killings. They are all aware of the movies this film references.New Nightmare may have been the first, but Scream was the first to popularize the idea of self-aware characters. Any movie buff will recognize the references (Halloween, Friday the 13th, Prom Night, etc) beyond those the movie directly references. The movie is a love letter to the genre and will make film buffs out of anyone. I know this movie is probably the reason I'm such a film buff, particularly of horror movies, myself.I love that the movie is a mystery. There's so few horror movies that include mystery aspects. The original Friday the 13th tried it, but Ms. Voorhees came out of nowhere. Prom Night did it, but the killer was pretty obvious. This is very much like an Agatha Christie story. The suspects are all there, and they're all guilty until they're gutted or the mask is taken off. The reveal is quite satisfying. Their motivation is fitting. Screams 3 and 4 would be disappointing, but this one was really good. And the movie just gets better with multiple viewings so you can see new layers to the real killer throughout the movie.The cast is good. Campbell looks great and is a great heroine along the lines of Alien's Ripley. McGowan isn't just a dumb, horny blonde. Cox proves she isn't just her Friends character. Arquette is hilarious. Though it's Lillard and Kennedy who steal the movie. The two are terrific and hilarious in every scene they're in, especially the Rules of Horror scene. My only complaint is that Ulrich looks a little too evil, though he otherwise does a great job. They all are convincing as high school students.Of course, what really makes this movie great is the frights. This is an incredibly effective scary movie. Like all the best slasher films, this one relies on suspense over gore. There's plenty of blood, but it's the build up to the kills that really scare people. The opening scene is probably one of the best in the genre. Anyone can make a person jump and enough gore will gross even those with the best stomachs, but suspense is the best way to really scare someone. The movie really spends the time to make you care about the characters, so when their time comes you're actually rooting for them rather than the killer, the main problem with later Friday the 13th films. This is one that will have you hiding behind blankets and pillows on your first watch.The movie's use of cell phones may date the film somewhat, but Scream is a terrific film otherwise. The movie knows the genre and is one of the best of it. This is a can't miss for any horror fan, and will likely make some new fans.

It's a bit dark for that age, but it was a Disney film, so my parents took me to the screening. I have to say, it left me breathless! Even though it was difficult for me to comprehend the whole story, still I was able to follow the basic plot! And what really enchanted me was the incredibly powerful music! The soundtrack is one of the darkest and most surrounding soundtracks I have ever heard! Disney generally has high quality soundtracks, but what makes this different is that it's not meant for children. It's not happy and cheerful, it has something bittersweet and dangerous. And matches with the pictures and story perfectly! The art is beautiful too, and the Notre Dame looks so real! I've read the book twice, but I still find the film enjoyable and full of feelings! It is one of the really great Disney movies (plot-music-art combination) and I think you should watch it as if you didn't know anything about the book.

The atmosphere and setup comes in on the same lines as The Exorcist though it is just dealt from the opposite perspective. It is quite audacious for its time to have the main antagonist of the movie to be a 8 year old kid.Robert Thorn (Gregory Peck) is a diplomat assuming the role of an Ambassador to different countries on behalf of the U.S. government. When he was assigned in Italy, his wife Katherine (Lee Remick) delivers a stillborn, the head priest of the hospital offers a just born whose mother dies at child birth and keeps this truth from Katherine. After some strange events and his talk with a persistent priest about their child being an Antichrist, he tries to get to the bottom of this with the help of a photographer who seemed to have recorded some of these strange events.When I first saw a snippet of this movie on TV, I was thrilled; especially the scene where the nanny commits suicide during a birthday party. It felt raw and intriguing at the same time. Gregory Peck does an excellent job as a practical person unable to make sense to the accusations on his child, either by his wife or the priest. The writers include some thrilling moments like the attack by dogs at the cemetery to go along with the investigative mode the story takes upon. The background score is intense though a bit loud. Billie Whitelaw plays the role of a nanny who is like an apostle to help the Antichrist gives a stage like performance which could have been a lot better without her closeup weird looks. Screenplay and editing is neat but the end felt a bit too hasty to wrap things up. The kid though actually doesn't do any acting has the perfect look of both sweet and mischief.More a good thriller movie than a horror one. Fun to watch nevertheless.
