Yes everything looks so fake and yes the buildings are models and yes it's a guy in a suit but you know, so what? These are the special effects for the time and just as I complain about the latest Hollywood blockbuster these days and how in some other films the special effects are terrible, Godzilla's may look a little rough now but the un-real elements in this film do not detract from its experience nor do they ever take centre stage above the narrative or the themes within. Godzilla is a focused film; a film that is structured around an idea that is bold and outgoing whilst simultaneously making a statement about the world at the time of production. Godzilla retains a certain charm and a certain quality that never makes it uninteresting and surely that means it can only be labelled as a success.We've all seen the American remake and all had our opinions on it. I may have liked it as a child as a fast moving, good looking epic but thinking back, it makes the mistakes toward the end that its Japanese original and inspiration does not and that is allowing the special effects to take control of your picture. By the time what's-his-name and who's-it are in that subway station fending off Godzilla's young in a blatant attempt to recreate the kitchen scene out of Spielberg's Jurassic Park, you've accepted the film has gone down a certain disappointing route. But here I feel the scenes involving the special effects are really just the result of good film-making prior to it all happening. There is the introduction of the monster; the keeping the monster away from the screen; the presenting of the monster but not as a destructive creature; the dialogue building the monster up off-screen and then the carnage that is what Godzilla is capable of now that he's reached that level of destruction.I feel that despite the film being considerably large for its time, the people that made it probably never envisaged it becoming as successful as it did. The film has spawned sequels, prequels, spin-offs and even a remake forty years after the initial production. Hollywood were perhaps familiar with the concept of this big-budget, special effects extravaganza involving a giant monster following 1933's King Kong and were perhaps more used to this genre by the time they'd seen Gojira. But if the rumour that people were running from the cinemas following King Kong are true then I wonder what Ishirô Honda and Shigeru Kayama exactly had in mind before this was released. I think the emphasis was always on delivering a film with an intriguing story and one with some sort of eerie message at its centre, much unlike today's extravaganzas and perhaps a lot less than 1933's King Kong although the message nearer the end could echo along the lines of 'Just what exactly consists of entertainment these days?' But it's not Honda and Kayama's fault this is as big as it is today and it's not their fault I saw this on a DVD disc free with a newspaper, complete with huge build up from a preceding television advert, right here in the year 2008. Godzilla may be a film that is a guy in a suit tearing down models of dodgy looking buildings whilst breathing some sort of fire rendering him more ancient, mythical dragon than deep sea lizard but it works in its own way. The film is a folklore story from ancient times, re-surfacing (no pun intended) into modern times through, what the characters deem to be, the lack of attention and acknowledgement to times gone by. It could be true that the legend that is Gojira is angry at the lack of sacrifice or food or whatever it was and he has come to wreck and nasty revenge or it could be a statement on Japan's ever growing modernity that, by now we all know, is the best in the world when it comes to stereo systems, gadgets and gizmos. I don't think the producers were threatening people with a giant lizard that will come from the sea and destroy us but the ruined Tokyo shots are probably metaphors for the falling apart of society if Japan itself looses focus of who they actually are and buckles under the immense pressures of 20th Century modernising.Then there are the plot elements that declare Godzilla the result of nuclear testing. World War Two had ended a mere nine years ago, ironically in the Pacific with the dropping of Big and Little Boy, respectively. Look what the nuclear blasts have done to us; look at the moral decision we now face we must rebuild and get going again, but at what cost? No, a lizard won't come from the deep and destroy everything again but if we fall behind then Japan will never once again be a great nation. These are the questions and ideas I think Gojira raises given its timeframe. Then there is the lack of international support offered when Godzilla goes nuts, another statement on Japan's global position and relationship with other world powers following the war? Perhaps. The real-life images of Tokyo decimated from bombing adds to the reality Japan faced and the use of the special effects is smart it's always model attacking model, not model attacking 'real' like America usually do it today and sometimes in 1933's King Kong. One of the reasons I thought Jackson's was better is because his is CGI fighting CGI. Gojira may borrow from Hollywood's story-telling regarding the morale choice and the 2nd Revelation but the film remains an entertaining and fascinating one all the same.

This is one of the movies that helped get me into all the comic book stuff when I was in my early teens. Well, the character of Spider-Man anyway. Now, six years on, Spider-Man is one of my favourite comic book characters and Stan Lee is one of my heroes. It gives a really good origin story in the beginning that stays pretty true to the comics for the most part. Sure there were changes made to the story in some parts, but it was still pretty close. The origin carries into a pretty solid plot, which really works as a Spider-Man movie.The acting was really good, and I felt the actors all portrayed their characters well. I thought that Tobey Macguire made a really good Peter Parker and a decent Spider-Man, James Franco was really good as Harry Osborne, and I think I'm one of the few people that thinks Kirsten Dunst made an alright Mary Jane Watson. They all had great chemistry together. You could really imagine that Mary Jane was the girl that Peter loved, and that Harry was his best friend. The father\/son relationship between Harry and Norman Osborne was pretty believable. All the actors just worked really well together, and I believe good chemistry works really well toward making a good movie. Even the supporting characters are perfectly cast, like Uncle Ben, Aunt May, J Jonah Jameson and Betty Brant seemed as if they were straight out of the comics.The storyline is pretty cool. It's filled with lots of drama, when you get to see Peter feeling different things throughout the movie. Guilt, love, confusion. You get to see the transformation of a nerdy, weak teenager into a powerful hero. It's not just about some kid who gets bitten by a spider and becomes a superhero, it's got a whole lot more depth than that. And for the most part, the actual storyline doesn't just feel like filler until the next action scene. That's part of what sets it apart from a lot of other comic book movies. Some of the dialog in the movie is a bit cheesy, especially some of the stuff between Peter and Mary Jane, but I don't really let it bug me. The action scenes are really good, although a little fleeting for the most part. They just seemed over too soon sometimes. They were still really cool though, and were definitely some of the high points of the movie. The costume designs are really good as well. The Spider-Man costume looks awesome in about 132 different ways. Apparently the changes that were made to the Green Goblin costume in comparison to his comic counterpart caused some problems with fans. I think the changes were necessary to avoid being too cheesy. And his new costume looked awesome anyway. The special effects in the movie were pretty good, especially in scenes where Spidey is swinging around. There are some scenes where it does look a little fake, but it shouldn't take away from the movie for people. But I know people do like to whine about every problems in movies, so some people might find the effects an issue.All in all, it's an awesome movie, and we were lucky enough to get two sequels to it. I've watched it a few times, and it holds up well. A fairly re-watchable movie. It was one of the movies that helped start the modern Marvel movie trend, along with X-Men and the Blade movies before it. Just another great thing it had a hand in. Sam Raimi is a great director. Spider-Man is a great character and was really done justice in a movie that could have easily been awful.

It definitely isn't.From memory (it's been a few years since I saw it on network TV) it also 'parodies' other movies of around the time, like I know what you did last summer. Can't really remember too much about it...it's more a narrative movie than the latter sketch comedy movies in this franchise. In any case, if you've seen Scream, you'll know how this movie plays out, but it will just have a more lowest common denominator sense of humour to it.Even though I did find this movie a dud (glad I didn't pay to see it!), I do recommend the sequel-the second one I think, which parodies such movies as The Exorcist. That one, especially, really marked the high water mark for these comedy makers.Not sure how many of this franchise I've seen afterwards...I do know that I saw the last cinema release (Scary Movie 4) and was again disappointed by the Wayans' efforts.

Please, if you value the hours of your life, do not ever watch Jan de Bont's bowdlerised 1999 remake of this classic. This version, made by the late, great Robert Wise, is all about atmosphere, and what atmosphere - a sense of mounting oppression and dread that will remain with any imaginative viewer long after the film is over. There is one particular scene which remains imprinted on my memory from my first viewing of The Haunting when I was a child. It's the scene where the camera focuses on the wallpaper. Doesn't sound scary, does it? Well, watch it and see.The cinematography, by Davis Boulton, is an essential factor in what makes this movie work, and he makes the most of the house's dark corridors and omnipresent shadows. Add to this impressive and striking camera work and subtle but terrifying sound and visual effects and you have an unforgettable cinematic experience. The screenplay, by Nelson Gidding, is faithful to Shirley Jackson's novel, and the cast is an unusual but effective mixture of character actors, one musical star and great actresses such as Julie Harris and Claire Bloom. Enjoy Valentine Dyall's amusingly surly and monosyllabic turn as Mr. Dudley, the caretaker, not forgetting Rosalie Crutchley's entertainingly ghoulish performance as his wife, the housekeeper who takes a perverse pleasure out of trying to give Julie Harris's character the willies.You might have been told by some people not to watch this film alone. Don't listen to them. The best circumstances for viewing The Haunting are to watch it at night, completely alone, with all the lights off.

The opening sequence is set to Jack Nitzsche's Hard Workin' Man, introducing blues music to us right off the bat, music that not only makes up basically all of the music in this film but can be seen as a motif or even a character in the film. It's amazing how confident and mature Paul Schrader is as a director at this point. Of course, Schrader had already written the massively acclaimed Taxi Driver by 1978, but contrary to what one might expect it's his confident and sure handling of the pace and mood in Blue Collar that is truly the highlight of the film, not the screenplay penned by Paul and Leonard Schrader, granted the screenplay is in itself quite terrific. Schrader is already a mature director who understands the rhythm of a film.Going back to the use of music in this film, it isn't so much the score itself by Jack Nitzsche (which is, don't get me wrong, solid blues) that's impressive, it's Schrader's handling of the music and sound in general in this film that makes it work so well. First off, the choice to go with a blues score is inspired in itself, as the nature of the music so perfectly captures what these characters are going through. In addition, the score is most noticeable during scenes where the film appears to be commenting on the futility of the characters' struggle and the misery of what they're going through. Where many films would use music to 'enhance' big, dramatic scenes, Schrader's Blue Collar makes the wise decision to use it during low-key scenes. There are several scenes that don't feature any music at all, these being some of the more important scenes. Note the scene where Smokey gets trapped in the paint room, absolutely no music, just the cold sound of the machinery (expertly mixed, might I add), which is far creepier and more effective than any score could be at that point. Similar use of sound occurs a few minutes before the end when Harvey Keitel's character Jerry is being chased.The acting here is uniformly superb with Keitel possibly giving his best performance (or at least one of them), and Richard Pryor offering what must be recognized as one of the finest performances of the 70's by anyone. Really, who knew Pryor had this sort of skill when it comes to dramatic acting? Yapphet Koto, a beloved character actor, does a fine job in rounding out the cast for the main three characters. Again, Schrader must be credited for directing his actors so well. It's well-known, of course, that the three leads hated each other and actually broke out in fistfights between takes on occasion. Perhaps that created a sort of demented chemistry between them.The screenplay by Schrader and Schrader (Paul and Leonard) is a fine, fine piece of writing, sort of the daytime factory-worker version of the crude-yet-poetic Taxi Driver screenplay. Oddly enough, it's also the source of the few major flaws in this film, as it can come across as fairly heavy-handed in certain scenes. If there's one thing I'd definitely do differently with this film, it's the final shot, which would have been terrific had this been a comedy.All in all, a great film in its own right and especially impressive as a directorial debut from Schrader.

Yes, there are countless things(and this has many) to pick at, some downright cringe-inducing. But if you look at them, and try to choose the best parts, I would say that this fits my summary... for the new ones, of course. And we must decide by some system how viewable these are, because, let's face it... an awful lot of us are going to sit down and take them in, in spite of not expecting to be as into them as the OT(original... yeah), and knowing that we won't really be. My two cents? This is the most overall entertaining and re-watchable of the PT. As far as thrilling and fun light-saber swordplay, choreography, execution(in fact, of all six), yup, the best, all the way. The action, in general, receives top marks, as well. The villain... do I need to describe its awesomeness? If you have no idea what I mean, you probably haven't seen the film. The score... magnificent. There are beautiful images in this. But yes, there are awful moments herein... you've likely at least heard of them. The comedy takes a bit of a dive, with more than one piece of toilet humor(and there's a reason the slapstick isn't that popular, although there are exceptions). The acting could be better, but that goes for most of Star Wars(be honest now, people)(meanwhile, Neeson... wonderfully cast). Character writing, especially for the leads, could be more fresh for the franchise. The plot isn't bad, and develops reasonably. The pacing is adequate. The effects are pretty spectacular, if not always real-looking, but it only gets worse in the latter area, and some practical ones are still used here.

So, when a friend lent me his DVD, I just had to have another look.The idea that underpins the story is original what would and could happen if, by a stroke of bad luck, a person should begin to shrink from adult size? Matheson developed that idea into a gripping story, which I recall well, and from there a powerful script. Jack Arnold then directed a work that still stands the test of time, despite the wizardry of today's CGI and other special effects.The standout, however, is the acting from Grant Williams (as Scott Carey) who carries the film for almost two-thirds, with voice-over narration, as he battles to stay alive while he continues to shrink. In sequence, Scott narrowly escapes being eaten by his house cat, falls into the home's basement where he remains trapped, tussles with a large spider, almost drowns when water overflows from a water tub, and just misses being squashed flat by his now-giant brother Charlie (Paul Langton) who can't hear Scott's diminutive voice screaming at him for help; nor can Scott's wife, Louise (Randy Stuart), as she stands on the basement stairs asking Charlie to bring her suitcase upstairs.Both think that Scott was killed by the house cat anyway&#133;a delightful irony that is captured beautifully by Arnold. Every time you see a cat cleaning its paws, you'll think of that scene. At least, I do.The story continues until Scott shrinks to the point where he can finally fit through the wire mesh on the basement window&#133; to escape to a new &#150; but old &#150; world for him to discover and, it's implied, to conquer the world of the infinitesimal. Facing that new experience, Scott then waxes poetically as he sets off to make and meet his fate, an ending that I'm sure was constructed for the movie audience of the day. The ending in the novel, as I recall, was not nearly as saccharine or saintly, however.This movie comes from a long line of sci-fi films of the 1950s Jack Arnold was also responsible for It Came from Outer Space (1953), Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954), Revenge of the Creature (1955), and Tarantula (1955). By 1951, Howard Hawks had already terrified us with The Thing from Another World, Gene Barry shot to stardom in The War of the Worlds (1953), while in 1958, even Steve McQueen got into the act when he battled The Blob (1958).All of those films had the common theme of fear of the unknown, the fear of difference and the fear of insignificance &#150; all fears that seemed to plague the citizens of USA during the scares of the Cold War and the UFO experience at that time.Shrinking Man is then not just a sci-fi scare movie. I think it could also double as a metaphor &#150; way ahead of its time &#150; for that personal diminution of power and significance, in the face of Soviet aggression and the threat of nuclear war. Whether that was Matheson's intent, I don't know.When compared to those films above, and others at the time, one thing is certain this film has the best use of split-screen and superimposition of frames, coupled with very clever perspectives, all to provide the illusion of a tiny Scott in a gigantic world. It's a masterpiece of filming and editing and should be seen for those effects alone, if not for the story.By today's standards, it's not slash and gore terror, nor creepy-crawly thriller it's a brilliant adventure story, with a sci-fi premise, that extols the virtues of courage, self-reliance and independence, in the face of almost overwhelming adversity.

More than the horror of war alone, the current crop of films about Vietnam depicts the conflict as an exercise in futility. Whether Vietnam technically qualifies as a war is now academic, but for the men who fought and died in it, Vietnam was a war&#151;unconventional and without glory. In Thunderbolt & Lightfoot director Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter, with Robert De Niro, three young Americans volunteer for the adventure of combat in Southeast Asia in the late 1960s as an alternative to the humdrum oblivion of life in a Northern mill town. The nightmare that they plunge themselves into when they Vietnam is a descent into chaos from which they never recover.The plot of The Deer Hunter is both epic and episodic. The first half of this 182-minute epic concerns the characters before they embark for the 'Nam.' They live in a small town whose activities revolve around a steel mill. About the only pastimes they can revel in are boozing at a friend's bar and hunting. The second half occurs in Vietnam. They are captured, escape, and return to civilian life, with mental and physical scars that they cannot conquer. Sadly, the filmmakers have had to pare down their mini-series plot to accommodate the two to three hour running time. Some scenes wear out their welcome. The wedding, for example, is a grandiose spectacle in an awesome church. But Cimino wallows in the spectacle of the wedding to excess. Indeed, the ceremony is as interesting as its setting is magnificent, but it does little to advance the plot. The entire wedding ceremony qualifies as the chick flick part of this war film.Never does Cimino foreshadow his transitions. The changes of locale from America to Vietnam and from combat to capture are distressingly abrupt. The Deer Hunter emerges as an uneven, series of loosely strung together scenes that are more powerful than their overall design. At times, too, the symbolism is so obvious as to be corny. During the wedding, John Savage and Meryl Streep drink a toast to their marriage. If they drink without spilling a drop, they will have good luck. In a close-up, we see an unnoticed fleck of wine stain her dress. Other scenes seem unconsciously funny. Michael (Robert De Niro), the hero of the movie, who is the The Deer Hunter of the title, is shown in a hunting scene stalking a deer. He edges up on one side of the slope framed by majestic mountains and raises his rifle. The camera pans to reveal a deer poised not far off as proudly as the deer in the Hartford Insurance commercial. If that isn't sufficient, the music behind the scene is a heavenly choir that celebrates the relationship of De Niro to the deer in the game of the hunt, a solemn heroic act. How pretentious!Director Michael Cimino does direct The Deer Hunter with verve. They early mill town scenes have gusto galore, and the setting of the film is solidly established by the era's popular music.

More than the horror of war alone, the current crop of films about Vietnam depicts the conflict as an exercise in futility. Whether Vietnam technically qualifies as a war is now academic, but for the men who fought and died in it, Vietnam was a war&#151;unconventional and without glory. In Thunderbolt & Lightfoot director Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter, with Robert De Niro, three young Americans volunteer for the adventure of combat in Southeast Asia in the late 1960s as an alternative to the humdrum oblivion of life in a Northern mill town. The nightmare that they plunge themselves into when they Vietnam is a descent into chaos from which they never recover.The plot of The Deer Hunter is both epic and episodic. The first half of this 182-minute epic concerns the characters before they embark for the 'Nam.' They live in a small town whose activities revolve around a steel mill. About the only pastimes they can revel in are boozing at a friend's bar and hunting. The second half occurs in Vietnam. They are captured, escape, and return to civilian life, with mental and physical scars that they cannot conquer. Sadly, the filmmakers have had to pare down their mini-series plot to accommodate the two to three hour running time. Some scenes wear out their welcome. The wedding, for example, is a grandiose spectacle in an awesome church. But Cimino wallows in the spectacle of the wedding to excess. Indeed, the ceremony is as interesting as its setting is magnificent, but it does little to advance the plot. The entire wedding ceremony qualifies as the chick flick part of this war film.Never does Cimino foreshadow his transitions. The changes of locale from America to Vietnam and from combat to capture are distressingly abrupt. The Deer Hunter emerges as an uneven, series of loosely strung together scenes that are more powerful than their overall design. At times, too, the symbolism is so obvious as to be corny. During the wedding, John Savage and Meryl Streep drink a toast to their marriage. If they drink without spilling a drop, they will have good luck. In a close-up, we see an unnoticed fleck of wine stain her dress. Other scenes seem unconsciously funny. Michael (Robert De Niro), the hero of the movie, who is the The Deer Hunter of the title, is shown in a hunting scene stalking a deer. He edges up on one side of the slope framed by majestic mountains and raises his rifle. The camera pans to reveal a deer poised not far off as proudly as the deer in the Hartford Insurance commercial. If that isn't sufficient, the music behind the scene is a heavenly choir that celebrates the relationship of De Niro to the deer in the game of the hunt, a solemn heroic act. How pretentious!Director Michael Cimino does direct The Deer Hunter with verve. They early mill town scenes have gusto galore, and the setting of the film is solidly established by the era's popular music.

What he plays is ET, or Jeff Bridges' character from Starman....an alien who needs to be protected from the bad scientists at the CIA.

Even low budget horror films should have standards, and this film is so bad, it makes some of the worst 'Friday the 13th' movies look good. John Carpenter's original film is rightly considered a classic, and one of the most influential films in the genre. The sequels have been a very mixed bag, but I never thought it would get this bad. Other reviewers have commented on the fact that this movie is atrociously poorly made, so I won't repeat these charges, except to add that the musical score by Danny Lux is like everything else about this film way below standard. My main gripe is really this To me the 'heart' of the Halloween series was always the character of Laurie Strode, played wonderfully by Jamie Lee Curtis. The fact that they chose to dispose of her in such a casual way within the first 15 mins. of the film does simply not ring true with the continuity of the original storyline of 'Halloween', 'Halloween 2' and 'Halloween H20'. Not only is the proposed explanation of how Michael Myers survived his decapitation in H20 completely unbelievable, even for a film in this genre, but the way Laurie Strode meets her doom is utterly ridiculous and beyond 'suspension of disbelief' if you consider the way the character developed through the previous films. I can't understand why Jamie Lee Curtis would ever accept having Laurie Strode written out of the Halloween series as if she were a character in a day-time soap opera, but maybe she just finally wanted out of the franchise. In sum, any fan of the original 'Halloween' film should feel offended by the low quality offered us in 'Halloween Resurrection' The movie is so bad that I consider it an insult to the audience.

Disney's golden age has been a parade of hit-and-miss affairs. Although their classic style of animated wonders have always been classic and have lived on as superb forms of entertainment, not all eventually held up to the standards. Disney version of Lewis Carroll's ALICE IN WONDERLAND is a hit-and-miss affair. On one hand, this is one crazy story that's bound to befuddle a few youngsters just as the original 'Alice' stories have. Disney is pretty odd ground for Carroll's faerie tale, but I beg to differ. I think Disney animation would be more than adequate in bringing this strange and eccentric world, resulting into one of Disney's most bizarre and mostly under-appreciated efforts. Disney's version of Carroll's fable doesn't exactly charm as much as it is supposed to, but there's still a lot to be seen in little Alice's (voiced by Kathryn Beaumont) journey across the world of utter nonsense. Disney's term of nonsense sure is a sweet one, since this movie is filled with charming and colorful surreal visuals, lifted straight from the pages of Carroll's story. From the Cheshire cat (voiced by Sterling Halloway) to the hot-headed Queen of Hearts (voiced with malice by Verna Felton), to the Mad Tea Party featuring Ed Wynn's wild antics as the voice of the Mad Hatter.The clever nonsense stated in Carroll's stories don't always fit screen standards and a little dumbing-down is bound to occur, but Disney's ALICE IN WONDERLAND doesn't strip the story down completely as a bare bones kiddie flick. There's enough sophistication here to do justice to its source and the eye-candy animation is very eager to please the youngsters. It's far from perfect, but this is such a trippy film that it's hard not to get lost in it. Rating **** out of 5.
