Nothing is more important to me than films, and no film is more important to me than back to the future. So you could easily say its one of the most important things in my life. Its that awesome. I plan to make a video review of it sometime, but I am new at that and don't want to make it any less than perfect.I will never forget the first time I saw BTTF. It all started when my parents had their fancy dinner parties with their friends. As a kid those things a freaking torturous, so I usually spun out of there unless I was forced to stay. However I always enjoyed hearing about the movies that they remembered from the good old days. One film they often talked about is Back to the Future and how much they thought I would enjoy it. So that intrigued me a lot. One day my mom bought the complete trilogy on DVD. I couldn't believe it, my mother had never boughten a film because she thinks its a waste of space. So I was in awe and I couldn't wait to watch it that night.I don't remember all of the details of me watching it, I do remember looking at the clock 15 minutes later and saying  what the heck, its been 2 hours! For me it totally surpassed the hype and gave me the most entertaining experience of my life. I have a vivid memory of my mom telling me to calm down because I was quoting the movie up the butt. So now that I've built it up so much, why exactly do I like this film so damn much?Im a junior filmmaker and often hear people say that the story is the most important thing in a film. There is no need to describe this story because if you don't know it, your probably living under rock. Suffice to say this film has such a great idea that is so easy to work with the lines practically write themselves. The whole idea of seeing your parents at your age is so universally funny that everybody can get the jokes. I seriously think this is one of the tightest screenplays ever. Everything is so tightly connected that I notice something new every time.The character world is full of clichés. However this whole cast brings something amazing to each of their performances. However I always have to go back to Doc and Marty as 2 of the best characters ever. Marty has like the perfect wisecracking attitude and an all around lovable personality, and the Doc just spits out comedy gold throughout the entire film. Also nobody could ever forget Biff Tannen. You just love to hate him, you also love to love him. I mean, my god, they made some of best characters is history.I usually don't get in to comedy movies because I often don't get in the movie, which makes it not funny. This movie had me laughing my butt(head) off. ITs just plain and simply and awesome and funny as heck script. Also who could forget all the classic lines in here. I honestly could quote lines from this for hours. It just plain old cracks me up.I need to wrap this up because there is nothing I can say that will show the greatness of this film. I can say with pride that its my all-time favorite film. It may be cheesy, but I will cherish it forever. This a comedy, a romance, an action movie, and a high school movie all in one, whats not to love. So how bought you make like a tree and get out of here, and check out Back to the Future!

I have watched this many, many times since that first date - I wouldn't say every Christmas season, but probably most - and it never, ever gets stale. Even though there are parts of the dialogue I now know off by heart it still makes me laugh. Chevy Chase was born to play Clark Griswold. He's had the character nailed perfectly since his first appearance, and this is no exception. Clark is such a lovable guy. He's kind of irritating, he's a bit clumsy, he overdoes everything and he grumbles (and sometimes worse) a lot of the time, but he's a good guy. That side of him really comes out in this movie. Clark might grumble, but he loves having the family around him - even cousin Eddie (who thankfully returns after being absent from European Vacation) although he likely wouldn't admit it. He not only loves having his family around him, he loves his family - all of them. It's a simple scene, like the one in which he has his heart to heart chat with Eddie's little girl Ruby Sue about Santa Claus, that shows that off. He might look put off when Eddie goes overboard with his requests for Christmas presents after Clark tells him he'll buy them for him since Eddie has no money, but you know he doesn't really mind doing it. I like Clark. I'd be buddies with Clark.There's so much going on in this movie that works so well. The chaotic family gathering is really nothing more than a deliberate exaggeration of the experience so many people have in getting their families (in all their diversity) together for the holidays - which means that in a bizarre sort of way it's pretty easy to relate to. Then there's Clark's struggles with getting the 25,000 lights he's decorated his house with to turn on; the understandable frustrations of the neighbours in having to deal with this insane family living next door; the wild sled ride. And there's the cat. Oh the cat. The poor, poor cat! It's funny.Strangely, the weakest parts to this for me at least were the beginning and the end. Both seemed to go a little overboard.

Hoffman is a survivor from Little Big Horn (Custer's Last Stand) and this is an invented life up to that point, told from memory to man with a tape recorder at the age of 123.And the old (old!) Hoffman is pretty terrific, mostly in the narration, but including some pretty caked on make-up, too. Most of the movie is a young Hoffman as both Indian and White Man (alternating, depending on how he gets miraculously saved from one disaster after another). It's a farce, yes, but there are overtones of tragedy throughout (the annihilation of a race can only be so funny for so long) and there are some truly violent scenes, mostly of Indians being slaughtered by the Army.It might help to know this is a metaphor of sorts about the brutality of the Army in Vietnam, which was raging at the time.

","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Western"},{"date":"1 December 2011","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" First off, this motion picture is no entertainment. It has more to do with art. The German title Der Himmel über Berlin (The Sky above Berlin) is a better fit than Wings of Desire. Unfortunately some translations convey some different ideas than the original authors first intended.It's a movie about angels flying over divided Berlin (1987), almost totally shot in Black&White. As the Angels in the movie can't have a feeling of life, only an abstract perception of it, the directors have wisely taken away ours colors, so in a sense our experience is closer to theirs than otherwise it would be. There are some moments in full colors, but they don't add much to the watching of it.It all it starts out with our angels listening to people's thoughts, which can range from the most trivial -if I buy 10 tickets I can save 1 mark &#x96; to some very existential and persisting question as the who was I before I was me, or why am I me and not him ?.From all the angels shown, all in long coats and ponytails &#x96; men and women alike &#x96; the focus lye on two. Domiel (Bruno Ganz &#x96; Der Untergang) and Cassiel (Otto Sander). They walk, listen and observe, and it's learned they have been so doing since the earth has been earth, from the very beginning.Once they meet up inside a car in a car dealer for a rendezvous. Marion is first in sharing his experiences. Here he doesn't mention Government decisions, political affairs, his concern is regular people and what they do that somewhat break expectations. One example is, IIRC, is a woman who folds an umbrella in a storm. And so their chat go on and so it is first revealed Domiel's desire to become to feel&#x85; simple stuff in life, like newspaper ink in the tip of the fingers. He wants to feel. Feel the good and the bad in life, all of it ! This will grows the more he observes. It is a movie about observing. Don't wait for a big plot. It all goes slowly for us, but lighting fast considering what the main characters are.Domiel wants to make the plunge. And a person falling has some special signification in this movie; A man falls to death. Marion copycats this suicide, though he feels nothing. Marion (Solveig Dommartin) is a trapeze artist whose charm and thoughts eventually led Domiel's to coming to life. She is flirting with falling, and if in her last circus appearance she fell ? she thinks. There is a stunt falling in the settings of movie Peter Falk, as himself in a solid display, is an observing actor at.Falk an angel himself 30 years prior is also observing. His acting only appears on a TV screen. He is an observer in life. Even though his appearance in this world is still much angel-like, he invites angels to life.It feels like a very, very pessimistic movie. The history is the history of the losses, physical and spiritual ones. An old writer desperately looks for the Potsdamer Platz, for the lost experiences. People are, more than ever, isles of isolation or states as the many states there are in Germany. The many lives Domiel and Cassiel observe seem pointless, hopeless or helpless. People feel the vacuity of life and its desperation, and it shows through their thinking. Cassiel remains aloof. Domiel doesn't.Domiel, after observing all this, decides to live. And that is where it gives us hope. The two ways to redeem this miserable a existence have been long been paved in the history of thought, however. The first is the idealization of childhood and animal life. Both are pure, and refer not only to an earlier and purer stage of existence in one's life, but also in human history. It somewhat follow the steps of some old schools in philosophy blaming development for the corruption of the being. Rousseau had already written about that as early as 1750 at least, in his then infamous turned classic Discourse on the Arts and Sciences. Their talking over a bridge about some happening involving animals, and the circus sequence, the presentation for kids are symbolic of these two. One can live without that.The second is love.

Ethan and family friend Martin Pawley set off in pursuit, resolved to find those responsible and exact vengeance.The Searchers is one of the greatest westerns ever made, and certainly one of the most thought-provoking. It's a film filled with extraordinarily beautiful images - the exquisite opening, the snow scenes, the iconographic buttes of Ford's beloved Monument Valley, the unforgettable final image of the door closing on Wayne, many others. It's also a film full of subtle allusions. Where has Ethan been since the war ended, and where did his money come from ? Were he and his brother's wife past lovers ? There are so many intriguing scenes and nuances (the older daughter's moment of realisation when the lamp is blown out, the big closeup of Ethan as the mad woman sits playing with the doll, the unseen horrors of the murdered victims, Laurie's face as the young men fight over her) that it asks many more questions than it answers, demanding multiple viewings. The biggest question of all for me is who is Ethan ? Is he the hero ? If so, at best he's a bigot and at worst a killer and thief. Here's a man who hates Indians (though he conspicuously knows their habits, customs and language and takes great delight in scalping a Chief), who refuses to accept that the Confederates lost the war, who kills both Indians and whites (he shoots Futterman in the back) and seems prepared to murder his own niece just because he thinks it's for the best. He's also bad-tempered, judgemental, egotistical and selfish, just for added value. I'm fascinated by the idea of the flawed hero, and by to what extent in this film Ford and Wayne deliberately intended Ethan to be perceived this way. I mean, he was the Duke after all. He's supposed to be the good guy. In the end though, I can't understand Ethan and I especially can't understand the ending; it's clear throughout the whole odyssey that he intends to kill Debbie, yet when it comes down to it he doesn't. I just don't get this. I appreciate that stories can end with a character having a life-changing epiphany (Nicholson in The Bridge On The River Kwai, Roy Batty in Blade Runner), but it makes no sense here. Ethan is too macho to ever vocalise his feelings, but his final protective heroism towards Debbie contradicts all his previous actions. My wife thinks that's it's the physical act of touching her (his own flesh and blood, and arguably perhaps his own daughter) which makes him realise what he's become, but I just don't buy that. It remains an enigma for me. It's not the only thing that grates in the movie - some of the acting is far too broad (the whole Hunter-Miles-Curtis love triangle subplot could be dumped) with too much shouting and rubbernecking, but Worden is great fun as the loopy half-breed Mose Harper and Wayne's son Patrick is a good sport as the nervous Yankee soldier. Trivia - Natalie Wood's younger sister Lana plays her as a child in the early scenes, and Buddy Holly got the title of his hit song That'll Be The Day from this movie. Scripted by Frank S. Nugent, based on a novel by Alan LeMay, this is a moving, evocative, brilliant, frustrating, exceptional American classic.

","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Western"},{"date":"1 December 2011","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" In 1880's Texas, Ethan Edwards returns from the Civil War to his brother's ranch just as Comanches abduct Ethan's nieces and kill the rest of the family. Ethan and family friend Martin Pawley set off in pursuit, resolved to find those responsible and exact vengeance.The Searchers is one of the greatest westerns ever made, and certainly one of the most thought-provoking. It's a film filled with extraordinarily beautiful images - the exquisite opening, the snow scenes, the iconographic buttes of Ford's beloved Monument Valley, the unforgettable final image of the door closing on Wayne, many others. It's also a film full of subtle allusions. Where has Ethan been since the war ended, and where did his money come from ? Were he and his brother's wife past lovers ? There are so many intriguing scenes and nuances (the older daughter's moment of realisation when the lamp is blown out, the big closeup of Ethan as the mad woman sits playing with the doll, the unseen horrors of the murdered victims, Laurie's face as the young men fight over her) that it asks many more questions than it answers, demanding multiple viewings. The biggest question of all for me is who is Ethan ? Is he the hero ? If so, at best he's a bigot and at worst a killer and thief. Here's a man who hates Indians (though he conspicuously knows their habits, customs and language and takes great delight in scalping a Chief), who refuses to accept that the Confederates lost the war, who kills both Indians and whites (he shoots Futterman in the back) and seems prepared to murder his own niece just because he thinks it's for the best. He's also bad-tempered, judgemental, egotistical and selfish, just for added value. I'm fascinated by the idea of the flawed hero, and by to what extent in this film Ford and Wayne deliberately intended Ethan to be perceived this way. I mean, he was the Duke after all. He's supposed to be the good guy. In the end though, I can't understand Ethan and I especially can't understand the ending; it's clear throughout the whole odyssey that he intends to kill Debbie, yet when it comes down to it he doesn't. I just don't get this. I appreciate that stories can end with a character having a life-changing epiphany (Nicholson in The Bridge On The River Kwai, Roy Batty in Blade Runner), but it makes no sense here. Ethan is too macho to ever vocalise his feelings, but his final protective heroism towards Debbie contradicts all his previous actions. My wife thinks that's it's the physical act of touching her (his own flesh and blood, and arguably perhaps his own daughter) which makes him realise what he's become, but I just don't buy that. It remains an enigma for me. It's not the only thing that grates in the movie - some of the acting is far too broad (the whole Hunter-Miles-Curtis love triangle subplot could be dumped) with too much shouting and rubbernecking, but Worden is great fun as the loopy half-breed Mose Harper and Wayne's son Patrick is a good sport as the nervous Yankee soldier.

(There is some mild language in it though, so I wouldn't let the VERY young kids see it.) The plot is sort of Network meets A Christmas Carol. Bill Murry, TV producer is a selfish workaholic who will do anything to up the ratings for his station, including incorporating sexy dance numbers and violent explosions in their production of A Christmas Carol. He makes everyone work producing a live Christmas Carol on Christmas Eve, so no one gets to spend Christmas Eve with their families.Bill Murry must be a really nice guy, because I did not think he was a convincing meany at all. But it's a kids movie, so that's okay. Bill's character's name is Frank Xavior Cross. At one time, there is a definition of Cross posted in the background as Something you nail people to. Xavior is Latin for Savior, and Frank means honest, so I liked this subtle reference to Christ in the movie.There are references to things in the '80's. Bill Murry has a mullet haircut at one point. He drinks Bacardi with Tab. He has a vision of a man on fire and he mentions Richard Pryor. They show a film clip that has a drive-by shooting. The thrill of Ginsu knives. Reference to Chernobyl. Mary Lou Rhetton is also in the movie.One of the best parts is the Ghost of Christmas Present. Carol Kane is dressed like a frothy pink fairy princess, and she imitates the sweet, trilling voice of Glenda the Good Witch of the North, but she constantly bops, pokes and tweaks Bill Murry every chance she gets, like Moe of the Three Stooges.The ending was my favorite part super feel-good ending. Bill talks to everyone, including the viewing audience about being nice, kind and wonderful; about being the kind of person that you know you should be. Everyone bursts into song and Bill looks right at the camera and encourages us to sing along! Wonderful! ","genre":null},{"date":"1 December 2011","score":"","review":" I saw this on TV one night.

Joe has one night stand with the easy Carmen and she escapes from him. The infatuated Joe is arrested and can not forget Carmen. When he is released, his commander sends him to the pilot school; however, he meets Carmen and he hits a sergeant that is flirting with her. Joe flees from the Military Police with Carmen and they head to Chicago. But sooner Carmen finds a new lover, the box fighter Husky Miller (Joe Adams) and leaves Joe that is chased by the MP. Carmen Jones is a boring and overrated film by Otto Preminger that uses the music of Bizet's opera. The whole cast is Afro-American and I did not like this movie. My vote is four.Title (Brazil) Carmen Jones ","genre":"Drama, Musical, Romance"}]
