In the art of film, director John Carpenter defined the slasher horror sub-genre of horror films in 1978's Halloween. In that film, his use of the first-person camera views, establishing the final girl trend, showing that people who are promiscuous or drug users get killed and other elements went on to become imitated by other filmmakers on the many slasher horror films that followed. It also established Michael Myers (called The Shape) as the stealthy, almost invincible killer that later became an American pop culture icon.Of course, the $325,000 movie went on to make tons of money and Halloween II followed a few years later and made nice profit even though it never matched its predecessor's success.Then in 1982, Halloween III Season of the Witch came out. Originally, the Halloween film franchise was geared towards making distinct, independent stories with completely new characters dealing with the Halloween season in general. Halloween III proved to be profitable but got slammed by critics and several viewers hated it simply because it was too different and had no Michael Myers (who was shown destroyed in Halloween II).If you ask me, Halloween III Season of the Witch is actually an under- rated and misunderstood horror film. It is no slasher. It has no Michael Myers. It has no zombie or vampire elements of horror. But those differences don't make it a bad movie at all.In fact, Halloween III was more about the witchcraft aspect of Halloween's origins outside of America as well as social commentary about capitalism and consumerism. These three primary elements are, least to say, very challenging to build a foundation of horror with. Still, the filmmakers pulled off nicely with that challenge and what turned was that Halloween III has a more original concept of horror than most other horror films made ever since. It never feels generic and continues to be creepy.Without spoiling too much of the plot, Halloween III begins with a desperate man running away from mysterious men in suits and ties. He eventually gets killed at night at a hospital and his killer weirdly left the place, entered a parked car, poured gasoline around, lit the gasoline and blew the car up.Of course, the person who witnesses the explosion and events at the hospital is Dr. Challis (Tom Atkins) who is not only the protagonist but also a challenging one for viewers to follow. Why is that? Because Dr. Challis is an undesirable man for a horror film protagonist &#x96; when he is not working, he drinks a lot of liquor, spends time at bars, does not care much about his family and is a womanizer. Ironically, this aspect of the film makes Halloween III even more unique from other horror films.So Dr. Challis meets Ellie (Stacey Nelkin), the daughter of the murder victim. She strongly believes something is very wrong and something big was behind the murder of her father. Together they travel to a far away town where a big company making Halloween masks is being led by an Irish businessman named Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy).Enough of the story. You will just have to watch the film on DVD or Blu- ray for the Halloween season or whenever you feel like watching a horror movie different from the rest. Even during its time, Halloween III had a low budget although the production value on screen don't necessarily reflect that. Considering the challenges the filmmakers had to endure, Halloween III works as a horror flick as it provides scary and creepy moments nicely and also expresses the message that there is something behind all the commercialism of Halloween. In any business dealing with seasonal trends, there is always something that keeps people spending their money on products they don't really need and there is always a company that tends to profit from it.Is Halloween III an anti-business movie? In some ways, yes. Just look at the isolated town where the business and its factory are located. If you listen to the dialog closely, you will realize that locals of the town are being put down by the company (Silver Shamrock) which employs people coming from elsewhere. Also there is that reflection of corporate-led control on the town with those many surveillance cameras and an imposed curfew (who would want to live in a community so restrictive and without public officials to stand up for the people?) and more. Naturally, Conal Cochran is the main villain radically different from not only Michael Myers but all other horror film villains. Dan O'Herlihy's performance is undeniably solid.Another notable aspect of Halloween III that deserves attention was its defiance of the unwritten rule of movies and television that prohibit the showing of children getting killed on-screen. The filmmakers really had the courage and insight to break that rule to show what kind of evil would happen when kids wear Cochran's masks (each equipped with material from a stolen Stonehenge) and watch the Silver Shamrock commercial (with that very repetitive, mind-numbing song). The bad things that turnout are enough to shock viewers and even send chills up the spines of parents who are afraid of their children engaging in Halloween. Overall, Halloween III Season of the Witch is one of the most under- rated and most misunderstood horror films that truly deserves your attention in this day and age. It defied many of the clichés or traditions of most horror films and yet succeeded in delivering spooky moments in unpredictable fashion. It is also challenging to watch given its undesirable protagonist and having no final girl to outlast the evil. To call the film a failure because it did not have Michael Myers is a big mistake. Be sure to watch this film every Halloween.

All of those elements make The Toxic Avenger not only one of my favorite movies but also one of the all time great Cult Classics and Troma Entertainment at their best.Set in the fictional town of Tromaville,New Jersey,The Toxic Avenger tells the story Melvin Junko(Mark Torgi),a 90-pound weakling that works as a Janitor at the Tromaville Gym and is always getting pushed around. When Melvin becomes the victim of a terrible prank,Melvin jumps out of a window into a barrel of Toxic waste turning Melvin into the most hideously deformed creature of Superhuman size and strength that protects the people becoming...The Toxic Avenger(Mitchell Cohen).Before The Toxic Avenger,Troma Studios was(and still is)an independent studio company that produced low budget Sex Comedies such as Squeeze Play(1979),Waitress(1981),Stuck On You(1982)and The First Turn On!(1983)to little success. Then along came The Toxic Avenger,an amazing and over the top Horror Comedy Action Superhero film that became a Cult Classic that put Troma entertainment on the map and also spawning three sequels,a children's Cartoon series,a stage musical and gave movie audiences one of the most beloved Superheros of all time in The Toxic Avenger. In other words,Troma was the studio The Toxic Avenger built. The Toxic Avenger is a classic Horror Comedy,a great film and one of the goriest,bloodiest and most politically incorrect films of all time and is so depraved and twisted that I don't a major studio then and now would have made The Toxic Avenger the way it is. Only s company like Troma entertainment would have the guts to make film this way. The Comedy in The Toxic Avenger is hilarious,wild and over the top thanks to the characters and situations that happen in the movie and you as a viewer will be in tears laughing while at the same time being disgusted at some of the things you see which I think adds to the appeal and so bad it's good style of The Toxic Avenger. What also makes TTA so funny and over the top is the way the film tackles subjects in a offbeat style such as violence,sex,corrupt politicians,Gym Clubs,toxic waste dumping,criminals,drug use and more. No subject in this film is left untouched. While TTA is a Horror film the Horror doesn't come from the movie being scary because it's not,the Horror comes from the amounts of violence and gore that happens in the film. The blood and gore while not very serious and at times funny the gore is not for the weak at heart because the blood and gore comes fast and quick. For a movie that was made on a small budget,TTA has some really great and exciting Action and fight scenes that are thrilling and well executed while being played for laughs. There is also a terrific car chase scene that will remind viewers viewers of The French Connection,Mad Max Films and car chase movies of the 1970s. It's a car chase that is funny and unforgettable. The Toxic Avenger(or Toxie as he was later called in the sequels)is one of the all time great Superhero characters in films and beyond because he is a mixture and combination of other great Superheros such as Batman,Superman,Spider-Man and The Incredible Hulk and like those four Superhero icons The Toxic Avenger is a crime fighter and wants to protect people from criminals and other bad things using his power and strength to get the bad guys. Also,like any other Superheros The Toxic Avenger is very complex having to deal with going from a 90 pound weakling to a Monster Hero of Superhuman size and strength,finding love with a blind girlfriend and trying to figure out what he's doing is right or wrong. The Toxic Avenger is a classic character you will never forget. The ending is amazing and memorable and adds to the legend of The Toxic Avenger and will have you smiling and cheering at the screen. A great conclusion.The whole cast is wonderful(in a so bad it's good way). Mitchell Cohen is excellent as The Toxic Avenger,with Cohen bringing depth and great body language to the performance. Andree Maranda is wonderful as Sexy as Sara,The Toxic Avenger's blind girlfriend. Mark Torgl is funny and over the top as Melvin,The Toxic Avenger's alter ego. Jennifer Prichard and Cindy Manion are terrific and sexy as Wanda and Julie Slug and Bozo's girlfriends. Robert Prichard and Gary Schneider are funny and memorable as Slug and Bozo,Gym bullies. Pat Ryan Jr. is great Mayor Peter Goody,a corrupt politician. Dick Martinsen(Officer O'Clancy),Dan Snow,(Cigar Face),David N. Weiss(Chief Of Police),Sarabel Levinson(Melvin's Mom),Pat Klipatrick(Leroy),Larry Sulton(Frank)and Mike Russo(Rico)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for an early appearance by from Marisa Tomei(Heath Club Girl).The direction by Lloyd Kaufman(as Samuel Weil)and Michael Herz is fantastic and memorable,with Kaufman and Herz bringing energy,style and keeping the film moving at a great pace. Fine direction by Kaufman and Hertz.The soundtrack has great songs such as Body Talk(Sandra Farina),Is This Love and Nothing At All(Mark Hoffman And Race).

Wonderful make-up effects,Aspinall.In final word,if you love Troma films,Horror films,Action movies,Cult Films,B-Movies,Superhero films,Comedies or genre films in general,I highly suggest you see The Toxic Avenger,an excellent,hilarious and over the top Cult Classic that is Troma entertainment at it's very best.

Jennifer Prichard and Cindy Manion are terrific and sexy as Wanda and Julie Slug and Bozo's girlfriends. Robert Prichard and Gary Schneider are funny and memorable as Slug and Bozo,Gym bullies. Pat Ryan Jr. is great Mayor Peter Goody,a corrupt politician. Dick Martinsen(Officer O'Clancy),Dan Snow,(Cigar Face),David N. Weiss(Chief Of Police),Sarabel Levinson(Melvin's Mom),Pat Klipatrick(Leroy),Larry Sulton(Frank)and Mike Russo(Rico)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for an early appearance by from Marisa Tomei(Heath Club Girl).The direction by Lloyd Kaufman(as Samuel Weil)and Michael Herz is fantastic and memorable,with Kaufman and Herz bringing energy,style and keeping the film moving at a great pace. Fine direction by Kaufman and Hertz.The soundtrack has great songs such as Body Talk(Sandra Farina),Is This Love and Nothing At All(Mark Hoffman And Race). Good soundtrack.The special make-up effects by Jennifer Aspinall are fantastic,gory and realistic and truly add to the film. Wonderful make-up effects,Aspinall.In final word,if you love Troma films,Horror films,Action movies,Cult Films,B-Movies,Superhero films,Comedies or genre films in general,I highly suggest you see The Toxic Avenger,an excellent,hilarious and over the top Cult Classic that is Troma entertainment at it's very best. Highly Recommended. 10\/10. ","genre":"Action, Comedy, Horror"},{"date":"16 October 2013","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Make a full-length feature cartoon? It couldn't be done. And why should it be anyway, nobody is going to want to watch a 90-minute cartoon. After proving those commonly held thoughts to be oh so wrong with the triumph of Snow White what would Walt Disney do for an encore? Pinocchio came next and showed Disney was not going to rest on his laurels. For as magnificent an achievement as Snow White was the animation on display in that film could be said to be a little crude compared to what was to come. Pinocchio advanced the art form. Visually there is nothing to quibble with here, everything looks fantastic. And what great action too, imagination is not limited to what the animators might be able to achieve. It seems they could achieve whatever they wanted. There are some big, bold sequences in this film that show the great jump the Disney team had made in just three years since Snow White. Disney had succeeded in making the impossible possible.Everyone is familiar by now with the famous story of Pinocchio, that of the wooden puppet magically brought to life. But while he can walk and talk and sing and dance he is still made of wood and wishes to be a real boy. His quest to become real will take him to some very interesting places. Some very bizarre places too. If you're going to accept the basic premise of a wooden puppet brought to life I guess you can accept pretty much anything. But there is the sense that maybe the story ultimately gets a little too weird for the film's good. The second half of the film is not as much fun as the first. It even gets a little scary, poor Pinocchio in almost constant peril. Luckily our puppet hero has some helpers. There's Jiminy Cricket who serves as his conscience, trying to help the incredibly naive Pinocchio know right from wrong. Whenever Pinocchio's really stuck you can count on the Blue Fairy to show up and help out. And of course there is kindly, old Geppetto, Pinocchio's maker, his father so to speak who has his own strange misadventure.The story lags somewhat in the middle and does take those truly bizarre turns toward the end. But as a whole the story is satisfying, sure to leave a smile on your face. It's so easy to love Pinocchio, the character, that you are willing to overlook any minor quibbles with Pinocchio, the film. And the main character is not the only thing to love. Jiminy is a lot of fun, Geppetto is one of the most kindhearted characters you'll see in any film. And as much as you like the good guys the film gives you some stellar bad guys to hiss at too. The score is terrific. There is the iconic When You Wish upon a Star to open the film and some other good songs sprinkled in along the way. The film provides laughs, charm, suspense, drama, pretty much everything you could ask for. And it looks absolutely magnificent, taking animation to new heights. Pinocchio is one of those films which is not just appreciated but beloved. One of Disney's crown jewels, a film which will live forever.

How it would start and what would be the consequences? Many theories and ideas have been raised over the years, all almost similar always pointing to a possible nuclear apocalypse. Then the director Stanley Kubrick decided to take these theories and joined them with his own ideas and made the masterpiece Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is a satire that tells the consequences (in Kubrick's mind) of the nuclear war between the USA and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It all starts when the ultra-patriotic and ultra-paranoid General Jack Ripper (Sterling Hayden) seems to have a crazy and patriotic attack, and gives the order to all B-52 bombers that surround Russia initiate the nuclear attack. Such an order reaches the ears of the also very patriotic General 'Buck' Turgidson (George C. Scott) to rapidly informs the President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers). Now the general, the president and his aides, the Russian Ambassador Alexi of Sadesky and the former Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove (also Peter Sellers) have to find a plan to prevent the attack from the bombers starting the nuclear war.Can you imagine the controversy that this film caused at the time it came out? The world after the Vietnam War and America still redeeming itself. But not only the subject, but the way that Kubrick presents it. What could be a political drama with the theories and ideas of the consequences of war can be presented with great dialogs (which are actually 80% of the film), Kubrick made it a comedy. From start to finish Kubrick delivers a intelligent humor and silly at times without losing the mood, always presenting the possible consequences in a hilarious and satirical way, thanks to yet another flawless Kubrick script.The use of the ultra-patriotism from the General Jack Ripper (if you pay attention his name is a tribute to Jack the Ripper) and the General 'Buck' Turgidson is exactly the statement of the ultra - desperation that the Americans had during the war. General Ripper has a huge patriotism and love for his country that led him to give the order to the nuclear attack, only for precaution. And General Buck is a clear representation of the lazy and ignorant patriotic American people.And where Dr. Strangelove gets into all that? Not only as comic relief (in all his scenes), but also explain the title How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. In all his scenes, the former Nazi with one hand with own will, tends to try to convince everyone in the war room to accept the situation that they are, accept the nuclear apocalypse. It all comes in all its hilarious scenes where he presents arguments behind arguments silly and clever at the same time, showing the benefits of the nuclear war, all to do with a new era for human kind.Not only the humor and genius of Kubrick that are superbly presented that give strength to the film, but also the fantastic performances of the cast. Both Sterling Hayden and George C. Scott shine with their ultra-patriotism; also Peter Bull as the weird Russian ambassador and Slim Pickens as Major King Kong (pilot from one of the B52s that will launch the bombs). But who steals the show with AMAZING performances is Peter Sellers in all his three roles. As much as the president of the united states, or the crazy and smart ex-Nazi and the friendly gentleman Captain Lionel Mandrake (that tries to convince the general Ripper to stop the attack), Sellers shines (I think he was the only actor who gave ideas and improvisations in the film and Kubrick liked them and changed things on the script because of it).Many critics consider this the best film of Stanley Kubrick, and not for anything. Kubrick joined with his genius, years of ideas and theories of war in a hilarious and intelligent comedy, making not only a governmental critic but also entertains us from start to finish.
