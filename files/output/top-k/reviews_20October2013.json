The contrast between the talismanic, inspirational, irrepressible Ali who most Zaireans backed, and on the other hand, the quieter, almost mythic Foreman also makes a fascinating aspect of this movie. Foreman was heavily favored against Ali after he had destroyed Frazier and Norton and knowledgeable boxing observers expected the worst for Ali. Ali's bluster, perhaps to entertain, perhaps to provoke Foreman, perhaps to make things interesting, also made the film amazing. Ali's ease with the media made him the more sympathetic boxer to Zaireans, but so too did his humor and commitment to justice. Another fascinating feature of the film was the role of Don King in promoting the fight. While King was a great promoter, commentators like Norman Mailer and George Plimpton rightly look askance at King's jarring amorality. It's probably not surprising that King was able to come to terms with Mobutu on the hosting of the fight. For all his well-known negatives though, King put on a landmark event by also booking some of the biggest musical acts of the day, from The Spinners, James Brown, from B.B. King to Miriam Makeda. We are the beneficiaries as we get to hear some fantastic live performances.The direction and editing are great too. Commentary from Norman Mailer and George Plimpton give us context to understand the events better and the use of lots of archival footage make it that much better. The way it is framed are credits to the editor and director.All that said though, Ali is the star of this film for his boxing but also for his heart.

It's an incredibly realistic story and beautifully shot film with excellent acting from George C Scott.It tells the story of a composer who purchases a historic old house, after losing his family in a freak accident. Being a rationally minded academic, he starts to investigate when a number of unexplained occurrences take place. His curiosity leads him to uncover an old room, which had been padlocked, boarded up, and hidden away. In it, he finds a music box that plays the exact piece of music that he had seemingly just composed. This confounds him.Under the impression he is being subject to a haunting, he gets in contact with a medium, who uses the automatic writing technique to connect with the spirit which has been trying to get his attention. She discovers that a boy named Joseph Carmichael occupies his house- particularly the room in the attic, where he was killed. The man corroborates this with his own audio recording of the séance- which actually provides him with more information that he can use to further his investigation.By researching both the history of the house and the Carmichaels- a now Senatorial family with their own empire- he is lead to an old parcel of land that used to be the site of the ranch owned by the Carmichael family. He is particularly interested in finding an old well, over which a house has since been built.He manages to convince the homeowner to let him dig up the well. Within it, he finds the frail bones of a long dead young boy. Further investigation leads him to uncover an old medallion that had belonged to the boy.Through these actions, he has gone beyond just helping the spirit with his unfinished business...he is also revealing a deadly conspiracy that will out the skeletons hidden in the Carmichael family's closet.It turns out that the father of the current Senator (the heir of the Carmichael fortune and legacy) had secretly murdered his frail, arthritic son, by drowning him in a tub in the room in the attic; before burying him in the well on their ranch; and replacing the boy with a Swiss orphan, whom they claimed was the miraculously healed Joseph. Though really being his changeling; having replaced the boy and gone on to become heir of the Carmichael empire, himself.But it's clear Joseph's spirit will not rest until the truth is revealed, and vengeance has been reaped. Ultimately leading the film's fiery conclusion.This is an incredibly realistic tale of haunting that focuses on the experience of helping a traumatized spirit with it's unfinished business- one of the numerous types of very real, well documented, ghost-related phenomenon. This discerns it from something like The Entity, which covers a different aspect of the phenomenon- and type of spirit- altogether. The incorporation of a political conspiracy into the story only acts to make it more compelling. The acting in the film is quite solid, the cinematography is beautiful- especially those tracking shots through the house- and the special effects are simple, but effective.

Basically it starts like any regular day in Los Angeles, California, construction engineer Stuart Graff (Charlton Heston) does not have the best relationship currently with his wife Remy (Ava Gardner), as she is easily made jealous and is possessive, so he has been having an affair with actress Denise Marshall (Geneviève Bujold), the widow of a co-worker. Remy tries to convince her father and Stuart's employer Sam Royce (Lorne Greene) to influence husband to stop seeing the other woman, and meanwhile rogue L.A.P.D. policeman Lew Slade (Cool Hand Luke's George Kennedy) is suspended and considers quitting the force after punching another police officer, and perverted grocery store manager Jody Joad (Marjoe Gortner) is lusting after the sister of Rosa Amici (Victoria Principal), the sister of Sal (Gabriel Dell) who works with daredevil motorcyclist Miles Quade (Shaft's Richard Roundtree). All of these characters' lives are threatened when all of the sudden the ground starts to shake, to the point that it becomes a powerful earthquake, buildings fall apart and are destroyed, hundreds of people are injured or killed in the falling debris, and this lasts for six to nine minutes, until nothing but devastation is left. The surviving characters all try to help themselves and each other out of the city ruins, whether it be caught in collapsed buildings, in lower levels or underground locations, and of course trapped under the concrete and other fallen construction materials, and the final blow comes when the city dam comes apart and sends a rush of water and sweeps people away, but it is all over eventually. Also starring Barry Sullivan as Dr. Stockle, Lloyd Nolan as Dr. Vance, Walter Matthau as Drunk, Monica Lewis as Royce's secretary Barbara, Lloyd Gough as Cameron, Licence to Kill's Pedro Armendáriz Jr. as Chavez and John Randolph as Mayor. The 1970's was the golden age for the disaster movies, with The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno among the most successful, but this one offered something that the others did not, cinema goers could experience the impact of the destructive earthquake forces in their seats, as many cinemas were equipped with chairs that vibrated so it felt like you were in the film. It admittedly takes a while to get to the actual earthquake of the title, but once it does you will not be disappointed to see many large buildings and bridges come apart in the destruction, it lasts a good amount of time, and some of the moments as characters try to save themselves is alright as well, a watchable and standard disaster movie. It won the Oscars for Best Sound and a Special Achievement Award for visual effects, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Film Editing, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Sound Track, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score for John Williams.

Harrison scrambles jet fighters (apparently he has his own private air force) to fire missiles to shoot down the Concorde without success. Then, Harrison's henchmen rig the cargo door to open in flight, which will surely rip the plane apart and kill everyone. Metrand and Patroni manage to belly land the crippled airliner at a French ski resort in the Alps (wow!) and evacuate the passengers before the plane explodes. Harrison is so distraught that he commits suicide at the end of the film.

Jay and Bob are fantastic with their little stoner quips.The plot is fairly weak, but it's not supposed to be brilliant. It's easy to tell that Kevin Smith just enjoys playing around with Catholicism by poking and prodding at it.Also, George Carlin is what was his usual comedic self in his cameo.
