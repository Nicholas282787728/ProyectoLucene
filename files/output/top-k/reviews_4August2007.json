For better or worse, I had seen and hated The Terminator and T2 so already I didn't think much of Cameron. His plots are riddled with holes and he populates his films with irritating characters. About forty five minutes into Aliens I was rooting for the aliens. Here are my specific problems with the film1. Newt She serves absolutely no purpose in the movie except as a half-a**ed attempt by Cameron to get us to sympathize with Ripley since she's missed her daughter's life. Now there was definitely potential here except that Newt uttered one of two lines the whole movie Ripley!!!!! and a scream that sounded like a high pitched test pattern.2. Bill Paxton I like the guy as an actor in other movies. However, it was almost like Cameron's direction to him went as follows Be as annoying as possible and make sure to say 'man' to let everyone know you just finished a sentence. When his character died (far too late into the movie), it was akin to the joy I felt when I got over pneumonia.3. The plot I remember asking myself what the hell is this? Isn't this just the same plot as the first one with worse acting? Sure enough, it was. Let's compare (SPOILER FOR ALIEN AND ALIENS) Alien people in space have to go to a planet to check out a problem. Things are not as they appear and the alien hitches a ride aboard the spaceship after a face hugger clamps on to a crew member. It kills the crew members one by one as they try in vain to kill it. Then it's discovered that the company just wants the alien as a biological weapon. One of the crew members is in on the whole thing and tries to stop everyone from killing it. Doesn't work out though. Ripley, the only one left except for the cat, thinks she's killed the alien and flies away in the escape craft. Turns out the alien followed her onto the escape ship. Ripley ends up launching it out of the airlock. She goes to sleep in the hibernation chamber.Aliens people in space need to check out a problem ON THE SAME PLANET AS THE FIRST ONE WHERE FOR YEARS THEY SOMEHOW NEVER NOTICED THE GIANT CRASHED ALIEN SPACECRAFT RIGHT NEXT TO THEIR COLONY. A face hugger latches on to one of the people in the colony and eventually everyone dies. Marines show up. The aliens kill the marines one by one. Turns out that once again, the company has sent someone to recover the alien as a biological weapon (what are the odds?). Doesn't work out for him either. Anyway, all the useless characters die and the three survivors are forced to escape. And then, LO AND BEHOLD, THE ALIEN HAS HITCHED A RIDE ON THE SHIP. The absolute kicker comes at the end when Ripley kills the queen. How, you ask? BY LAUNCHING IT OUT OF THE AIRLOCK (more on this later). To wrap it all up, everyone goes into hibernation at the end.How original. On to my next point 4. The marines When Cameron wrote dialogue for them, he must have had a big book of clichés to refer to. I know quite a few marines and none of them talk like that. And then there's the scene where they had to collect the ammunition. Are the marines in the future just overgrown kids in a daycare center? Never mind that right after the commander collects the ammo, he somehow doesn't notice that everyone has either put in another clip or pulled out another gun.As a sub point to that, there is that reactor thing that shouldn't be ruptured (remember? That's why all the ammo was collected). When the aliens show up there are bullets flying everywhere and amazingly, no bullets penetrate the reactor thus blowing all the marines and this horrible movie to kingdom come.5. The aliens themselves Gone is the creepiness of the alien who adapts to its environment and transforms its victims into eggs and hosts. Instead we have an overgrown ant colony which, essentially, makes this a hollow rip-off of the 1954 movie Them! At least in Them! the ants were actually scary. The aliens in Aliens seem to have gotten much stupider since the first one.6. Ripley's role So they bring her along because she's the only one to have seen the alien. That would mean that they probably figured they should listen to her. Nah, that would make too much sense. Instead, they drag her halfway across the galaxy just to tell her to shut up. She could have been left out of the movie and it wouldn't have mattered.7. The airlock scene So the alien queen is about to be sucked out the airlock, so she grabs onto Ripley's leg. Let's pretend that the laws of physics are actually at work here. Ripley's leg should have been pulled right out of its socket. But in a movie already full of incredible idiocy, at that point, it's of little consequence.I could go on but it's painful to try and relive this pathetic waste of film. I do have three good things to say about it though1. The queen looked cool. 2. Paul Reiser was the only likable character 3. Lance Henriksen was also cool, but very underused.

Barbara Stanwyck is unbelievably good, playing two characters that eventually blend into one. Her performance is on par with Katharine Hepburn's Philadelphia Story, but Hepburn had a lot more dialogue and a great deal more aspects to her character's persona to get across. While Stanwyck's attempt at an English accent is regrettable, her performance is otherwise flawless. Her conniving, seductive, confident, fun-loving, vulnerable, extroverted, and tender aspects are woven together so skillfully that you don't even question so many traits residing in one woman.Henry Fonda has been much-praised for his performance but I found it lacking. Part of that is due to poor writing -- his character is largely an easily duped buffoon who then bursts into soliloquies of such refined beauty that you wonder where his brain has been. Fonda doesn't pull it off; instead, he simply reacts to whatever is being done to him. The camera-work underscores this, focusing almost exclusively on the riveting Stanwyck. He's entirely unbelievable as an eminent scientist, since he exhibits very little rational thinking throughout the film. His expression barely alters throughout the entire film, going from befuddled to earnest and back to befuddled. Unlike Stanwyck, his face never actually *looks* highly intelligent. It's hard to understand what Stanwyck's character sees in him.This would have been a far more interesting film if almost one-third of it were cut. Sturges writes some brilliant dialogue which the actors deliver with flawless timing, but then he follows the character for what seems like endless seconds as they leave the room, enter the room, pace the room, or do whatever empty gesture soaks up some time. All the energy and sparkle created by the interchange during the scene bleeds slowly away.There is the usual Sturges montage, as boring as most. I found myself able to fast-forward through far too much of the film. (With The Philadelphia Story, for instance, you can't fast-forward without missing a critical bit of dialogue or character development.) The physical comedy would be far more interesting if he simply cut in, captured the action, and then cut out. His continually lingering camera-work mars the flow and pacing of the film.My wish is that the dead screen time could have been replaced with more sparkling dialogue. The film would be a much better picture that way. As for its being the greatest screwball comedy ever, it doesn't hold a candle to It Happened One Night and others of the Great Age of Hollywood. Perhaps Sturges should've just stuck to writing!

Her conniving, seductive, confident, fun-loving, vulnerable, extroverted, and tender aspects are woven together so skillfully that you don't even question so many traits residing in one woman.Henry Fonda has been much-praised for his performance but I found it lacking. Part of that is due to poor writing -- his character is largely an easily duped buffoon who then bursts into soliloquies of such refined beauty that you wonder where his brain has been. Fonda doesn't pull it off; instead, he simply reacts to whatever is being done to him. The camera-work underscores this, focusing almost exclusively on the riveting Stanwyck. He's entirely unbelievable as an eminent scientist, since he exhibits very little rational thinking throughout the film. His expression barely alters throughout the entire film, going from befuddled to earnest and back to befuddled. Unlike Stanwyck, his face never actually *looks* highly intelligent. It's hard to understand what Stanwyck's character sees in him.This would have been a far more interesting film if almost one-third of it were cut. Sturges writes some brilliant dialogue which the actors deliver with flawless timing, but then he follows the character for what seems like endless seconds as they leave the room, enter the room, pace the room, or do whatever empty gesture soaks up some time. All the energy and sparkle created by the interchange during the scene bleeds slowly away.There is the usual Sturges montage, as boring as most. I found myself able to fast-forward through far too much of the film. (With The Philadelphia Story, for instance, you can't fast-forward without missing a critical bit of dialogue or character development.) The physical comedy would be far more interesting if he simply cut in, captured the action, and then cut out. His continually lingering camera-work mars the flow and pacing of the film.My wish is that the dead screen time could have been replaced with more sparkling dialogue. The film would be a much better picture that way. As for its being the greatest screwball comedy ever, it doesn't hold a candle to It Happened One Night and others of the Great Age of Hollywood. Perhaps Sturges should've just stuck to writing!

The original was a game of wits between characters in a claustrophobic setting; this one plays out more like a monster movie.It really resembles Rose Red and an earlier flick, House that Dripped Blood, with the house itself seeming to breathe a life of its own, so maybe the Dripped Blood title would have been more accurate. Only the sinister funeral march of hearses at the beginning, and the challenge\/reward offered by the host has been kept intact (although there's an added useless scene preceding this at an amusement park, for whatever reason).The host sports a thin Vincent Price mustache, and is named Mr. Price (get it, yuk yuk). At that point, forget about the plot of the original. The film throws in characters from everywhere, dark tunnels, electro-shock therapy, spinning carousels, psychotic episodes, the screaming teens cliché (except they're 30-somethings, a little old to be teens), people using that same old thoroughly exhausted curse word because the ingenious script can't think of anything more original, and some monsters that pop in and out in poorly blue-tinted cinematography where you can hardly see what's going on. The acting is pretty awful, especially by the screeching Harry Potter look-alike.To be fair, it should be said that there are some isolated moments of horror scares. The movie can be entertaining as cheap, cinematic fast food, the kind you see on Sci-Fi channel on weekend afternoons. However, there are also parts where it's about as scary as that 3 Stooges episode where Curley is chased around a haunted house by a balloon with a grinning face.

For example, the day that the women of this film experience is unlikely to occur in an Almodóvar work today.Mostly I mean the level of craziness and the absurd. His last film, Volver, finds a lot of women living 'at the verge of a nervous breakdown' (as the title of this movie translates in English), and although they are about to loose their minds at times, they don't find the same taxi driver three times when they stop a cab in different parts of a big city on a same day&#133; That's delirious!But what's even more delirious is that Almodóvar's writing, with a perfect eye for understanding the female conscience, seems completely real but is cut off by situations like the one I've just mentioned; and that's a beautiful contrast. It's like watching a middle shot of Pepa (Carmen Maura) talking on the phone that suddenly changes to a close-up of her fast walking red high heels; it's like hearing things a woman in a difficult situation would think, but listening to the woman saying them out loud. I don't know if Almodóvar would want to explain what Mujeres&#133; is about; maybe he'd prefer that you watch it without reading anything about it. I could just tell you it involves a woman (Pepa) having an affair with a man that left his sick wife and his nerdy son, who's involved with an ugly desperate woman that goes with him to visit an apartment to buy and the apartment is Pepa's, who at the moment is being visited by a girlfriend who's scared because her ex-boyfriend turned out to be a terrorist&#133;Don't say that you would have preferred I hadn't told you anything.This is one of Almodóvar's first works, but don't forget this is the man who afterwards made semi-autobiographical pictures with risky images and character dramas with ruthless and pathetic characters. As a director, Almodóvar makes all his films look practically the same (the cinematography of the ever efficient Jose Luis Alcaine), although here the score is from a thrilling (Bernardo Bonezzi), before Alberto Iglesias started collaborating with Pedro. Which takes us to the differentiating factor in an Almodóvar film the screenplay, in this movie as always highlighted by the classic credits screenplay and direction. Better than anything else, we find Almodóvar the writer, capable of creating (in this piece) wonderful characters speaking all the same time in a small room where you can understand everything and you don't stop laughing.And therefore the performances shine; here by means of a unique and impossible to replace Carmen Maura, a beautifully over the top Julieta Serrano, a hilarious María Barranco and an unrecognizable Antonio Banderas, who shows here that he was probably something like an actor during a time of his life; Almodóvar allowed me to see that.

I was a big fan of the popular sitcom, Malcolm in the Middle at the time, and knew that Frankie Muniz, who played Malcolm, played the starring role in this family comedy. If it wasn't for him, I probably wouldn't have seen it. During my first viewing, even though it's a kids' movie, I liked it. However, watching it a second time, a few years later, I was not so impressed, noticing some annoyances which I didn't remember from before! Jason Shepherd is a fourteen-year-old boy with a tendency to tell tall tales. On his way to get his creative writing assignment, entitled Big Fat Liar, handed in on time to avoid failing English, he crashes into limousine! Fortunately, he is not injured, but he requests a quick ride to his destination. Inside is Marty Wolf, a movie producer. When Jason gets out, he accidentally leaves his paper inside! He then tries to tell Ms. Caldwell and his parents what happened, but pays the price for all his fibs, as they don't believe him, so he fails the class and summer school is his only option. During the summer, he learns that Marty Wolf is making a movie out of his story, but once again, because of his many tall tales, he can't convince his parents that he wrote it! However, while his parents are away for a few days, Jason flies with his friend, Kaylee to Los Angeles to try and get Marty to admit the truth! Unfortunately, at first, they don't realize that Marty is a completely self-centred jerk, and revealing the truth about Big Fat Liar will be harder than Jason originally thought! After my second viewing, I'll admit that I laughed a few times, such as after Jason and Kaylee sneak blue dye into Marty's pool and orange dye into his shampoo bottle, with his reaction and what ensues as he drives along the road. (Using the Eiffel 65 song, Blue for that road scene adds to the amusement.) However, the occasional laughs were not enough to make to whole experience worthwhile for me. The movie has some pretty annoying lines, such as Kaylee, you got a plunger? I took a dookie and clogged up the toilet. Oh, no, look at this! What a mess!, which could amuse a lot of kids, but obviously not too many other people. There are some lines in the movie which may not be as bad as the one above, but they could certainly still annoy adult viewers. I also personally found a lot (probably most) of the story a bit boringSince I was an adolescent by the time the 2000s began, I haven't seen too many other kids' movies like this one that have come out sometime in recent years. I'm sure there have been worse movies of this type than Big Fat Liar, but remember, this IS a kids' movie. So, for kids who like slapstick and silliness, this movie could be very entertaining. Some adults might find it amusing to a certain degree (especially parents), while others would probably hate it. I'm somewhere in between those two, so that kind of view on the movie is possible as well. While I personally don't think much of the movie, I will give it credit for the entertainment value it has for kids (possibly some adults as well), and for the moral to the story, about telling the truth.

What some characterized as a cheap ripoff of Rookie of the Year, was nothing of the sort. Time has given us the distance and wisdom to take a second look at this little gem. And with that vision we can see a modern day American tragedy. A pure classic in all terms of the word.Little Big League tells to story of 12 year-old Billy Haywood and his adventure of managing the Minnesota Twins baseball club. The prepubescent Billy has a rocky start at the beginning of the film, struggling to earn his players' respect and trust. But the turbulent times steady themselves and Billy leads the team to a winning record and a chance at the AL Wild Card. Intertwined into the ball season is the love story between 1st baseman Lou Collins and Billy's mom Jenny.Partway through, Billy grows encumbered with the pressures of managing a major league baseball team and his growing oedipal jealousies. Things spill over onto the ball field and results in Billy benching star Lou.Not to worry because Billy finds his way again. Right where it was the whole time. A magical scene shows him joining in a neighborhood stick ball game and reconnecting with the reasons he became a major league manager in the first place. Things are set right soon after when Billy reinstates Lou and gives his mom a big hug. With a renewed Billy at the helm, the team finds their stride just in time to finish the season tied for the Wild Card. The only thing standing in their way is a playoff game with Ken Griffey Jr's Seattle Mariners.Personally, I was on the edge of my seat through the whole playoff game scene. The battle goes back and forth into extra innings. Finally, the film climaxes with a duel between Randy Johnson (himself) and a last ditch at bat by Lou.Just when we think Lou Collins shot to deep left will clear the fence and we'll see the team we've grown to love run out onto the field as winners and Little Big League will give us what we want most, Ken Griffey Jr. jumps up to rob us all. For every story of champions, is the another story. The story of the losers. Essentially, that is what Little Big League is; a story of loss. A tragedy.But like Shakespeare's Hamlet and Arthur Miller's Willy Loman, LBL drags us kicking and screaming to the awful truth. We cannot all win the 1994 AL Wild Card. Someone has to be Billy Haywood. Somebody has to walk back to the clubhouse with their head down. But just when Billy thinks the last light is about to go out, he is informed that the fans are still there. They are still...cheering. And just when we think the emotional roller coaster ride of LBL has gone over it's last hill, it climbs to a momentous conclusion. They are still cheering.It's an essential part of the human drama. And LBL lets us know. It's O.K. We can still cheer for the loser. For what is more noble then knowing that we left it all on the field.

Having heard so much about this movie for so many years, by so many people, I expected at least something solid, but no. This movie sucks in every possible respect.It is far too long. Long and utterly pointless scenes, like the one where the theatrical company is rehearsing Hamlet, add nothing to further the movie.The scenography is a joke. Overdriven and not at all well composed. Except perhaps at the odd home of the Jew. I know the movie was lauded for precisely its scenography, but that was highly undeserved.The acting isn't much better. The only exception being Jarl Kulle, the bearded bonvivant who laid all those women. The cutting of the movie is, what? Nonexistent. Ingmar Bergman must have been so in love with this deformed monster of a movie he couldn't bring himself to cut away much from it.So what's it all about? Nothing. There's no story, no glue holding it all together, no point.We're offered one scene where the family is preparing for and celebrating Christmas. A funeral, a marriage ceremony, a baptism fiest. Standard Hollywood-style fillers when the author has nothing much to say. A house tyrant in the form of a bishop and a couple of entirely uninteresting intercourses.The title is somewhat misleading. The Fanny character is close to being just a cameo. Alexander is a 9yo boy who most of the time looks and acts like a zombie. And he's generally completely uninteresting.For people who aren't Swedes, a couple of explanations to what the movie *really* is about.Sweden is a strange mix of a socialist and fascist society. The fascist part is how the economic system is set up. In Sweden, most of your economic dealings are with the State. Our tax burden is somewhere around 85%, so normal people must apply for various hand-outs from the State and the commune they live in. Tax cheating and evasion are very common. And the authorities silently let people get away with it. That way no one in the country has a clean nose and no one can point the finger to those in power, who steal and cheat the most.If you're a company, cuddling up to your commune and\/or State often means you'll get tax breaks, subventioned loans, generous zoning laws etc. And that's nice. But if you for some reason DON'T cuddle up, or rather DON'T suck up, you'll be sabotaged by the authorities on every level of your dealing with them.Which brings us to the great parasitic layer of society called artists and other euphemisms for privileged upper-class or upper middle class people who aren't talented enough, or are too lazy, to do some productive work.There is only one single employer and buyer for everything that has something to do with art in Sweden, the State. Whether you're a painter, sculptor, or film maker, the State is your breastfeeding Mother. The State pays you, finances your projects, sells your name abroad etc. So every artist in Sweden must be utterly politically correct in order to not infuriate Mother.The problem here is that these same undeserving so called artists don't want to accept the reality of what they are, useless parasites for whose work nobody cares, except the State comissions and other useless parasites of the same ilk.

The fascist part is how the economic system is set up. In Sweden, most of your economic dealings are with the State.

And the authorities silently let people get away with it. That way no one in the country has a clean nose and no one can point the finger to those in power, who steal and cheat the most.If you're a company, cuddling up to your commune and\/or State often means you'll get tax breaks, subventioned loans, generous zoning laws etc. And that's nice. But if you for some reason DON'T cuddle up, or rather DON'T suck up, you'll be sabotaged by the authorities on every level of your dealing with them.Which brings us to the great parasitic layer of society called artists and other euphemisms for privileged upper-class or upper middle class people who aren't talented enough, or are too lazy, to do some productive work.There is only one single employer and buyer for everything that has something to do with art in Sweden, the State. Whether you're a painter, sculptor, or film maker, the State is your breastfeeding Mother. The State pays you, finances your projects, sells your name abroad etc. So every artist in Sweden must be utterly politically correct in order to not infuriate Mother.The problem here is that these same undeserving so called artists don't want to accept the reality of what they are, useless parasites for whose work nobody cares, except the State comissions and other useless parasites of the same ilk.

It's a direct approach to call it autobiography, which I would imagine it is for not just Spike Lee (who could be seen, more or less, as the one Carmichael kid who wears big glasses and is obsessed with the Knicks), but Joie (the lead Troy perhaps ?) and Cinque (one of the younger kids I'd suppose as the youngest Lee sibling), who all wrote the script. It's about a family getting by and going through the struggles of the small kind (change the channel, turn off the TV, don't bother your sister\/brother, did you steal that from him, etc) to the larger issues (parents arguing over money) that many families in urban sections of the cities have to go through every day. Only here the family is sassy, rude, cool, a little square, a little hip, and very identifiable in one aspect or another in just how siblings relate, how the neighbors get on nerves (in this case with a slight racial edge, it is a Spike Lee movie after all), and yet deep down lots of love all around.The Lee's inject a good deal of humor and warmth for a good 2\/3 of the film, even when Spike moves the scene down south where Troy (Zelda Harris) has to stay with relatives for a little while, and Lee takes off the widescreen anamorphic process in order to make it a consistently distorted image. This is actually quite a cool move, if at first a little uneasy, as it goes in and out sometimes of looking like its distorted and then it will look like the characters and set pieces are skinny and such (the fate of the relative's dog, by the way, is one of the biggest, if cruelest, laughs in the whole film). At Crooklyn's best, there's a whole feeling to the proceedings, much like Do the Right Thing- and going back as well to the early work of Scorsese- where just a small section of New York city opens up to the viewer as being as vivid and true as possible that the lack of a usual plot doesn't matter much. Sometimes a scene might not work quite as much as another, or one of the many songs Lee lays on (and there are many, as it's one of the best soundtracks he's presented) overrides what could do without in the scene.

It's a sudden shift in the story that doesn't really feel as true as it could, almost as if Lee and his sibling writers don't know where to go once Troy gets back except to go towards sentimentality. It's still well-acted, particularly by Delroy Lindo, who overall gives one of his best performances to date as the struggling father of the family, but it's an odd jolt that doesn't rightly click (especially with a bit where a funeral scene is interrupted by what looks like a dream scene involving Spike himself, sporting a big afro, as a target of Troy's). And yet, I wouldn't stop anyone from seeing the Crooklyn, if they want to get to see some of the less politically charged and more personal and bittersweet side of Lee, and for those who have fond memories of New York (and TV or the Knicks) in the 70s.

","genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance"},{"date":"4 August 2007","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":" What we have with Training Day is a big mixture of gangster, crime, cop\/buddy and something close to resembling a ghetto drama all in one. Needless to say that all these aspects of the film work together in a reasonably effective way which, in the end, leaves you feeling satisfied. There are individual strokes of greatness but these are limited to things like Denzil Washington's performance who reminded me of a Wesley Snipes character out of something like 'New Jack City' (1991). There is also the element of unpredictability for the best part as relative rookie Jake (Hawke) gets put through some pretty harsh paces for the first forty minutes or so.I came away from Training Day liking it overall but there were some distinct things that had me thinking to myself 'Yeah, I see exactly what they're trying to do here.' And this is relatable to the 'buddy\/cop' sequence. Jake and Alonzo (Washington) are the absolute binary opposites of one another you couldn't get two more different characters. One is a 'desk' cop who books illegally parked cars and probably takes the odd trip to the doughnut shop one too many times (although his build doesn't suggest this) whereas Alonzo is one of those cops you see in films and if you were ever going to become a law enforcer, you'd want to live their lifestyle guns, girls and plenty of softly earned drug money. Although this is nothing new, it was refreshing to see it done in an unpredictable manner and of course, Washington's performance sees it out.Secondly, the way in which each character acts &#150; Jake seems sharper and wants to do everything by the book whereas Alonzo's methods include something more reminiscent of instead of arresting two rapists, just threaten in an extreme manner to shoot their genitalia off if they catch them doing it again and let them go. Jake even talks and dresses differently and of course, Ethan Hawke is a white Caucasian American &#150; Washington is coloured so these two characters make for great entertainment in an easily explosive situation when you've got two people so different in looks and lifestyles.Thanks to some good film-making, certain situations of tension and spontaneity happen and are carried out well. These situations are also very awkward and since we're supposed to map onto the character of Jake more so than Alonzo, we do sort of feel what he's feeling &#150; again, this is thanks to Washington's amazing performance; especially when he either forces Jake to take a smoke of some drugs or when someone is unexpectedly shot and Jake is panting heavily or even when they drive though a bad neighbourhood and Alonzo states 'Don't you ever come here without me' as black ghetto gangsters eye up the vehicle.

Needless to say that all these aspects of the film work together in a reasonably effective way which, in the end, leaves you feeling satisfied. There are individual strokes of greatness but these are limited to things like Denzil Washington's performance who reminded me of a Wesley Snipes character out of something like 'New Jack City' (1991). There is also the element of unpredictability for the best part as relative rookie Jake (Hawke) gets put through some pretty harsh paces for the first forty minutes or so.I came away from Training Day liking it overall but there were some distinct things that had me thinking to myself 'Yeah, I see exactly what they're trying to do here.' And this is relatable to the 'buddy\/cop' sequence. Jake and Alonzo (Washington) are the absolute binary opposites of one another you couldn't get two more different characters. One is a 'desk' cop who books illegally parked cars and probably takes the odd trip to the doughnut shop one too many times (although his build doesn't suggest this) whereas Alonzo is one of those cops you see in films and if you were ever going to become a law enforcer, you'd want to live their lifestyle guns, girls and plenty of softly earned drug money. Although this is nothing new, it was refreshing to see it done in an unpredictable manner and of course, Washington's performance sees it out.Secondly, the way in which each character acts &#150; Jake seems sharper and wants to do everything by the book whereas Alonzo's methods include something more reminiscent of instead of arresting two rapists, just threaten in an extreme manner to shoot their genitalia off if they catch them doing it again and let them go. Jake even talks and dresses differently and of course, Ethan Hawke is a white Caucasian American &#150; Washington is coloured so these two characters make for great entertainment in an easily explosive situation when you've got two people so different in looks and lifestyles.Thanks to some good film-making, certain situations of tension and spontaneity happen and are carried out well.
