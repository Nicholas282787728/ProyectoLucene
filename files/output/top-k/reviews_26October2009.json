Not as consistently funny as the first but it was still very entertaining with basically Buzz and Woody changing roles and attitudes and new characters like Jessie, Bullseye, and Stinky Pete adding to the appealing characters lineup. Also, Randy Newman added some new songs like the wistfully sad one called When She Loved Me sung by Sarah McLachlan or the Woody's Roundup TV show theme performed by Riders in the Sky. The additional characters are voiced by such familiar talents like Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammar, and as Al of Al's Toy Barn, Wayne Knight. Like I said, it takes a while before the laughs came but when they did, they provided more fun entertainment for the recent 3-D double feature of this and the original Toy Story that I just rewatched with my movie theatre working friend. So on that note, rush to this and its predecessor as soon as you can! P.S. My friend that I just mentioned noticed a character mention our current hometown of Baton Rouge in the airport scene. R.I.P Jim Varney and Robert Goulet who warbled You've Got a Friend in Me at the end. And those bloopers during the end credits are still sooooo hilarious!

Another one of those movies I've waited years to see, I can finally cross this off my list. But for some reason, I'm not lighting fireworks and dancing around a bonfire. Maybe I was expecting too much - after all, it has all the big-name stars you could ever want and one of my favourite directors in the big chair, Tim Burton. By taking a well-worn genre and infusing it with his typically dark vision, Burton has fashioned a quirky and entertaining sci-fi blast that ticks every cliché you could imagine. But whether it's a dark fable on resisting the American Dream or simply an excuse to zap recognisable faces, this is one film that dares to be different from every other alien film and to be frank, that's as good a reason as any to celebrate.As the Hubble telescope spots hundreds of flying saucer-shaped things flying over from Mars, President James Dale (Jack Nicholson) is torn between welcoming the alien visitors and blowing them out of the sky. Convinced by Professor Kessler (Pierce Brosnan) that they mean us no harm, President Dale addresses the nation on this historic moment. But for some, there are more important things to deal with. Nathalie Lake (Sarah Jessica Parker) sees the aliens as an opportunity for a great talk show, tycoon Art Land (Nicholson again) isn't going to let the aliens ruin him opening his new casino and journalist Jason Stone (Michael J Fox) senses the scoop of the century. Sadly, these aliens have only two things on their massive minds - total annihilation of the Earth and having some fun while they're at it.In all the mayhem, it's easy to lose track of who is doing what and why with the exception of the aliens themselves. Truth be told, the aliens get the biggest laughs - not only do they look fabulous but they have the funniest scenes such as taking photos of themselves in front of the exploding Taj Mahal or the slightly creepy undercover Martian girl (Lisa Marie) with White House Press Secretary Jerry Ross (Martin Short). The look of the film is quite unique in a way I unexpected, like Burton's reimagining of Charlie And The Chocolate Factory but surprisingly, it doesn't detract too much from the movie as a whole. The cast, by contrast, do exactly that - each actor feels like they're actually playing themselves but the only one who is isn't an actor at all. Tom Jones' appearance in the second half is as ridiculous as it is sublime but sadly, all too brief. But as each star wrestles for screen time, I couldn't help thinking it was repeating the same mistake that Ocean's Twelve did. Simply throwing big name actors at the screen isn't enough to make a movie entertaining which is why the aliens are the true stars of Mars Attacks!.It sounds like I've got a bit of a downer on this movie but I really haven't. I enjoyed the sheer sense of fun, despite scores of people being reduced to coloured skeletons and their component atoms. It's much more fun than the recent War Of The Worlds remake as well as being a delightful poke in the eye for overly patriotic disaster flicks like Independence Day or The Day After Tomorrow. For that, I can only applaud Burton for crafting a wonderfully silly alien movie with just enough darkness to keep kids behind the sofa. It's like that classic British sci-fi series Dr Who - full of special effects and deadly alien weapons but with a cheeky glint in its eye to tell you not to worry too much. Mars Attacks! isn't Burton's best film and neither will it appeal to everyone - it's just too weird - but it's still worth seeking out if you haven't seen it yet. Just make sure you don't wait 13 years before watching it as you'll probably be let down.

There are some ridiculous moments (the comic-book scene being a particular low point) but everything is made a little more palatable thanks to Freddy's sardonic sense of humour and playfulness. It also helps that, once again, there are plenty of good special effects on hand to please fans of Freddy's inventive killing methods.The cast are all either eminently disposable or, in the case of Wilcox and Whitby Hertford, very good with characters given a little more to do than the other potential victims. Then there's Robert Englund, who let's nothing detract from his seemingly never-ending ability to have a great time as the razor-fingered, scarred, comic killer.Fans of the gloved one will find some things to enjoy in this outing but it's definitely not quite as easy to derive the fun from the series as it once was.See this if you like Labyrinth, A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 The Dream Master, Freddy's Dead The Final Nightmare.

This is where Bond looked really goofy and did nothing at all. And this is perfectly polished yet foolish after all ! After the first flame of (Dr. No &#x96; 1962) the Bond-ish formula has been fired. Then (From Russia with Love &#x96; 1963) came to show us the respectable spy face of Bond. Then, clearly and in no time, the formula overcame and ruled in (Goldfinger &#x96; 1964) and ever since.Wanna know what's good in here? Take a list  The talents  Gert Frobe as (Auric Goldfinger). He was real believable as Bond's evil man. The Jazzy orchestra of John Barry. Ted Moore's smooth cinematography. And Connery' handsomeness, manly charisma, and full suits.Plus the wild naughty moments  Bond slaps a girl's butt (Hurray for the 1960s !). Shirley Eaton's black, so outrageous, bikini. Shirley Eaton being only in a blue shirt on bed. Shirley Eaton's supposedly naked body all painted in gold. The double meaning too wicked lines. And, of course, the matter of (Pussy Galore) apart. Actually, when Connery replays after hearing the name for the first time,  I must be dreaming you've got to know that the 1960s was the dream he was dreaming of ! Then the classics  Oddjob's killer hat, the car's flying seat, the killer laser beam, and No Mr. Bond. I expect you to DIE !. Some of this stuff look so ridiculous and fatuous nowadays, but not yesterday.On the other hand  The plot is laughable. The characters are uninteresting cartoon. The conflict is idiot (Goldfinger got chances to kill Bond many times, though strangely he didn't !). I hated the wrong info about the so-called skin suffocation; this is sci-fi at its worst. I saw the camera's shadow so visible when Connery woke up to find the golden corpse (How Shameful). The image turns into funny fast-motion while the fight of Bond and Oddjob! And the climax wasn't that hot (at least like its many likes afterwards !). Sean Connery won the Golden Laurel for the best Action Performance in a 1964's movie ! Well, I didn't see him behind his hair piece much! And all what he had done here is nothing but getting Pussy.. I..I mean on his side! Despite that it was the mad mad mad 60s but they couldn't say anything about her fact as a lesbian as she was in the original novel. So even Bond's big effort at that matter, rather the only effort he made, wasn't given the appreciation it deserved! It's not a movie about spying. Not an action I esteem. It's a memory from the 1960s about the 1960s. In fact while the retreat of the traditional western, the musicals, and the invasion of the new wave, and the existential movies, (Goldfinger) assured more than any other movie that it's just a fate that Bond is here to stay and own the commercial throne, being as absurd and sexy as it is only. Simply that's the kind of imagination and fluff that were intensively desired in the cold war-era (You maybe can understand its role and feel its taste rightly while watching the spoofs of Austin Powers movies 35 years after).So after 1964 and during the whole 1960s OH MY GOD the Bond's offspring will lead all over the world (OSS 117, Flint, Agent 077, Matt Helm, Kommissar X, A Man Called Dagger, Agente Gordon, etcetera etcetera..) with the girlie versions, the TV shows, the parodies and let's not forget the original Bond as well! Hence, the something that Came Up in (Goldfinger) is the victory of its formulaic &#x96; yet so entertaining and anesthetic &#x96; hero, built and elements.That was these days' fun. True that (Goldfinger) is gold plated for me. But I love its sexual spices and strange uniqueness (as, for one reason, the most expensive, silly and successful cartoon was made back then!). So as a good history lesson about what the audience needed on a day once; here's where its real gold shines.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"26 October 2009","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" This is a piece from the 1960s that says a lot about it. This is where Bond looked really goofy and did nothing at all. And this is perfectly polished yet foolish after all ! After the first flame of (Dr. No &#x96; 1962) the Bond-ish formula has been fired. Then (From Russia with Love &#x96; 1963) came to show us the respectable spy face of Bond. Then, clearly and in no time, the formula overcame and ruled in (Goldfinger &#x96; 1964) and ever since.Wanna know what's good in here? Take a list  The talents  Gert Frobe as (Auric Goldfinger). He was real believable as Bond's evil man. The Jazzy orchestra of John Barry. Ted Moore's smooth cinematography. And Connery' handsomeness, manly charisma, and full suits.Plus the wild naughty moments  Bond slaps a girl's butt (Hurray for the 1960s !). Shirley Eaton's black, so outrageous, bikini. Shirley Eaton being only in a blue shirt on bed. Shirley Eaton's supposedly naked body all painted in gold. The double meaning too wicked lines. And, of course, the matter of (Pussy Galore) apart. Actually, when Connery replays after hearing the name for the first time,  I must be dreaming you've got to know that the 1960s was the dream he was dreaming of ! Then the classics  Oddjob's killer hat, the car's flying seat, the killer laser beam, and No Mr. Bond. I expect you to DIE !. Some of this stuff look so ridiculous and fatuous nowadays, but not yesterday.On the other hand  The plot is laughable. The characters are uninteresting cartoon. The conflict is idiot (Goldfinger got chances to kill Bond many times, though strangely he didn't !). I hated the wrong info about the so-called skin suffocation; this is sci-fi at its worst. I saw the camera's shadow so visible when Connery woke up to find the golden corpse (How Shameful). The image turns into funny fast-motion while the fight of Bond and Oddjob! And the climax wasn't that hot (at least like its many likes afterwards !). Sean Connery won the Golden Laurel for the best Action Performance in a 1964's movie ! Well, I didn't see him behind his hair piece much! And all what he had done here is nothing but getting Pussy.. I..I mean on his side! Despite that it was the mad mad mad 60s but they couldn't say anything about her fact as a lesbian as she was in the original novel. So even Bond's big effort at that matter, rather the only effort he made, wasn't given the appreciation it deserved! It's not a movie about spying. Not an action I esteem. It's a memory from the 1960s about the 1960s. In fact while the retreat of the traditional western, the musicals, and the invasion of the new wave, and the existential movies, (Goldfinger) assured more than any other movie that it's just a fate that Bond is here to stay and own the commercial throne, being as absurd and sexy as it is only.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"26 October 2009","score":"","review":" I had an interesting reaction to F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu A Symphony of Horror. At no point in watching this film did I feel any genuine, visceral terror. Even though it features one of the most physically off-putting characters of all time, the movie never actually gave me the shivers. That came about an hour later, as I was tossing and turning around, trying to fall asleep. Lying in that dark empty room, I kept on picturing the movie's iconic images of a corpse-like vampire crouching over his victims as they slept. I kept on imagining my closet doors as the castle passages in the film, and that at some point, they were going to swing open under their own power. One minute, they would be vacant, and the next there would be Count Orlok walking unhurriedly, striving to quench his thirst for blood. That kept me up through all hours of the night.For me, the terror came not in the actual moment of viewing, but afterward. I have seen Nosferatu four or five times in the past couple of years, and each time, it has registered the same effect on me. It has a haunting quality that cannot be ignored, even if it is not as viscerally gripping as it probably was to the people who first saw it ninety years ago. And although it does not make my blood pump like some other entries in the horror genre, it is not, save for a small stretch in the middle, a dull experience. It is full of unforgettable images and a quintessential, of-its-time atmosphere.Perhaps the movie's grandest achievement is the ever-going presence of its villain. And that is really saying something, seeing as how Count Orlok, the titular nosferatu, only has about ten minutes of screen time to his name. Ignoring his physical grandeur, one can feel the vampire's authority hanging over every scene like a specter. One that cannot be fought off or evaded, that is until an innocent maiden sticks her neck out (literally) to save Europe. In this sense, Nosferatu is a defining example of German Expressionism an art movement prevalent in the movies as well as paintings during the 20th century in which the creator would provide an inner feeling through some distorted version of reality. And what distorted version of reality would work better than the idea of vampires carcasses rising from the earth to feed on the flesh of the living. No matter how many times our parents remind us that these are just fictional entities, most of us can never quite shake the impression that there are some things in this world we cannot explain or expect. Especially when it's late at night, and you are all alone in a dark house.But the vampire's physical presence cannot be ignored, either. I do not know how much is owed to Max Schreck's performance as Count Orlok or the fabulous make-up work, whose creator I really wish I could name. But this is one of the most visually memorable characters in cinema history. Count Orlok is not so much a man as he is a rodent. He bears no hair of his own, pointed little ears, a narrow lower jaw eerily reminiscent of a snout, and big expressionless eyes with heavy dark shadows hanging beneath them. But best of all are the fangs, positioned smack-dab in the middle of the upper maw&#x85;again, much more like a rat than a man. Add to that Max Schreck's lean, limber posture and stiff movements (movements deliberately slow, as they are made by a creature with no reason to hurry) and Count Orlok quickly becomes visually disturbing. He may not terrify us as he did nine decades ago, but the image of a corpse-like vampire continues to haunt us.Certain elements of Nosferatu have dated, most of them the simple practical camera tricks that director F.W. Murnau had to utilize to suggest a supernatural element. But to his credit, he does apply them enough times so that the kitsch element wears off and we start buying them as part of this world. For instance, Count Orlok's carriage footage of horses pulling a rig played at irregularly fast speed. By today's standards, and keeping in mind that it was very easy to over-crank a camera by accident in the silent era, the effect does look silly. As do some of the time-lapse shots of coffin lids crawling upon their boxes. Whether it was Mr. Murnau's genius or just lucky accidents, the constant usage of these tricks do eventually, as the film progresses, seem to meld it and become part of this fantasy.There is a twenty-minute stretch in the middle, as the vampire travels from Transylvania to (I believe) Germany that loses an overall sense of pacing. And a surprisingly lengthy meanwhile back home sequence, with a German professor lecturing about Venus fly traps is flat-out dull, in spite of its metaphors. But other than that, this is an undeniably impressive motion picture from one of the genre's greatest talents. Since the movie is available in several versions, I do feel obligated to briefly comment on them. To put it brief, get a hold of the recent, restored version by Kino International. The movie is given appropriate color tints to suggest day and night (and destroying the error of black-and-white prints in which it was clear that Nosferatu, supposed to be instantly killed by sunlight, is walking around in day without ill effect), and there are none of those added sound effects like crows cawing or doors creaking. There is one version that used these to the hilt and rendered some of the film's best moments unbearable. I'm sure there are some silent filmmaker who would have tossed in these kitschy additions to 'enhance' their movies had the technology been available to them at the time, but I doubt F.W. Murnau would have been one of them. ","genre":null},{"date":"26 October 2009","score":"","review":" I had an interesting reaction to F.W. Murnau's Nosferatu A Symphony of Horror.

Anyway, I cannot stop myself from writing few words for this amazing movie. It is probably one of the best ever made movies in its genre. Here it is, in few words, what the movie suggested to me. The whole movie is a metaphor to the human being, the passing through life and memories. I would like to consider it more philosophical than science-fiction. The human being is represented in this movie by the three characters Stalker (The Human Instinct\/Subconscious), The Professor (The Human Rationale\/ The Reasoning) and the Writer (The Human Imagination\/Humanism).All three are going together in the Zone and they never go one without each other. The target is The Room where you can have all your wishes come true. This Room would be like any ideal in life, you try to achieve it but you will never be able to do it. The whole trip to the Room is like the way in life. Never straight and clear, with a lot of strange things and a lot of details. The wolf in the movie represents DEATH. It comes closer to the Stalker when he sleeps ( I understood that when we sleep, we are the closest to the death state). I am not quite clear what represents Stalker's wife and daughter.

This film is base on the novella 《Traumnovelle》 (Dream Story), written by Arthur Schnitzler, who Freud claimed had such an intimate affinity with. Kubrick had spent decades of time adapted the novella to the motion picture. With joint effort of two greatest minds, the film is among the most profound ones, so that requires great effort to interpret. In the very beginning of the film, Bill walked from the living room, through the bedroom, towards bathroom. This move provides us a clear establishment inside this New York couple's house. The view is clearly described by Tim Kreider as, The paintings that cover the Harfords' walls from floor to ceiling (painted by Kubrick's wife Christiane) almost all depict flowers or food, making explicit the function of art in their environment as mere decor-art for consumption. Then followed, Alice, who just finished using the bathroom stand up, made her first frontal appearance. This obvious continuity between the paintings and Alice, combining the starting scene which displayed her naked back, implied that our main female character was also an art work that the main male character had collected. When Alice asked Bill why he wasn't jealous, the answer Bill gave is Because you are my wife and the mother of my child. What he had in mind was that Alice was something he owned rather than the person he shared a life with. Alice talked about her fantasy to Bill that she was ready to give up every thing, including her family and her child just because of the glance of the naval officer. She was saying that in order to protest the Bill's ownership. This revealed more of the submissive position where Alice stood --- Always leading by the male. Her appearance was always associated with the mirror. As analysis in Lacan's theoryThe mirror stage is a phenomenon to which I assign a twofold value. In the first place, it has historical value as it marks a decisive turning-point in the mental development of the child. In the second place, it typifies an essential libidinal relationship with the body image Alice constantly behavior of checking the mirror indicates of her loss of self-identification. She was familiar with being a wife and a mother---the ego characteristics required by the society. Alice looked like a serious person, wearing glasses, hardly smile. Not until she was on alcohol, pot or during dreaming, did the relax expression appeared on her face. From this we would know she repressed lots of her own desires, hide the tension, the anxiety deep down, so as to meet the demand of her husband and the society. However, when she was unconscious, she couldn't control of the desires and just let it out. The night, Bill came home from the orgy party, found her giggling during her sleep. But when woke up, she look very terrified. The transition from sleep to awaken is analog with the transition form unconscious to conscious. The four step of dream interpretation secondary revision could be applied to the dramatic attitude changing from being satisfied to being terrified. She feels guilty about dream cheating of her husband so she forced herself as remembering the dream as a horrific nightmare.Bill maintained his dominant poison, identified himself as the role of the saver, using money to control people such as costume shop owner, the taxi driver and ultimately since he was the only financial support of the family, using money to control Alice. When he wanted to do something that considered as immoral or transgression, he start to searching through the unconscious to find the excuses to keep him away from being guilty. The fantasies of his wife making love with the naval officer occurring three times, each followed by the action of searching other women to fulfill his sexual needs, hooking up with the prostitute, calling his late patient's daughter who expressed her desires for him before and going to the orgy party. He needed the reason for the self gratification. And the idea of revenge to his wife's fantasized infidelity severed him well. From this we can indicate that Bill indeed is a very hypocritical person. He spared no effort finding ways to satisfy his id desires while his wife Alice tried really hard to repress it. I think the scene which he found that the mask lying on his pillow implied that he, not his wife, is the person who cheated and disguised as an honest man. Every detail in this film is carefully designed. The name of prostitute the domino is actually a kind of mask, which predicted the following masque in held in the Somerton. The password of the party is Fidelio, which was the Italian for faithful. It's severs as an irony because using such word as engaging into an orgy. Also, Fidelio is Beethoven' opera telling the story of how a wife risked her life to save her husband in prison from death. It predicted the result that in the end Mandy sacrificed herself to protect Bill's life. It also was using stairs as a metaphor for social class and the dirt inside the upper ones. The higher you climb, the more bodies you might discovered in their closets. Just as the saying goes There is nothing accidental in Kubrick's film.

Tarentino's films make you laugh even a parts that aren't supposed to be funny. Pulp fiction is a masterpiece.The film is a story of Vincent Vega and his friend Jules, two hit men. Vincent is asked by his boss to watch his wife(Played by Uma Thurman) for a night and gets her drugged up. Or she gets herself drugged up.Jules is thinking of retiring. The two guys get into some crazy situations. Another storyline in the film involves as boxer named Butch(Played by Bruce Willis) who is being hunted down by the Marsallis Wallace(played by Ving Rhames). That is who Vincent works for. The two of them get into some pretty crazy situations. Both of these tales are intertwined in a brilliant way. I forgot to mention another story plot. There is a couple(played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) who decide to rob a restaurant. A smart idea I think. All of these stories are intertwined in a brilliant fashion. This movie has some memorable scenes and quotes. Pulp fiction is a real classic and the comeback of John Travolta. All of the performances are great. In Be cool, they make many references to this movie. Perhaps not many, but a few. They really didn't have to. Because those who have seen this movie sure as hell aren't going to forget it.Pulp fiction****\/**** ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"26 October 2009","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" You know what's weird? My mom was the biggest Steve Martin fan you would ever meet, she had(what I thought) all of his movies and watched every biography on him. So since she had a lot of his movies, I watched most of them with her. But my boyfriend kept telling me about a film called St. Bilko and how hilarious it was. I was stumped, I couldn't find it in my mom's collection nor did I ever hear of it. So my boyfriend and I went shopping and he found it on DVD, so we went home and watched it. This film just took me back to the classic comedies I grew up with like Trading Places, The Great Outdoors and Planes, Trains and Automobiles. Steve Martin is always a great comedic actor who is a pleasure to watch, same with Dan Aykroyd. While this movie doesn't stand out as well as their other films, this was still a lot of fun to watch.Master Sergeant Ernest G. Bilko is in charge of the motor pool at Fort Baxter, a small US Army base. Exploiting this position, he directs a number of scams ranging from gambling to renting out military vehicles. His commanding officer, Colonel Hall, overlooks Bilko's money making schemes, as he is more concerned with his own affairs. Bad news begins when inspector Major Thorn, Bilko's rival, arrives at the camp and begins to cast scrutiny on Bilko's record. The motivation for Thorn's actions is due to the intense rivalry between the two due to several mishaps in the past, particularly because Thorn's career was ruined due to one of Bilko's scams. Thorn's revenge ensues and ultimately it becomes a battle of wits between the two men. Thorn's reliance on sabotage ultimately leads to his downfall and he is sent to Greenland. Also Bilko's fiancée, Rita, whom Bilko has stood up several times at the altar. Bilko is given an ultimatum to win her back within 30 days or to lose her forever.I have to say that I did enjoy St. Bilko, it was great seeing this army crew just goof off and enjoying boot camp. I think my favorite scene was when Bilko has to prove that his crew are hard workers and could complete the obstacle course that the other army recruits could do. Just their reactions of course being as if they've never exercised before in their lives was a good laugh. Steve Martin and his fiancée constantly taking a trip up and down the aisle was fun too. Plus this has one of my favorite comedic actors, Phil Hartman, who is again a great watch is always guaranteed to give you a good laugh. While the film may not stand out, this was definitely worth the watch. I would recommend it if you need a good laugh, you're always in good company with Steve Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman, not to mention a baby Chris Rock.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 October 2009","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" You know what's weird?

How about push him into yet another formulaic thriller undercut by bad comedy and lousy female leads? A View To A Kill didn't kill 007, but it didn't miss by much.A common theme of many comments on this thread is that Roger Moore was too old at 57 to play James Bond. To be fair, Moore is in good physical shape, and could pass for a guy in his 40s. The problem this time is how emotionally disengaged he is from the story and the characters around him. For once he seems miserable at tossing off one of those token Moore-isms of his, like there's a fly in your soup when a contact of his is murdered by a poisoned butterfly.A self-conscious Roger Moore is not a good start for a Bond film, and it gets worse. The plot, something to do with a microchip maker's plan to destroy his competition by flooding Silicon Valley, gets out of hand early with a goofy horse-doping subplot that disappears an hour in. The direction by John Glen is ugly and uninspired, presenting an overall texture that strives to be both gritty and goofy and winds up a mess. Even John Barry's theme music sounds at times like a hollow On Her Majesty's Secret Service retread.Tanya Roberts and Grace Jones are fine physical specimens who can't act a lick between them. We're not sure about her is the first line about Jones' exotic May Day character, and after 22 years, I can't say I'm farther along than that. Roberts' Stacey Sutton screams and wears tight clothing, obviously not concerned for a moment about being mistaken for a serious actress.Christopher Walken unlocks the puzzle of how to succeed in such a bad movie by treating it as a total joke. His Max Zorin, the bad guy, is such a psychopath he kills his underlings for pure kicks and even tells the KGB where to get off. Walken wasn't known in the mid-'80s for his gonzo comedy stylings, so maybe this was a coming-out party for the cowbell side of his nature. Flip, smirking, he seems to enjoy himself whether he's winning or losing.May Day will provide you with a drink, he tells one unfortunate before his girl tosses him into the Pacific. Anyone else want to drop out?Most of the action setpieces are undercut by bad comedy, like an unfortunate fistfight in a factory where assailants are dumped on conveyor lines and turned into boxes. A fight in Stacey's house does manage to amuse and capture some of the old Bond spirit, and the finale on a blimp atop the Golden Gate Bridge is actually rather terrific.Patrick Macnee is even on hand as a 007 helper, alas not long enough. The problem though is more about overstaying one's welcome. Moore looks bored and jaded, while Lois Maxwell's Moneypenny, in her 14th and last Bond film, appears more matronly than ever dressed in an Easter bonnet to see Zorin at the Ascot horse races. Always good when MI6 has the secretaries helping with the field work.There are fun moments amid the stupidity and chaos of View To A Kill. It's not as terrible as Die Another Day, anyway.

Bogart as Blaine (or Blaine as Bogart) is so-ugly-yet-so-noble-he's-more-charming-than-prince-charming. And if you looked up the source of this equation.. then you've just found it!I came here for the water.. !This is a dialog to be taught, with so serene comedy; it comes in certain places to lighten smartly the hard atmosphere. I adore many clever lines and strangely I don't get board despite how many times I rehear them I'm shocked, shocked to find that there was gambling in here\/ Your winnings sir \/ Thank you very much !. Play itIt got one perfect music score. And the song, ohh; with the warm voice of (Dooley Wilson) it sums up the story of every movie and rather every life Well, it's still the same old story. A fight for love and glory. A case of do or die. The world will always welcome lovers as time goes by.Here's looking at you kidI adore the He just a lucky guy situation & double-meaning remark. I know that my tears go while the last 10 minutes, not because the lead leaves his love NO, but because the rebirth of heroism inside him, and the pretty solidness at portraying that cinematically in such immortal thrilling moments. Plus the last shot, in which Rick and Renault walk among the stars, this is one of the best endings ever.A lot of water under the bridgeMy friends used to hate me for talking about it non-stop (though, surprisingly, they loved it when saw it). It got me not seeing movies for nearly 8 months after I first watched it according to hypnotizing feel it caused and one real stunned question it gave  Is there any movie better than this ?!! I hated only (Paul Henreid)'s dryness, the fact that Bogart was shorter than Bergman so they had to hide that all the time, and the way anyone looks at this as ordinary movie. If only every movie tried to have something from it.Does it have a wild finish?Though I've loved a lot, but I think I've never loved a movie like I loved Casablanca. It makes the dream so true.

For those who didn't like it, well it is a movie. It is an effort to replicate the happenings of a long time ago when neither of us was around. Luckily, we do have a few directors who try to get real at such things &#x96; they try; some succeed, some make a fool of themselves and some go beyond what the people of then could understand and depict a story they feel is true, complete and powerful enough to support reason.SPR is a beautiful movie. Yes, it does get a little slow and I did feel that Steven did try forcing out emotions a little in some scenes but that's me &#x96; I hate any person who portrays army generals or commanders- I can never understand why do they have to be the wisest of the lot. I'd prefer a more humane leader &#x96; some who'd be conflicted, guilty and in the spur of the moment resolve to send in a team, maybe of expendable soldiers to bring out a last son.So leaving the movie aside, I'd comment on the technicalities. Sound &#x96; brilliant. I was way too small when this movie hit the theatres so I saw it at home on my Philips Dolby Surround and it hit me boom, bang & centre. It was piercing, jarring, ambient and well placed. As for the music, John Williams could've done better &#x96; it sounded very expected war hero symphony &#x96; So far I've not quite found a soundtrack that could outmatch James Horner in Apocalypto; if you find one&#x85;let me know.Cinematography is beautiful. I've not seen a movie look like this. Very well set up and the reduced tones help bring out the sunlight and the serenity. You can see destruction and beauty side by side. The color disappears when it rain, appears in the mornings, the nights are darker so that distant firing can be made out. In all it was very well taught of.Direction, well I am not going to criticize the man who made Schindler's and Jaws. Steven is the God of film making and he knows it. He has shown it. He moves with the camera, talks through his actors and is super fast at execution &#x96; you can feel the spontaneous takes in every scene. Still far from being Kubrick but I doubt there'd be anyone greater.P.S Please do not make another Indiana Jones movie. You totally are spoiling what you've earned you know. That goes from me, Stan, Kyle & Eric.My vote for SPR &#x96; 8 \/ 10.
