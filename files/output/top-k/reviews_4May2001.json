The whole robbery turns to a carnage when the police tries to stop the criminals.  Doesn't that sound familiar?  Maybe.  It's pretty much like Reservoir Dogs, isn't it?  Well, Roger Avary, who directed this film, also contributed for the writing of the scenarios of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.  Unfortunately, the Tarantino touch isn't there, so humor is absent in this film, and the characters are not fully developped.
