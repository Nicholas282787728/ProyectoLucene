They have heroes, explosions, foreign villains, amazing gunfights and pretty much all you need to have fun. But there is one type of action movie that we love the most, the so- called buddy films. They got almost what every action flick has (all mentioned above). But there is one major difference. In this type of movie, instead of one hero, you get two. Generally they are both partner cops and struggle to solve a major case involving drug-dealers. And Richard Donner's 1987's 'Lethal Weapon' is the movie that practically created this buddy movie genre, and it's still copied nowadays. But what makes 'Lethal Weapon' so special? We shall see. 'Lethal Weapons' story centers around its two major characters Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), both cops who are partnered to solve a case involving a gang of drug smugglers. Although the story may seem a bit cliché nowadays, that is because it was copied so many times - back then, it was fresh and new. But the main force that makes Shane Black's script so great is the depth of his two main characters and their relationship. They are so different that it's hard to understand how they get along so well. Riggs is a self-destruct, and almost suicidal cop, and that makes him the Lethal Weapon referred to on the title. Murtaugh, on the other hand, is just a simple detective, a family man who served in Vietnam and has been on the force for nearly 20 years. And it's this difference of opinion and style that makes the movie as good as it is - it's practically a love story between two thought guys in the middle of chases, gunfights, explosions. The dialog here is also marvelous - you sure are going to remember most of the main quotes. There are also a few funny lines and sequences to light up the mood a little bit.As stated, 'Lethal Weapon''s script revolves around Gibson and Glover. Therefore, the story simply wouldn't work without good acting of the pair. But thankfully, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover have so much chemistry on screen that you end up believing they are Riggs and Murtaugh on skin and flesh. They both deliver excellent performances, and, in my opinion, even Oscar-worthy ones, Specially for Gibson. The scene where Riggs almost kills himself in his apartment is quite an impressive achievement for Gibson, being the best scene on his career. And Glover also manages to deliver a very good performance. But apart from the main duo, there isn't really a lot to add on what refers to acting. No one from the supporting cast did a above-average job, but they really didn't need to. Gibson and Glover sure can hold the bar on their own.Another point that impressed me upon watching 'Lethal Weapon' was Richard Donner's directing. I've watched most of his other flicks, and I believe this is the best job he did since 'Superman'. He managed to always keep the pace of the flick, never let the bar go or anything. And also he did a incredible job filming the action scenes. The helicopter scene, to give the best example, is quite breath-taking, so is the chase at the end of the movie. And talking about the end - both the ending and the initial scenes are shockingly well-filmed. Technically, I can't also find many flaws in 'Lethal Weapon' - Stephen Goldblatt's cinematography works very well, so does the editing by Stuart Baird. If you're wandering if the musical score is good or not, there is only one thing to be said Eric Clapton did it (along with Michael Kamen).What can I say? 'Lethal Weapon' is the movie that started it all - it started the buddy film genre and introduced us to Roger Murtaugh and Martin Riggs, characters we all know and love. The movie's script is awesome, and it's still copied nowadays. Richard Donner's directing is also great, but what makes it almost perfect is the chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. Donner, Gibson, and Glover would still come back for three other sequels, but nothing can come close to the magic that was the first movie.

The two marry, but are forced to flee Austria when the Nazis invade in 1938. It is, very loosely, based on the story of the real Von Trapp family, although it takes many liberties with historical fact. In reality, Georg and Maria von Trapp fell in love in the twenties, not the thirties, were married in 1927 and had two children of their own by 1938. Maria was actually heavily pregnant at the time of her wedding, something tactfully omitted from the film. The family actually left Austria for America before, not after, the Anschluss. The film also differs somewhat, both in its plot line and its music, from the original Rodgers and Hammerstein stage musical; when I first saw it in the theatre I was surprised to hear unfamiliar songs which do not feature in the film. One song, Something Good, which was specially written for the film is now normally sung in stage productions, even though it was not included in the original.This was the Big Film of 1965 and the winner of five Academy Awards including Best Picture. It was a great box-office success, and is sometimes credited with saving 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy after their huge losses on Cleopatra. Nevertheless, it has a rather curious reputation today. It has not (unlike some films which were regarded as Big Films in their day) sunk into obscurity, but neither is it universally regarded as a beloved classic. There are of course some, especially among the older generation, who do think of it in that way, but for many it has taken on the status of a slightly naff guilty pleasure, something enjoyable if taken with a large pinch of irony. There is one cinema in London which hosts regular Sound of Music singalongs, with the audience encouraged to join in the songs and to dress up as nuns or Nazis. (I understand that on these occasions it is usual for the men to dress as Nazis and the women as nuns, although the opposite arrangement is by no means unknown).Certainly, this was a film I hated in my youth. I was first taken to see it as a child- it was the first film I ever saw in the cinema apart from a few Disney cartoons- and I didn't really understand what was going on. In my teenage years in the seventies and eighties it seemed to be on television ever Christmas, Easter and Bank Holiday, and I seemed to have to sit though every screening. (It was one of my mother's favourite films). In common with a lot of contemporaries I came to think of it as corny, sentimental and terminally uncool- a view shared by quite a few critics. Pauline Kael was allegedly dismissed from her job with McCall's magazine after writing a scathing review of it, and even its director Robert Wise originally described the story as too saccharine. (He changed his mind after the director originally hired, William Wyler, dropped out). When in the mid-nineties the BBC included it in a season of The 100 Greatest Films of All Time one critic sneered that it did not even count as one of The 100 Greatest Musicals Set in Austria.Despite (or perhaps because of) that sneer I decided to watch that screening, and realised that the film was much better than I had previously given it credit for, an impression strengthened when I recently saw it again for the first time in about fifteen years. Of course, it does have its faults. Some of the songs- My Favourite Things in particular- really are too sentimental for words, and the film's schematic morality is a bit too black-and-white to be artistically satisfying. In the white corner you have nuns, cute children, true love and the power of music. In the black corner you have the Nazis. Not much room for a grey area there.Yet the film also has its virtues. The photography, of the magnificent Alpine scenery and of the architecture of Salzburg, is particularly fine. Richard Rodgers wrote some of his best music for the original stage-show, including songs like Edelweiss, Climb Ev'ry Mountain, and the title song, and the performers, especially Julie Andrews, do it full justice here. Andrews makes a likable heroine, combining musical ability with tenderness, practicality and religious faith. Christopher Plummer's Captain, however, is perhaps a bit too strict and authoritarian in the early scenes for his later transition into romantic hero to be altogether convincing, and he is too young for the part, appearing not only to have become a father while still in his teens but also to have served in the Austrian navy as a ten-year-old. I wouldn't rate the film quite as highly as Wise's other famous musical, West Side Story, but then that is in my opinion, one of the greatest musicals ever.

The photography, of the magnificent Alpine scenery and of the architecture of Salzburg, is particularly fine. Richard Rodgers wrote some of his best music for the original stage-show, including songs like Edelweiss, Climb Ev'ry Mountain, and the title song, and the performers, especially Julie Andrews, do it full justice here. Andrews makes a likable heroine, combining musical ability with tenderness, practicality and religious faith. Christopher Plummer's Captain, however, is perhaps a bit too strict and authoritarian in the early scenes for his later transition into romantic hero to be altogether convincing, and he is too young for the part, appearing not only to have become a father while still in his teens but also to have served in the Austrian navy as a ten-year-old. I wouldn't rate the film quite as highly as Wise's other famous musical, West Side Story, but then that is in my opinion, one of the greatest musicals ever. Despite the disdain in which it is held in some quarters, and the rather patronising post-modern irony with which it is regarded in others, The Sound of Music is a well-crafted, if now rather old-fashioned, piece of family entertainment. 8\/10 ","genre":"Biography, Drama, Family"},{"date":"18 December 2010","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I remember seeing the trailer for this and thinking Wow, what a brilliant film it's going to be!!

This first installment in the franchise came out years before I was born, but I never saw it or even heard of it in my childhood. For at least the past few years, I've known about Reeve and his renowned portrayal of Superman, and the actor's sad fate which followed, but still didn't watch any of these films for some reason, even though I've seen many comic book movies in recent years. However, now that I've seen this first one, I can say that I am overall impressed, even if I don't rate it as highly as many others do.On the planet Krypton, Jor-El is a scientist who believes that the planet will explode in thirty days or less, but he cannot convince the ruling council of this. He decides to save his infant son, Kal-El, by sending him to Earth, where he will have superpowers due to his dense molecular structure. The scientist manages send his son away just as Krypton begins to destruct! In his small spacecraft, Kal-El lands in a rural American area, where he is found by Jonathan and Martha Kent. He becomes Clark Kent, and is raised by Jonathan and Martha on their farm in Smallville. Eighteen years later, Jonathan dies, and Kal-El\/Clark hears a call and finds the green crystal which was sent from Krypton to Earth with him. After this, he decides it is time for him to leave, so he goes to the Arctic, where the crystal creates a Fortress of Solitude for him. He sees a vision of his father, who educates him for the next twelve years. Kal-El then goes to the city of Metropolis, where he lives with two different identities. He is Clark Kent, a reporter for the Daily Planet newspaper, but is also Superman, a caped wonder who uses his superhuman abilities to fight crime and stop disasters! However, it will be harder for him to try and defeat a certain criminal named Lex Luthor! At the beginning, we hear a kid reading a comic book, and this part seemed a little awkward to me. This is followed by the opening credits sequence, with very impressive effects making it look like the credits are shooting through space, though this does get tiring. Next, we are shown the planet Krypton shortly before its destruction, and this part is made memorable by such aspects as the visuals and Marlon Brando's portrayal of Jor-El. Listening to three criminals screaming as they float away is a little irritating, but fortunately, we don't have to hear them for long. After Clark Kent grows up on Earth, the story becomes very effective as we see him face the death of his adoptive father, and then discover the crystal and leave for the Arctic. The Arctic scenes are very pleasing to the eye, and the formation of the Fortress of Solitude is an example of the film's great special effects. The entertainment continues as we are shown Clark Kent\/Superman's life in Metropolis. Christopher Reeve's portrayal of the protagonist isn't amazing, but he does have his charm and comical effect. The part where we hear Lois Lane's thoughts as she flies with Superman is a cheesy moment, but this is just one weak part, in amongst so many strong ones! There's lots of action and suspense to carry this comic book adaptation, and the movie can certainly be a visual treat, with its special effects and beautiful shots of the filming locations.Over thirty years have passed since this live action film version of Superman was introduced, starting a franchise featuring several more installments. It seems many who have seen this first installment in the franchise in the time since its release think of it as a masterpiece, and I can't say I'm one of them, but I still think this is one of the entertaining comic book movies I've seen over the years.

I think you might enjoy it. In it, Paul Newman plays the epitome of rebellious and non conformist, Luke. Luke is serving two years in a rural prison on a chain gang and he absolutely refuses to conform to the prison way of life. The other prisoners admire him for his gustiness and his smooth coolness, hence the title of the film, and the audience admires him in much the same way. At least I did. He has got a lot of spirit, attitude, and life in him to make him an extremely likable screen character. It also helps that he is Paul Newman.This film is an excellent insight into chain gang life. It conveys a perfect mixture of laid back ease as the prisoners go about their day to day work. There are a lot of fun moments that give the film a very cool and easy going feel, but then other moments appear out of nowhere that change the tone of the film instantaneously. Reality bites back hard in this when just as things start to look up, the harsh reality that this is still prison life comes down hard on Luke and his friends. Luke tries multiple times to escape and every time he is caught and brought back to the prison. There, the prison staff have no choice but to break his spirit any way they can so he won't try to escape again. This is where the film becomes its harshest, but also its most compelling. The film flows very nicely and is a slow crescendo to the riveting end.Perhaps one of the best things about Cool Hand Luke is its great effect as a character study. Paul Newman plays Luke extremely well and keeps him a steady hero to the audience as we root for him during anything he does. But what is also very interesting about his character is the relationships he builds with the other prisoners and how they morph and change throughout the film. George Kennedy plays Dragline, a fast talking rough and tough prisoner who Luke grows closest to. Their relationship is very compelling and developed incredibly well. Dragline, along with the rest of the prisoners, idolize Luke for his spirit and determination to escape, and seeing how this admiration develops on both sides of the equation is very interesting. As Luke grows more and more discouraged his adherence to the admiration dwindles until he is tired of it, making for some very interesting confrontations. The film is a very well rounded and interesting character study from start to finish.Cool Hand Luke is indeed a classic that will be remembered forever and revered as one of Paul Newman's finest roles. It is a very interesting look into chain gang life and the minds of those who work endlessly on the chain. It reflects a golden age of cinema and exemplifies what good filmmaking is all about.

The film is a very well rounded and interesting character study from start to finish.Cool Hand Luke is indeed a classic that will be remembered forever and revered as one of Paul Newman's finest roles. It is a very interesting look into chain gang life and the minds of those who work endlessly on the chain. It reflects a golden age of cinema and exemplifies what good filmmaking is all about. There's no BS here. Cool Hand Luke is a very well made film.

I really wanted to like this movie ....being a big fan of other seventies era flashback movies like American Graffiti, The Wanderers, etc. The quality of the film itself, and the sound, is lousy. The camera is often out of focus , and the dialog is unintelligible much of the time.They did manage to nail the greaser look pretty well, with the pegged jeans and pompadours , but the dialog shows little in the way of period correctness. Throw in a shmaltzy , bad soundtrack of meaningless 70s sounding pop ballads (which drown out the dialog,in many scenes),and any attempt to transport the viewer back to 1958 falls flat on it's face. The few lame attempts to throw a little Doo-Wop into the mix are just that  lame. The characters are universally shallow , and never do develop or capture the viewer. Unfortunate,because the film is rife with brooding silences which are supposed to be meaningful but are just plain awkward. We don't know these people, we don't FEEL these people, so the empathy and emotional hook we should feel during these dialog-free moments just isn't there.If you are looking for a plot , storyline, climax, or conclusion ....keep lookin', because this film has none of the above. So we have no compelling characters , no story , and bad music. Hmmm. One scene stands out to spotlight the mediocrity of this film  The Drive-In scene  Chico  What's wrong?(30 seconds of awkward silence)Jane  Nothing.(30 more seconds of awkward silence)Chico  What's wrong ?(30 more seconds of awkward silence)Jane  Nothing !(30 more seconds of awkward silence)I could hardly bear to watch.Really.

Johnny Depp was quite good in the role - one of the few straight roles that I've seen him in, as opposed to the quirky style of character he usually seems to play. Depp had to play his character in two different settings - one as Brasco, the young mobster seeking to work his way up through the mob, and then as FBI agent Joe Pistone, who finds his mob life overtaking his personal life, to the point at which his marriage and family almost break apart under the strain. It was a fine piece of work by Depp, showing the character becoming almost overtaken by his mob persona, and steadily rising within the family to a level not even the FBI expected.Al Pacino was the perfect partner for Depp in this. I don't think anyone could play the role of Lefty - a middle management mob type as well as Pacino. Lefty is a frustrated mobster, unable to advance in spite of many years of service, who recruits Brasco and then finds himself overtaken by the young newcomer to the family. Pacino was completely believable in the role, as you would expect from such an accomplished actor. Depp and Pacino were teamed with a pretty solid supporting cast, the most notable of them being probably Anne Heche as Joe's long- suffering wife Maggie.The biggest weakness in this was probably some poor pacing and structure in the first hour or so. It didn't seem to be fitting together all that well, and it actually seemed to start too abruptly, with Lefty trying to sell Brasco a diamond. How did Brasco get into that position in the first place? I wondered that all the way through. How did his undercover work begin?

It has no connection with the Al Pacino\/Michelle Pfeiffer film of the same name from 1991, but is instead fairly loosely based upon the well-known American folk-song. It is set some time in the late nineteenth century, probably around 1880 or 1890, although the exact date is never stated. Johnny and his girlfriend Frankie are performers on a Mississippi riverboat; Johnny is also a compulsive gambler, and as the boat has a casino on board he has plenty of opportunities to gamble. The film deals with the complications caused in their relationship by Johnny's gambling habit and Frankie's jealousy of his friendship with an attractive redhead named Nellie Bly. Johnny's interest in Nellie arises from the fact that a gypsy fortune-teller has informed him that a red-haired woman will bring him luck, but the jealous Frankie suspects that their relationship goes much deeper.One of the problems of casting a rock star in a Victorian period drama is that rock didn't actually exist in the Victorian era. The makers of this film are not really all that concerned with period accuracy- some of the music we hear sounds suspiciously like jazz, which didn't really exist in the 1880s, and even the song Frankie and Johnny itself was not published in its modern form until the 1920s. Somebody, however, obviously realised that rock-and-roll would be anachronistic, so the star gets to sing a series of bland, totally forgettable easy-listening numbers.Elvis was always fairly laid-back as an actor, but in this film he doesn't seem to make much effort as a singer either, being content just to stroll his way through the film. The rest of the cast are no better; in his film career Elvis played opposite some pretty obscure leading ladies, but Donna Douglas is one of the least memorable of the bunch. I was not surprised to discover that this was the last film she made in a brief cinema career. About the complicated and often far-fetched plot, the less said the better. Most Elvis Presley films these days are unlikely to appeal to anyone other than his many devoted admirers, but I suspect that even they will find themselves feeling a bit short-changed by this one. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"18 December 2010","score":"4 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" Frankie and Johnny is one in the long line of musicals which Elvis Presley churned out in the sixties.

The film deals with the complications caused in their relationship by Johnny's gambling habit and Frankie's jealousy of his friendship with an attractive redhead named Nellie Bly. Johnny's interest in Nellie arises from the fact that a gypsy fortune-teller has informed him that a red-haired woman will bring him luck, but the jealous Frankie suspects that their relationship goes much deeper.One of the problems of casting a rock star in a Victorian period drama is that rock didn't actually exist in the Victorian era. The makers of this film are not really all that concerned with period accuracy- some of the music we hear sounds suspiciously like jazz, which didn't really exist in the 1880s, and even the song Frankie and Johnny itself was not published in its modern form until the 1920s. Somebody, however, obviously realised that rock-and-roll would be anachronistic, so the star gets to sing a series of bland, totally forgettable easy-listening numbers.Elvis was always fairly laid-back as an actor, but in this film he doesn't seem to make much effort as a singer either, being content just to stroll his way through the film. The rest of the cast are no better; in his film career Elvis played opposite some pretty obscure leading ladies, but Donna Douglas is one of the least memorable of the bunch. I was not surprised to discover that this was the last film she made in a brief cinema career. About the complicated and often far-fetched plot, the less said the better. Most Elvis Presley films these days are unlikely to appeal to anyone other than his many devoted admirers, but I suspect that even they will find themselves feeling a bit short-changed by this one. 4\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance"},{"date":"18 December 2010","score":"4 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" Frankie and Johnny is one in the long line of musicals which Elvis Presley churned out in the sixties. It has no connection with the Al Pacino\/Michelle Pfeiffer film of the same name from 1991, but is instead fairly loosely based upon the well-known American folk-song.

However the other characters deaths have nothing to do with ghosts, and when they do, it is really boring. The characters were really fake. The characters were not well developed.

Of course, the film is quite playful and joyous at times. It's one of those feel good films that come around once in a while. Well, this film has a great cast. I loved Isabelle Nanty who plays hypochondriac tobacconist Georgette. She's a brilliant actress herself comically. This comedic, light-hearted and serious film at times is quite enjoyable to watch. I love the Parisian sites like Sacre Couer and Montmartre as well. Amelie tries to make lives better for those around her around the time of Princess Diana's tragic death. She wants and she dreams about being appreciated for all those good things. Amelie's childhood wasn't a happy one. She didn't have playmates. Her mother died tragically and her father the doctor was cold and distant. She works as a waitress in a bar\/restaurant in Paris. She visits her father on Sundays. For the most part, Amelie is a lonely character until she herself falls for somebody.

In a lot of cases these films are not that good, just simply have a special appeal to generate a cult following. But in the case of a special few like 'Millers Crossing' or 'Glengarry Glen Ross', these movies are truly amongst the leaders and very best in their field, to the point that as soon as the credits roll, you wonder how the hell you've never watched this before or why it didn't make greater box office or claim any major awards.The Way of the Gun is like the bastard child of a Western and a Gangster flick, holding many of the attributes of both genres and belonging to neither in whole. It centres around two wayfaring career-criminals who stumble into a kidnapping that leads to a great deal more than they bargained for. Every character in this film has game, everyone brings something motivated to the table with a twisted angle or a revelation. This movie oozes cool in almost every scene with Benicio Del Toro leading that emphasis with inspired panache! Ryan Phillippe has never performed this well again and both James Caan and Taye Diggs excel in their roles. If writer-director Christopher McQuarrie ever blesses us with another specimen presented as brilliantly as this then we should consider ourselves truly fortunate.If ever a movie was worthy of 10 stars, it's this one. Everything from the well paced, unfolding plot and the riveting chess-like gun-play to the awesome musical score that hits the nail on the head like Elmer Burnstein's Magnificent Seven or John Williams's Superman theme. A hidden gem that's well worth discovering for the first time as much as it is revisiting, superb!
