It was a movie with a lot of very good actors in it, particularly Angelina Jolie, Ed Burns, and Tony Shaloub. However, in the end, it wasn't as original as it could have been, and its message is far from unique. If I had a nickel for every time a movie used the hackneyed phrase, Live life to its fullest, I would probably never have to shell out my last ten dollars to see a movie at the movie theater again. For those reasons, the movie was really just okay to me; not great.Angelina Jolie stars as Lanie Kerrigan, a young ambitious TV reporter who is already well-recognized and credible in her local Seattle network affiliate. Her ambition is to be a reporter on the Today Show-like network morning news show AM USA. When she gets the opportunity to audition for the show, a street psychic (the great Tony Shaloub) prophesizes her death effective seven days from the day she asked.Admittedly, it is nice to see Jolie in a role that doesn't involve her being a tough-as-nails action hero or a sex kitten. Also, she had some good parts in this movie that were a bit heartfelt, such as when she reflects on her rebellious childhood, or reconnects with her blue-collar father. However, as good an actress as Jolie truly is, my guess is that she must not have done much research for her role. Why? Because she is completely unconvincing as a TV reporter. When asking questions (particularly in her last interview), she practically whispered her questions, which is something TV reporters (at least good ones) should not and do not do. Jolie probably should have studied Katie Couric or Meredith Viera, and she wouldn't even have to leave her trailer to do it either.Her romance with Ed Burns' character was also really hokey, not to mention predictable. He's a good looking guy, and they fight constantly in the beginning of the movie. Such a setup is so overdone (even dating as far back as Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing) and so unoriginal that I was not surprised at all when their romantic scene came up. It surprised me too, because Burns is not only one of the more likable lead actors in the history of romantic comedies, but he has also starred in, written, and directed some of the most original romantic comedies ever (The Brothers McMullan, She's The One). Burns is still likable in his role, but this romantic subplot is so cliché that it really ruins the film.The plot involving Jolie trying to deny or avoid death was also completely unbelievable, particularly towards the end. First, without ruining anything, Jolie's character realization of her fate in the very end seemed a bit contrived given her circumstances. Second, I didn't really get involved with her character enough to care if she died in the end. I guess the character wasn't developed enough, or the plot was too flimsy and archaic. I can't decide which.This movie was certainly not terrible, and it had its moments. For the most part, though, there were too many scenes in this movie that went beyond the laws of common sense that it was just too unbelievable. Other scenes, if not unbelievable, were just too predictable. If the movie had decided to just be a movie about a successful woman's pre-midlife crisis based on false prophecy, and not a romantic comedy in Deep Thoughts clothing, it probably would have gone on to more accolades. Instead, it's just marginally good. I can't give it a stronger recommendation than that.

I wasn't absolutely blown away by it, nor was I expecting to be, but I was expecting it to be better than its 1997 remake, with more laughs, and I think my moderate expectations were basically met.Ned Brainard is an absent-minded physical chemistry professor at Medfield College. On the day of the third wedding attempt (the professor failed to show up the first two times), Betsy Carlisle, his fiancée, waits for him, hoping he will show up this time. Unfortunately, he gets carried away with his experiments, trying to uncover the mysteries of the universe, and despite how hard his housekeeper tries to remind him about his wedding, she does not succeed. However, he does discover a powerful new substance, which he calls Flubber! Every time this substance hits a hard surface, it gains energy! He attempts to bring attention to this new discovery of his, but his efforts prove unsuccessful, as people are generally skeptical. It only seems to catch the attention of Alonzo P. Hawk, a scheming businessman who threatens the future of the college, and plans to use Flubber for his personal gain! For me, The AbsentMinded Professor was far from consistently hilarious, but there were definitely times when I laughed, even if the laughs were usually light. When I wasn't laughing, I think I was often smiling. A couple explosions early in the film, plus the main character playing tricks with his flying Model-T, getting his foe in trouble with the police one night, and some of the other things done with the Flubber, to be good comical moments, some more than others.

However, it's probably still entertaining for many different age groups today, though maybe just to a lesser degree than before. Flubber obviously has more modern aspects than The AbsentMinded Professor, but had potential to be so much better than it turned out to be, especially with Robin Williams in the lead role, and its predecessor remains superior.

And in this case, I wasn't all that thrilled after reading it. Don't get me wrong, it's a great book. Whitley has a clever writing-style. He fights a constant psychological battle, on the one hand coming up with evidence that he really was abducted by aliens, while otherwise trying to refute the experience with other, more rational explanations. He also, at times, delves into folklore and mythology, though he only scratches the tip of the iceberg and doesn't really develop nor support any theories. This book's really about him and his experience. Makes up for an interesting read, but the downside is, that the book becomes very repetitive after a while. Strieber keeps on going over the same events that happened on two nights in such a way that after a while he really isn't adding anything new. Not a new angle, nor a new light on the matter.

His relatively straight-forward to film have created a sort of Arnold Formula. From being a barbarian warrior to an evil robot assassin from the future all the way to playing a Soviet Police Officer and then a good robot protector from the future all the while fighting a variety of enemies Schwarzenegger's movie have not always been good, but he sure does have a taste for variety. That's probably what has kept him making big movies while other action stars have faded out by playing the same role over and over again. Here Schwarzenegger fights what just might be his toughest opponent Satan, the devil himself!However, that is also where some potential problems begin to arise. For one Arnold, in his best movies, was an action hero with a smile on his face. The exception to that being the Terminator movies. End of Days is much more dark than your typical Arnold movie, but then again that might be appropriate since he fighting the prince of Darkness. Though, this dark edge is largely confined to bloody violence and menacing explosions. Any sort of dark horror atmosphere or a really scary film about one of the stories of ultimate evil surfacing on Earth are put second. But does that matter? Not really. Schwarzenegger has been serving up mayhem since the 70s and he continues to do here in decent form.

There isn't one scene that doesn't move me. It is also underrated, as it is very difficult to find, and is hardly on TV. The cinematography was beautiful, and the subject matter about a doctor treating a heavily-disfigured man is so sensitively handled I felt I was there. One of the most moving scenes, was right at the beginning when Treves sees Merrick for the first time, and a tear rolls down his cheek.Extraordinary! The scene with Treve's wife is so sad that I had tears in my eyes for the rest of the movie. When he cries, I am not an animal, I am a human being, I was actually sobbing. i really was. The ending, with the lovely Adagio for Strings(the only time it has been played well) was so poignant, as was the scene in the theatre, with the Tchaikovsky-like music, and Merrick enjoying himself like a 6 year old boy. The music is very haunting, as made apparent in the crowd scene mocking Merrick in the hospital. Don't criticise the beginning, or the end, because David Lynch was trying to create images of pure sadness and inner beauty, and they were very powerful images. As for the performances, never have I seen Anthony Hopkins more sensitive than he was here(well except for the final scene of Shadowlands). His performance was actually one of the main reasons why this movie is so beautiful. The best performance, without a doubt, is the heart-rending performance of John Hurt as John Merrick. Almost unrecognisable, but so magnificent, especially when he recited the psalm without the help of Treves. It is also incredibly difficult to speak with a lopsided mouth, and John Hurt mastered it. Other notable performances are from Freddie Jones, Anne Bancroft, Michael Elphick and Sir John Gielgud. Anyone who gave this a 1\/10, what is wrong with you?

Perhaps because of this, the young and naive Hitchcock appears to be cramming in as much visual technique as possible.Right from his first picture, Hitchcock had loved the point-of-view shot. Champagne makes heavy use of what I call extreme point-of-view shots &#150; that is, ones which really draw your attention to the fact that we are seeing a character's-eye-view, for example where we see the actor's hands in front of us, or the camera moves as the character walks. To this end Hitchcock even had giant props built to wave in front of the lens. There are also copious other techniques which aim to literalise the experience of the characters &#150; for example shaking the camera around when the ship is rocking. Although the later Hitchcock would sometimes use such tricks (far more subtly) to draw the audience into the character's world, here and now it's just a bit of overt stylisation that in no way enhances the film.Trickery for trickery's sake is often worse than useless. When Betty Balfour is told her father has lost his fortune, there is a superimposition of a room spinning. If Balfour is good enough, she could convey what is going on inside her character's head. I think I speak for most audience members when I say I would rather look at a good acting performance than a post-production special effect.It's a pity Hitch felt he needed to dress up his shots so much, because even at this early stage he had good timing for basic point-of-view and reaction shots, allowing him to smoothly reveal intentions and opinions. His basic film grammar is good enough to keep down the number of intertitles. By the way, the difference between a picture like this and those made around the same time in the US (which tend to be very wordy) is not that the Hollywood directors were bad at visual storytelling, it's that their pictures were often full of unnecessary title cards, whereas in Europe the goal was generally to keep them to a minimum.It's a mercy too that the acting in Champagne tends to be fairly naturalistic, the only touches of theatricality being for the sake of comedy. None of them is exceptional, but none of them is really bad either. I'm not quite convinced though by Gordon Harker as a millionaire, but perhaps this is because I'm so used to seeing him playing earthy working class types.All else I have to say about Champagne is that it is just a bit dull &#150; a comedy drama that is not enough of one thing or the other. A reasonable plot, a handful of good gags, but ultimately lifeless. At this point Hitchcock was really just saying, through his camera, Look at me! I'm the director!

Notably, The Sixth Sense had one quite terrifying scene, but contained nothing else that was truly scary. It's so hard to find an amazing horror title today that I've almost given up trying. Rosemary's Baby (1968) is not only a film that (no joke here) cannot be watched alone, but is the scariest, most horrifying film of all time.It's difficult to break it all down, because there is so much that contributes to the sheer fear this movie gives off. Firstly, Roman Polanski directs with some magic here, conjuring a well-written script into a haunting visual masterpiece. It is creepy how this film is so real, how the idea within its story doesn't seem very fictional. Mia Farrow plays Rosemary with frightening, twisted emotion. Her character even seems a little eerie at times when she begins to go too far with her accusations, and speaks as if somebody tortured her. John Cassavetes is unpredictable, and his character unreadable. He gives a solid performance, and Ruth Gordon, in her Oscar-winning portrayal of Minnie Castevet, brings the only light to this film, brewing a mix of nosiness and hilarity to her character.I've found that films about Satanists are the very scariest, including this one and Dario Argento's Suspiria (1977). The film is shot smartly, and in a way that keeps the mystery, fear, and suspense tingling right to the very end. Again, Polanski is very masterful and careful about how he works this film, and how he directs his actors. If I had to pick the main reasons why this movie is so scary, and why it makes my hairs stick up so tall, it would have to be the camera work and directing, the story and script and how brilliantly it's played out, the simple feel and atmosphere, so unpredictable and creepy, the acting, done with malice and originality that I am still afraid to think about, and finally, the music.Krzysztof Komeda composes the most haunting, and definitive horror film score, a lullaby that produces goosebumps and that gets the mind racing through tunnels of fear, through darkness, acting as almost a prelude to what is to happen in the film. It would even be plausible to say that the wild, satanic flute music, and mainly the original score, account for almost all of the film's alarming mountain of horror.Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is a unique horror film, one that is immensely scary, and also very well made. Never again will there be a better film of its kind. Polanski creates an air of dooming, prevalent fear and musically and plot-driven terror, but the greatest thing he achieves is the surpassing of Hitchcock's greatest works, in the same style--playing his own game, and coming out on top.

Again, Polanski is very masterful and careful about how he works this film, and how he directs his actors. If I had to pick the main reasons why this movie is so scary, and why it makes my hairs stick up so tall, it would have to be the camera work and directing, the story and script and how brilliantly it's played out, the simple feel and atmosphere, so unpredictable and creepy, the acting, done with malice and originality that I am still afraid to think about, and finally, the music.Krzysztof Komeda composes the most haunting, and definitive horror film score, a lullaby that produces goosebumps and that gets the mind racing through tunnels of fear, through darkness, acting as almost a prelude to what is to happen in the film. It would even be plausible to say that the wild, satanic flute music, and mainly the original score, account for almost all of the film's alarming mountain of horror.Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby is a unique horror film, one that is immensely scary, and also very well made. Never again will there be a better film of its kind. Polanski creates an air of dooming, prevalent fear and musically and plot-driven terror, but the greatest thing he achieves is the surpassing of Hitchcock's greatest works, in the same style--playing his own game, and coming out on top.

Plus, I think most modern films are heavy on the sex and foul language - and as a Christian, I find it offensive.So it is rare when Hollywood puts out not only a great film in terms of the quality of the story and the performances, but which also has very little language and no explicit sexual content (inspite of this being rated R but that is due to the violence).This movie did something that rarely happens with me in modern films in that it completely absorbed me into the time period, the location and the story. I felt somewhat transported for the entire length - which given its long running time, was quite a feat. It never once seemed to lag or get slow - but kept my complete attention. Not only that, but I have seen this film numerous times (probably at least 6 times) and it never fails to capture my complete attention - even though I know what is going to happen next. That is the sign of not only a great movie - but a MASTERPIECE in my opinion.Crowe's performance was amazing, but I'm a little surprised that he won, while Joaquin Phoenix was ROBBED. He was nominated, but lost to Benicio Del Torro for TRAFFIC. Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus was so completely engrossing - the creep factor was exponential. I think his is one of the all time great villainous portrayals - but in ways that at times were so subtle that it made him even more despicable.I only had one mild complaint of the film which is I felt the past history between Lucilla and Maximus was not completely explained and I think would have enriched the understanding of the 2 characters.I own very few DVD's but this is one that we did end up getting since it never fails to deliver a completely absorbing experience - time after time!

(I wanted to use the proper word, but modesty forbids).Nowhere is Hollywood's dilemma more exposed than in this film. Of course, one never talks about sex, especially between members of the aristocracy, let alone admit to its practise between consenting adults unless absolutely necessary.For me, the best bit of the film was the couple of minutes allocated to Berkeley and his Somalian woman who just happens to be serving tea in beautiful china cups when Redford shows up unexpectedly. She very quickly withdraws to a little corner in the adjoining room while the two men talk business, ignoring her as if she is not quite human, but attractive nonetheless.The choice of Mozart for the soundtrack is pure genius. No other composer could quite capture the atmosphere as Mozart, but are we to assume that the native Africans could not also have enjoyed his music as much as the white man? As one might expect, the film concentrated on the lives of the white folk, while the black population were simply subjugated to minor roles, and always in the capacity of servants and manual workers. Even the chief of the tribe was regarded as an inferior human being, although some respect was given to his position. This is a shameful indictment of British Colonialism.Berkeley is dying of black water fever. Later on, Redford tells Meryl.'Oh, I'd better go and visit him,' she replies.'Er, I don't think that would be a good idea,' exclaims Redford, 'he's got himself a woman, a Somalian.' 'Oh,' replies the Baroness, turning her nose up at the thought of such an unsavoury union.'She seems to be quite fond of him,' returns Redford by way of explanation.So why might Berkeley have been so drawn to her, we ask ourselves! Well, had the camera been spying on the pair of them in his last dying days, we would have seen the smile on his face occasioned by the fantastic blow jobs she was giving him.But then that would have been mixing fantasy with reality.

(I wanted to use the proper word, but modesty forbids).Nowhere is Hollywood's dilemma more exposed than in this film. Of course, one never talks about sex, especially between members of the aristocracy, let alone admit to its practise between consenting adults unless absolutely necessary.For me, the best bit of the film was the couple of minutes allocated to Berkeley and his Somalian woman who just happens to be serving tea in beautiful china cups when Redford shows up unexpectedly.

I didn't know of any other work of his till i recently came across 'Cry Freedom', released back in 1987. While it may not have been as popular as his Gandhi, it is every bit as gripping, if not more, and was released when South Africa still had not got rid of the shackles of apartheid. While most movies on social issues come out after the event had happened, i guess this one released during the time.The story is based on real life characters and events. The book on which the movie was based, was written by Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), a journalist who used to work in South Africa until the end of the seventies. It traces the origins of Woods friendship with the charismatic black leader Steve Biko, who is wonderfully portrayed by Denzel Washington. I cannot imagine a better choice for the role. Washington exudes a natural charm and screen presence, which Biko's character required.While initially, Woods was against what he felt was black racism being spread by Biko, after meeting the man, he could not help being drawn into his struggles and ideas. The bond between them grows stronger, and Woods and his family realise and become more sensitive to the plight of the people Biko represents.However, finally, tragedy strikes, and Woods must now concentrate on escaping from South Africa, with his book, so that he can get it published and let the outside world know what is going on. The second half of the movie is a gripping tale of his escape from South Africa, along with his family, and will keep you on tenterhooks.There are some deliciously humorous dialogues too. The scene between Biko and the lawyer in the courtroom is an example.Lawyer Do you advocate violence? Biko I advocate a confrontation. Lawyer Well, isn't that violence, Mr. Biko? Biko Not necessarily. You and I are having a confrontation now, but i don't see any violence.However, there are moments that bring you back to the horrors that pervaded the country before better sense prevailed. The scene where the army opens fire on a protest by school children is gut wrenching and heartbreaking.This is definitely a must watch. I would suggest those not familiar with Attenborough's work, do take time out for this. There are movies which make a lot of money. And there are movies which make lives. I would any day prefer the latter.

The beauty of the inhumane beast that is war is almost too painful to watch - the innocence and beauty of youth made scintillating by the utter inhuman annihilation of it... and that is just on one level of this masterful satire.Many critics point out that the message is not clear enough for a satire but if Verhoeven stooped to portraying this fascist society in an overtly negative light without any redeeming qualities then it would have become exactly a bland and unconvincing tool of propaganda that he so relentlessly attacks in this film. Many satires fall flat on their face because they present their subject in an overly negative light. What is most disturbing in ST is that we actually do root for the good guys and understand why this society became what it is... it makes us understand the lure of militarism on a visceral level and a lot of people used to black\/white thinking may find this unbearable. The movie is not trying to sell you its viewpoint or a message.. beneath its intentionally carnivalesque shoot-em-up exterior it is coldly analytical to the level of being painful - which explains the high incidence hysterical laughter i noticed in the audience reacting to its many over the top moments, both in terms of gore and story.Verhoeven at his very, very best.
