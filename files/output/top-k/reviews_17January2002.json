This is not the worst film you will ever see.  Not the best, but certainly not the worst.I think that the most derogatory thing that you can say about the movie is that it is derivative, but then again so are 95% of b-movies and that is exactly what this is - a big big b-movie.  Look at what you have.  A pumped up James Spader (very good actor) playing a role that would normally be filled by the likes of Jean Claude Van Damme; Angela Bassett (again, very good actor) as the hard as nails on the outside, soft on the inside doctor; a naked Robin Tunney (no complaints here!) and Lou Diamond Phillips (no complaints from my girlfriend!) and your standard computer whiz played by Wilson Cruz.  Add to that your shape shifting villain, an alien weapon, great special effects, etc. and you have a pretty interesting b-movie, nothing more, nothing less.Considering the fact that four directors worked on this (and no mention of Geoffrey Wright of Romper Stomper fame - shame on you IMDB!), I am surprised that it turned out as well as it did.  I am almost tempted to buy the region 2 DVD with it's promised 20 minutes of extra footage.  Is it worth watching?  Yeah, I think so.

The crash sets Godzilla free from the iceberg wherein he was caught seven years ago! Godzilla soon heads towards the coast of Hokkaido, where he is welcomed by Japanese army tanks and missiles. Meanwhile Mr. Tako, the hyper-nervous head of a pharmaceutical company, becomes obsessed with finding the legendary ape god King Kong who is said to be living on Pharoh Island in the Pacific ocean. He sends his men Sakurai and Furue to the island in order to bring King Kong to Japan to improve his company's publicity (??). After several trouble on the island, they manage to return, but King Kong escapes and soon arrives in mainland Japan, where Godzilla is heading south, enroute to Tokyo! The two meet, and in the following fight, Godzilla emerges as the winner. But then Kong regains his powers through electric energy and attacks Tokyo! The army manages to put Kong to sleep and bring him and Godzilla together again. The showdown between King Kong and Godzilla takes place near Mount Fuji.This is it - the battle between the two most famous movie monsters of all time. West against East; King Kong, the Eight Wonder of the World against Godzilla, the King of the monsters. One of the greatest monster film classics, it was released to celebrate the 30th anniversary of King Kong. It was the third film in the Showa Godzilla series and also the first Godzilla movie in color and Cinemascope (or Tohoscope, how Toho studios called that). And it was my very first Godzilla movie to see!  King Kong Vs Godzilla became the most successful Godzilla movie ever in Japan and the only one that was even more successful than the original eight years before. And it is the monster movie everybody has heard of, but it seems very few people actually saw it. And very, very few people outside Japan have ever seen this film in it's uncut, 97-minutes glory. Ishirô Honda was back at the helm, and Akira Ifukube composed one of his most impressive soundtracks ever. Typically, it was completely removed by the film's western distributors! Instead, we hear sound from Jack Arnold's Creature from the Black Lagoon and other stock music... Again, the film was cut and badly dubbed, and senseless, downright ridiculous new scenes were inserted - the results here are even more horrible than with the first Godzilla film. Unfortunately, this film also marks the point where Godzilla movies started to become (too) silly at times. But no movie is perfect, and this for shure is a must-own for EVERY science-fiction fan out there. In it's original version only, of course!
