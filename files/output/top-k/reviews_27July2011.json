One of the films that he highly recommended was The Monster Squad, the weird thing is being a huge movie buff, I had never heard of this movie. But it looked really cool from the clips he was showing, so I decided to just buy the movie and I am glad I did. One of the things I am a huge fan of is the old Universal horror movies, like Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Wolf Man, etc. But during the 80's it was more about making new horror icons like Jason and Freddy. Being brought back together in a clever updated way, we get to see all the icons together being led by Dracula. It's so odd because I don't know if this was a kid's movie, a family movie or a true horror film, I think the answer is yes. I wonder what kind of effect this movie would have had on me if I saw it as a child vs. an adult, but honestly I had an absolute wonderful time watching it in my 20's, and this is definitely a great film to watch during Halloween.The Monster Squad is a club of pre-teens who idolize classic monsters and monster movies and hold their meetings in a tree clubhouse. Sean is given the diary of legendary vampire hunter Van Helsing - but his excitement is toned down when he finds it's written in German. Sean, his best friend Patrick, and the rest of the Monster Squad get their neighbor who is German to translate the diary. The diary describes, in great detail, an amulet that is composed of concentrated good. One day out of every century, as the forces of good and evil reach a balance, the otherwise-indestructible amulet becomes vulnerable to destruction, and the next day of balance falls within a couple days, at the stroke of midnight. The kids realize they must gain possession of the amulet before the day of balance arrives; once they have the amulet, the kids can use it to open a hole in the universe and cast the monsters into Limbo. Dracula, meanwhile, seeks to obtain the amulet before the Monster Squad does, so that the Count can take control of the world.The kids are absolutely hilarious! Almost like seeing if The Goonies took on the old monsters, we have a whole different variety of the cliché kids. Plus they have one of the coolest lines in film history with Wolfman's got nards!, that was too priceless. Seeing Frankenstein and the little sister together was both charming and very funny to watch. I love that Frankenstein isn't the typical monster that he's normally made out to be since he is more of a tragic figure and he's a good guy in the film. I think why this film is so great is because of the chemistry between the kids and the rest of the cast. Plus I have to admit that I was a weird kid who absolutely adored horror movies and this just took me back. It could take us all back to a time where monsters were cool, even though I'm pretty sure we wouldn't want to defeat them in a battle, but they were fun to talk about and watch on the big screen. Remember Halloween? When it was about getting dressed up and getting candy and coming home and pigging out and watching a scary movie? The Monster Squad gave me the chance to be a kid again and I adore this movie, totally worth the buy.9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 July 2011","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" So a few months ago I was watching an internet reviewer who was talking about good Halloween movies to watch.

But for adults, the movie is strong enough that they seemingly overlook it.Back to the Future has many strengths, such as drawing you into the fantasy of what it would be like to travel back to the 1950s. There is enough detail and authenticity to the recreation that you are able to imagine you have gone back in time with the movie. I like movies that get young people interested in understanding what it was like before they were born. Yet, if you are going to go through all the trouble of recreating the 1950s, the time-travel fantasy effect would work better if the acting were more believable. On the other hand, they overdo the sin-city decay of the 1985 present, for a small American town\/city. There are some echoes of Bedford Falls without George Bailey, from It's a Wonderful Life (which would make a nice companion viewing). And speaking of connections, I believe this is the same town set used in Harvey with James Stewart, and for Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt (?).The bottom line is Back to the Future starts with a cute concept and gives it several layers of action and irony that keep you amused. It succeeds in the rare accomplishment for a comedy of working just about as effectively upon subsequent viewings. This is because the humor is not based on crude jokes or bad language, but on the manipulation of the tension in the awkward, off-balance relationships between the characters. Part of the genius of this film is the way these awkward relationships are resolved to the audience's immense satisfaction.These strengths are why I still enjoy this film, despite the over- acting.

Although not their best work by any means, Blood Simple. laid a foundation that proved beyond refute what the filmmakers would continue to build upon in their careers. Blood Simple. shows not only the continuity of their work, but also their devotion to particular brand of storytelling.As we've come to know them for, the Coens have spun a tale of ordinary people in un-ordinary (and difficult\/illegal) situations, flailing like fish out of water as some recurring symbolism might suggest. Wealthy bar owner Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya) hires a private investigator (M. Emmet Walsh), a cowboy to the gills plus a 10-gallon hat, to spy on his two-timing wife (Frances McDormand) and her current lover and Marty's employee, Ray (John Getz). Tired of feeling inadequate, Marty pays the investigator to off them, but things don't go quite as he suspects.A series of dominoes fall in which all of the main characters end up over their heads based on a disconnect between what they believe to have happened and the reality (that we the audience see firsthand).Other than McDormand, who would marry one of the brothers and become a staple in their films, the major difference between Blood Simple. and their prime work would be the acting. Walsh and Hedaya fit their roles well, but Getz, a rather critical character, can't seem to pull it off. He plays something between frightened and stupid. Fortunately we're so intrigued by what the consequences of his pivotal scenes will be that we're mostly distracted from thinking about how much better the film could've been if he could fit the bill. The Coens' films have always needed a combination of actors who can pull off ordinary people and those who can be a bit larger than life but in a controlled way. Walsh pulls off the latter as the private investigator and McDormand as the former, which makes the climax work quite well.Connecting the dots of the film can be difficult at times. The story lacks a sense of justice and authority (as simple as having a police detective in the script), which makes it impossible to predict the film's outcome in exciting fashion and blurs the lines between good and evil. Just as the Coens wanted, to be sure, but some residual effects seem to linger that makes the characters tough to understand in terms of motivations.

And Robert De Niro is among Hollywood's finest actors. Though both worked together in this film Once Upon A Time In America, it is awful. The idea of five childhood friends joining together to start an empire of crime is an interesting idea&#x97;which pulled me into viewing this nearly 4-hour feature. So, what makes this movie so bad? Mostly, it is the direction of how the story unfolds. The film's primary focus is on David Aaronson, nicknamed Noodles. The movie jumps around a bit, starting in 1933 (when Noodles is an adult); then jumping 30 years to 1968 (when he is an old man), going back in the 1920s (when he is a kid) and so on. The theme that Leone tries to display to the viewer's is about a man filled with regret and remorse from the way his life turned out, as well as the fate of his friends. I like this. But Leone throws in so many scenes that aren't relevant to the plot. One, is the numerous amounts of sex sequences. Within the first hour of the film, teenage boys are seen doing an obese teen prostitute. How is this pertinent to the movie? It isn't. Later on, there are two very graphic rape scenes. Immediately, this puts me off. What's worse is, is that Noodles commits these. They are very painful to watch and they have no purpose to story at all. Ten minutes right here could have been cut. Perhaps though, these instances are thrown in to show how despicable Noodles and gangsters really are.They are despicable, yet other Hollywood features such as The Godfather, Goodfellas, and even Scarface somehow hold the magic of making thugs the people to care about. In Once Upon A Time In America, there is no one to like or care for, except for the innocent bystanders that get murdered or horribly maimed through the duration of the film. This is what the movie lacks; a reason to sit through the film. Without a character to care about, what's the purpose in watching a film? I guess Leone wanted the viewers to see the ugly side of nature, and not so much of an epic story about loss and regret. In addition, there are other scenes that drag the film to the point of a bore fest. One is a three-minute scene of a kid tempted to eat a desert that he was going to original use to impress a girl. Another is an elongated sequence of a phone ringing. Another is a young gal wondering in a dark room to find a lamp to illuminate the set. Again, what's the point in these? Leone is a master of making scenes move by at a slow pace. This is good for his westerns when the good and bad guy square off for a final duel, but not for a kid wanting to eat a desert. Scenes like this divert from the story, making it dull and hard to pay attention to. Leone may have well have added a 5-minute scene of Noodles sitting on the toilet, grunting. In contrast, important scenes and characters are left merely implied. One that comes to mind is Joe Pesci's character. He's such a great actor, but he's only in 1 scene and disappears from radar completely, and you'd think he's the type of character you'd see again. Another is the whole bank job that the gang was going to pull off. It was a setup, but it would've been interesting to see how it unfolded, rather than merely told by a character in the feature. The acting is not too bad; I was thoroughly impressed by the child actors. Unfortunately there is an awful miscast, Elizabeth McGovern as Noodles love interest. She looked bored through the whole film. Hearing her talk is like listening to nails on a chalkboard. Even Noodles makes the remark to her later in the film, You're a lousy actress. I chuckled at that, catching a little inside joke there. I may come off as seeming to hate this movie. Believe it or not, I don't. The cinematographer pulled off some sweeping shots of New York City. The sets and costumes are exquisite, and I love Ennio Morricone's score. I'll admit that at times, Morricone's score was over sentimental and bombastic in some key scenes. The gangster flick is a genre I enjoy, but Once Upon A Time In America is not qualified as a great one in my book.

(The film was directed by Richard Donner, who also directed Gibson in Maverick and the Lethal Weapon series). Jerry is an obsessive conspiracy theorist who habitually who lectures his passengers on his various theories. He believes, for example, that the fathers of Nobel Prize winners are being kidnapped by the authorities and forced to become sperm donors. He believes that NASA is trying to kill the President using a secret weapon on the Space Shuttle that can trigger earthquakes. And he believes that the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world. Or was it Mel Gibson himself who said that? Strange how life can imitate art and actors start behaving like the characters they once portrayed.The film is not, however, simply a psychological study of an eccentric oddball. It is, in fact, an action-thriller; one of Jerry's theories actually proves to be true; it involves a conspiracy by the CIA and other American government agencies to brainwash people in order to sue them as assassins. I won't try and set out the plot, which is extremely complex and at times confusing, in any detail, but it involves the efforts of Jerry and Alice Sutton, a young lawyer with the US Justice Department, to expose this conspiracy. Alice is trying to find out the truth about the murder of her father, whom she believes may have been killed by the conspirators.This is a fairly standard thriller plot; the genre frequently involves conspiracies by people in high places to commit some dark deed or other. Julia Roberts, who plays Alice here, starred in two other films of this type in the nineties, The Pelican Brief and I Love Trouble, although this second example treated the theme in a more light-hearted way and also included romantic comedy elements.There are, indeed, attempts to inject both romance and comedy into Conspiracy Theory, although both fall rather flat. The main problem with the film, apart from the fact that the plot is difficult to follow, is that, despite Gibson's best efforts to make him likable, Jerry remains, at bottom, a nutcase, and nutcases do not generally make credible screen heroes, and certainly not credible romantic heroes. Alice, of course, ends up falling for Jerry, even though in real life, any sane woman would run a mile from him, probably while telling herself that not every lunatic is actually in an asylum. It is hard to regard as love's young dream the sort of man who is so paranoid that he padlocks the coffee and sugar canisters in his kitchen.There are two ways in which one could make a film about a character like Jerry Fletcher, either as a character-driven psychological drama or as a black comedy. In either case the character would probably have to be dealt with much less indulgently than he is here. A paranoid conspiracy theorist as romantic hero just doesn't work, even if there turns out to be a rational explanation for his paranoia. The film achieves little, other than the presumably unintended achievement of making extremist views seem slightly more acceptable. Both Gibson and Roberts have much more distinguished entries on their CVs than this one. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 July 2011","score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" In Conspiracy Theory Mel Gibson plays Jerry Fletcher, a New York taxi driver.

(The film was directed by Richard Donner, who also directed Gibson in Maverick and the Lethal Weapon series). Jerry is an obsessive conspiracy theorist who habitually who lectures his passengers on his various theories. He believes, for example, that the fathers of Nobel Prize winners are being kidnapped by the authorities and forced to become sperm donors. He believes that NASA is trying to kill the President using a secret weapon on the Space Shuttle that can trigger earthquakes. And he believes that the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world. Or was it Mel Gibson himself who said that? Strange how life can imitate art and actors start behaving like the characters they once portrayed.The film is not, however, simply a psychological study of an eccentric oddball.

Baise-Moi does try to explore those ideas, but it falls far short of that task for a number of reasons 1) The Characters The two leads of the film, Nadine and Manu to their credit aren't badly performed at all. I was able to see a relationship that transcended that of a sexual nature and was filled with a genuine affection - you can see that once they had become bonded they almost became a single entity, functioning as two parts of one whole never in conflict with each other but with the world around them.The problem is that the characters lose sympathy from the audience through their actions, and It's not because they commit horrendous acts of violence or engage in sexual activity with strangers. It is possible to see characters do such things and still root for them - one need only consider characters such as Tony Soprano to accept that. But the actions of Nadine and Manu seem arbitrary. They'll have sex with some people, and kill others and its rarely clear why. In fact towards the end of the film the enter a sex club and massacre an entire room of people who are exploring and engaging in sex in a consensual manner even though these people are doing exactly what Nadine and Manu have spent their time doing. I struggled to understand what their ideology was - there didn't seem to be any clear rules or logic that could be applied to what they were doing. As an audience we don't always have to sympathize with a character, but if we can't empathize with them then their choices end up being unbelievable and we lose all stake in the film.2) The Plot. The main problem with the plot is that the film doesn't really have one and it lacks proper structure. We have a first act where we are introduced to the main characters and witness their first meeting and a end goal is set up - that of meeting another character in Vosges to help them in some kind of border smuggling enterprise, the details of which are never really made clear. Thus we enter the second act and are given the impression that this is to be a road film - a journey into the darkest corners of human interaction where all inhibitions are banished as the character's race, almost eagerly towards self destruction.We do see Nadine and Manu engage in sex and murder in an almost decadent fashion, and we see them reflect on the nature of their partnership. But there is no sense of a journey here. The films goes from one scene to another with no sense of progression. The characters seem relatively unchanged from their first act of murder and it doesn't feel as if they are really physically journeying anywhere either. It almost feels as if they're just driving around randomly - there is no sense of an overall plot progression here at all. Characters are randomly introduced and dispatched without forwarding the overall plot in any real sense.3) The Cinematography I don't know a lot about camera work or cinematography so I won't go on about it at length but from a lay-man's point of view it felt pretty weak. Obviously this is a low budget film that had to make do with what could be afforded and I totally accept that. But the camera work constantly felt to me as if it was neglecting to play to the strengths of being able to use a hand-held camera to get a sense of realism. It always felt like the director was trying to use the camera as if it was a big budget high quality one. Unfortunately the low quality nature of the shots makes the film feel like a pale amateur imitator of other films. To sum up then, the reason Baise-Moi fails as a film for me isn't the explicit or shocking nature of the film. The makers of this film clearly decided that they wanted to be unflinching in their examination of the darker recesses of human society and I see that as a legitimate attempt to create a piece of art. Also the acting, while not award winning is for the most part isn't at all terrible and the two leads carry the film well as much as is possible. The problem lies ultimately with the script - which lacks a coherent 3 act structure. It feels as if the writer started out trying to set up a story-line with a first act that introduces the main characters and gives them an end goal and sets up a story about a journey. But then just got bored and decided to craft a series of scenes that pay homage to other road films that explore sex and violence, but failed to understand what made those films work. The end result comes off as amateurish and hackneyed and makes it look as if the film was made purely for shock value rather than to explore explicit themes in an unflinching manner.Ultimately the films attempts to explore sex and violence in an explicit manner but fails as a piece of art. In doing so it hands those who would try to censor artful expression an example that furthers their goal rather than contradicts it. 3\/10.

Living up to a lineup like that is a tall order but this film manages it.For those unfamiliar with Steinbeck's novel, the story concerns a family of depression era farmers who are forced off their land in Oklahoma. They resolve to travel to California in order to seek work but are continually beset with hardships as their hopes are dashed time and again. The screenplay, adapted by Nunally Johnson, was rewarded with an Oscar nomination.The cast features Henry Fonda in one of his most iconic roles, that of recently paroled Tom Joad. He instills his character with a keen sense of justice, matched with the will to fight back when driven to do so. He was nominated for an Oscar but lost out to James Stewart for his performance in The Philadelphia Story. I expect that was mainly due to Stewart losing out the year before for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Jane Darwell, on the other hand, saw her Oscar nomination turn into a win. As Ma Joad, she was an effective counterpoint to Fonda's character. A couple of other standouts in support were John Carradine as a disillusioned former preacher and John Qualen in a small role.In terms of technique, the film is practically flawless. John Ford's direction is impeccable and the Gregg Toland cinematography is excellent. Ford took home an Oscar for his work but, strangely, Toland wasn't even nominated. For that matter, Alfred Newman's stirring score wasn't nominated either (perhaps because it's mostly based on the song Red River Valley).I haven't read the novel but I know that the storyline of the film deviates from the novel somewhat, particularly when it comes to the ending.

Living up to a lineup like that is a tall order but this film manages it.For those unfamiliar with Steinbeck's novel, the story concerns a family of depression era farmers who are forced off their land in Oklahoma. They resolve to travel to California in order to seek work but are continually beset with hardships as their hopes are dashed time and again. The screenplay, adapted by Nunally Johnson, was rewarded with an Oscar nomination.The cast features Henry Fonda in one of his most iconic roles, that of recently paroled Tom Joad. He instills his character with a keen sense of justice, matched with the will to fight back when driven to do so. He was nominated for an Oscar but lost out to James Stewart for his performance in The Philadelphia Story. I expect that was mainly due to Stewart losing out the year before for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Jane Darwell, on the other hand, saw her Oscar nomination turn into a win. As Ma Joad, she was an effective counterpoint to Fonda's character. A couple of other standouts in support were John Carradine as a disillusioned former preacher and John Qualen in a small role.In terms of technique, the film is practically flawless. John Ford's direction is impeccable and the Gregg Toland cinematography is excellent. Ford took home an Oscar for his work but, strangely, Toland wasn't even nominated. For that matter, Alfred Newman's stirring score wasn't nominated either (perhaps because it's mostly based on the song Red River Valley).I haven't read the novel but I know that the storyline of the film deviates from the novel somewhat, particularly when it comes to the ending.

The first film is one of my childhood favorites and still holds up to this day. I'm not alone in this either, I didn't realize what kind of a following the film had and that others watched it as children too. I watched the second one when I got the package and thought it was alright, I also thought the title was pretty funny. Wouldn't it be hilarious if some person got a lawyer for false advertising because of the title of the Neverending Story? Anyways, the second one is just an alright film, a little below average but not terrible. Now, something about the third on gave me chills when I grabbed it, I think I should have listened to my instincts. I don't even know where to start with the badness. Now everything that was charming about the first film, throw it out! Everything that was trying to continue the story in the second film, throw it out! This is what was puked up from the two films and it's terrifying.Bastian Balthazar has begun a new chapter in his life. His father has re-married, and now Bastian has a new step mother, Jane, whose daughter Nicole is displeased at having a new family. Bastian has also started high school, where he has become victim to the Nasties, a quintet of bullies led by Slip. He manages to get them expelled by the janitor after they trap him in the boiler room. He flees to the library where he is surprised to find Mr. Koreander and The Neverending Story. The Nasties locate him, but he uses the book to escape to Fantasia. Bastian arrives in Fantasia, where he is reunited with old friends. However, the Nasties find the Neverending Story and use their cruelty to bombard the land with fireballs and a storm and now plan to steal the amulet to grant their own nasty wishes.See, normally I like bad films, however this was just bad. For God's sake, Valcor was this beautiful majestic wise dragon who spoke so wonderfully and made you feel special, this Valcor looks like a thrown out in the dumpster Chuck-E-Cheese costume. Not to mention the voice is completely different and sounds like some kind of ridicules Gilligan mook. Then the rock monster, who in the first film was the saddest figure, a giant who lost his friends to the Nothing and felt sorrow and spoke so beautiful now has a family, his wife talks like Arnold Schwartzenegger, he's now 1\/5 his size and his kid wants to go on a motorcycle ride with him while he sings Born to be Wild. The villain is no longer an entity; it's a group of bullies called The Nasties being led by Jack Black (LOL).There is nothing redeeming about this film. The acting is terrible and the only decent enough performance is Jack Black who you can understand why he was successful because as much of a bad story as this is, he looked like he was having fun. The costumes are just terrible and don't resemble the first film by a long shot. In short, the story is just horrendous and the magic is taken away in this film. Please take my advice, stick to the first film, it's a wonderful fantasy film that is filled with beauty and wonder. The second film isn't bad either, it's worth checking out in some ways. Take the advice of the movie We must not give into the Nasty! 1\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 July 2011","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" OK, a few years ago I found at Target a package with all three Neverending Story films, also really cheap, so I picked them up.

Well, she's a bit of both but I would argue that at the end of the day she is a good person, who only knows a certain way of life which isn't exactly the right way but you see her growth in maturity and character throughout the film. There are moments when you realise that she has determination and strength to rise above situations and she really surprises you, in a good way, in certain ways which makes you grow respect for her character. You can't help but like her or be interested by her no matter what you think of her. Also, it would be wrong to not mention Clark Gables brilliant performance as Rhett Butler. He was so different from the gentlemen that in those days was of the norm, but the chemistry between Scarlett and Rhett was perfect, totally convincing and brilliant to watch. But the whole casting was spot on, every character was interesting and likable and all gave everything into their characters.
