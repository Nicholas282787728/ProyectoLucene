I'm a guy that loves a good romance story. I like chick flicks, sue me. I was looking forward to this one after enjoying Sleepless in Seattle. This movie was as phony as a two-dollar bill. Please spare me the Magic of movies BS as well. These were not real people as far as I'm concerned. Hanks and Ryan's characters are so poorly written that I didn't care about them or their plights. I also thought that despite all the evidence to the contrary, Meg Ryan's character never realized that Joe was her online love interest. It took almost two hours for her to figure it out fully? Give me a break. I love both Tom Hanks & Meg Ryan, but this is a rather boring romantic comedy that did absolutely nothing for me. Believe it or not. This was the third collaboration between Hanks & Ryan. The first two were Joe Vs The Volcano and Sleepless in Seattle. Sleepless in Seattle was far from perfect as well, but it was at least charming. This movie tries so hard to replicate the success of that movie, but it isn't creative enough to pull it off. The storyline is potentially a winner, but it is done very generically. When all is said and done, it's your typical I hate you, love you storyline that you've seen many times. Another problem with this movie, is that it's rather mundane. There were a few occasions where I looked at the time to see how much was left. The performances are alright. Tom Hanks is solid as per usual, but I wouldn't say he's at his best. His character is a bit too unsympathetic for most of the movie. Meg Ryan can do this type of stuff in her sleep. She's witty and charming, but a bit uninspired. Their chemistry felt off as well. David Chapelle is OK as the comedic relief. The last 15 minutes are actually good. It left me wondering where this was in the first place when this movie sorely needed it. I didn't hate it, I just didn't care for it at all. It has it's moments, but not nearly enough of them. The star power is enough to make this a watchable experience, but don't expect many sparks or magic. 5.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 March 2014","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" A modern romance set in New York.

It's peace-time in the early 60s before the Vietnam War. Bull is ultra-charismatic but flawed. At any given time you either love him or hate him; you'll see this same struggle with his family members. He generally treats them like Marine subordinates which, for the most part, works and they seem to have a lot of good times together, but there's a dark side as Bull is overly competitive, especially with his just-turning-18 son Ben (Michael O'Keefe). Perhaps this is because he's a warrior without a war and he has to fight\/win someone. He's also an alcoholic, albeit a functional one. The story details the family's good times and bad times.If you're in the mood for a good drama you can't go wrong with The Great Santini. Although there are a few comedic moments, which are life-like in nature, this is essentially a serious study on the joys & agonies of family dynamics. The story offers numerous insights to ponder, which makes it a great film for repeat viewings.Many times during the film I was reminded of my growing-up years. In Bull Meechum I see a bit of my father.The one-on-one basketball game between Bull and his son is an exceptional scene. The rest of the family is watching and cheering. They're all having a fun time until it takes an unexpected dark turn. Bull can't handle losing to his son and responds like a total jerk. Yet it smacks of real life. Years ago I was playing chess with my wife on a Lake Erie beach and she beat me, which wasn't usual, and for some reason I got upset about it, perhaps because I wasn't in the best of moods to start with. Looking back, of course, I see how pathetic it was.Unlike Bull and Ben in the film I didn't have an actual relationship with my father. Generally, the only time he'd talk to me was when he was calling me names, cussing me out or telling me I was never going to amount to anything. One day, when I was 15 and my father was in his mid-50s, I was in my room upstairs and my dad started yelling at me from the bottom of the stairs. I couldn't really hear what he was saying and, mumbling, just kinda blew it off. He then ran up the stairs yelling and charged into my room in a rage. If he ever ran at me in such a manner in the past I would just flee the scene, but in this case I was cornered and had nowhere to run. Hence, we went at, the first and only time (physically), father against son. As great as his rage was, mine was greater. Don't get me wrong, I believe in honoring parents and all, but at that point I couldn't take anymore. I was done with the names, the cuss-outs and the deadly curses (e.g. You're gonna turn to $#!&). I was able to put him in a headlock fairly quickly and squeezed tight until his entire head turned beet red. I then let him go and he walked out of the room muttering, defeated. And no wonder, he was in physical decline while I was just entering my prime. Strangely, in weeks and months to come he would brag on me about the incident.Why do I bring this personal story up? Because the film is so true-to-life that it will likely stir up growing-up memories for any adult viewer, pleasant and unpleasant, happy and sad.The eldest daughter, the redhead, is played by Lisa Jane Persky. She initially comes off as eccentric, geeky and not very attractive, but wait until you see her on prom night later in the picture. If I was 18 I'd take her out without a second thought. Anyway, go to IMDb and check out a couple of recent pictures of her and witness what a truly beautiful woman she grew up to be.I should also point out that the film has a good, authentic Southern vibe like a handful of other films, e.g. Mississippi Burning, Ode To Billy Joe, Cat People (the remake) and even (believe it or not) Squirm. There's so much more I could say about this picture, but I'll leave it for you to discover.

He started the role in 1973 when he was 45 years old and ended his 7-film run at the age of 57 in 1985. His fourth film was THE SPY WHO LOVED ME released in 1977. I used to believe this was the best film of his stint, but after seeing all the Moore pictures recently I no longer feel this way. THE SPY WHO LOVES ME has some aspects that are as good or better than any of the other films in Moore's stint, but it also has a couple of weak elements that make it one of the worst. Allow me to explain as I point out the films strengths and weaknesses THE PLOT James Bond teams up with female Russian agent XXX (yeah right) to prevent world-hating Karl Stromberg from starting World War III by stealing nuclear subs. Stromberg doesn't care if the world kills itself because he lives as a mad recluse on a crab-like submersible dream home called Atlantis. The giant steel-toothed Jaws assists Stromberg along with the beautiful raven-haired Naomi.WHAT WORKS The top item I demand in any Bond flick is exciting globe-trotting and, consequently, great locations. THE SPY WHO LOVED ME delivers in spades. Heck, the opening teaser starts with a thrilling ski chase that culminates in a spectacular jump from Baffin Island's Mt. Asgard (Canada). The DVD is worth owning for this incredible stunt alone. From there we get the Sahara desert, Cairo, the Nile River and the great pyramids of Giza, as well as the Italian Mediterranean island of Sardinia, Scotland and the Bahamas. These are all fabulous locations to say the least.Richard Kiel as the giant Jaws is both intimidating and amusing. The on-going joke is that NOTHING can stop or kill him.Barbara Bach is good as Agent XXX and certainly possesses an exotic beauty, but watch her get blown out of the water by the gorgeous Caroline Munro when she is introduced as Naomi. Many cite Ursula Andress' coming out of the water in a white bikini in DR. NO as the ultimate Bond-babe moment but Caroline's introduction here is a serious rival; it's, at least, the second best Bond-babe moment. The only problem with Caroline's role is that it's too brief. Check her out in THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD (1974) to see her in a more prominent role.Some editions of the DVD include an over-40-minute documentary on THE SPY WHO LOVED ME that includes a fairly recent interview with Ms. Munro. Believe it or not, she's almost as beautiful today as she was back in 1977, not to mention she has a vibrant, pleasant and humble personality.Another great aspect of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is that its fun globe-trotting sequences give it an undeniable Indiana Jones feel, even though it was made four years before the first Indiana Jones flick. WATCH OUT for the great sequence where Bond's car turns into a submarine as he attempts to flee Naomi in a helicopter.WHAT DOESN'T WORK Many compositions in Bond films are timeless, like FOR YOUR EYES ONLY from 1981, but the disco score to THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is horribly dated. Still, it doesn't personally bug me that much. I can live with it. Others can't.The main problem with THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is that Stromberg and his mad scheme fail to sustain the viewer's interest. Every time I see this film I run out of interest by the 90-minute mark (with a full 35 minutes to go). Don't get me wrong, the many globe-trotting sequences are fun and exciting, certainly some of the best in the entire series, but the story as a whole runs out of steam about an hour and a half into it. The last 30 minutes contain numerous fight\/action scenes but they're boring; the viewer simply doesn't care about the outcome. By contrast, the other six Moore films retain the viewer's interest from beginning to end with no problem, yes, even THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN, MOONRAKER and A VIEW TO A KILL.So THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is in some ways the best film of the Moore era, but in others the worst. Regardless, it's a mandatory purchase or rental if you're in the mood for a mindless, high-energy Bond flick.As for Roger Moore's take on Bond. I guess you either like him or you don't. I like him. Regardless of his age Moore always looked great and perfectly convincing as 007 throughout his run.Back in 2003 I saw most of the Bond films (the ones I didn't see I was already well familiar, like GOLDFINGER) and concluded that Roger Moore's seven films are the most consistently entertaining. Yes, Sean Connery is great and his stint is generally more serious, but who can deny the color and vibrancy of the Moore films? All of his pictures are incredibly entertaining and were hugely successful at the box office. Even the heavily maligned MOONRAKER and A VIEW TO A KILL are great. They may have more goofy or amusing elements, which are actually funny by the way, but they remain essentially serious stories; they rarely go overboard into the rut of parody or camp. Seriously, I get sick of hearing all the complaints about Moore's stint in the series. All of his films are great Bond adventures. There's not a dud in the bunch.

THE SPY WHO LOVES ME has some aspects that are as good or better than any of the other films in Moore's stint, but it also has a couple of weak elements that make it one of the worst. Allow me to explain as I point out the films strengths and weaknesses THE PLOT James Bond teams up with female Russian agent XXX (yeah right) to prevent world-hating Karl Stromberg from starting World War III by stealing nuclear subs. Stromberg doesn't care if the world kills itself because he lives as a mad recluse on a crab-like submersible dream home called Atlantis. The giant steel-toothed Jaws assists Stromberg along with the beautiful raven-haired Naomi.WHAT WORKS The top item I demand in any Bond flick is exciting globe-trotting and, consequently, great locations. THE SPY WHO LOVED ME delivers in spades. Heck, the opening teaser starts with a thrilling ski chase that culminates in a spectacular jump from Baffin Island's Mt. Asgard (Canada). The DVD is worth owning for this incredible stunt alone. From there we get the Sahara desert, Cairo, the Nile River and the great pyramids of Giza, as well as the Italian Mediterranean island of Sardinia, Scotland and the Bahamas. These are all fabulous locations to say the least.Richard Kiel as the giant Jaws is both intimidating and amusing. The on-going joke is that NOTHING can stop or kill him.Barbara Bach is good as Agent XXX and certainly possesses an exotic beauty, but watch her get blown out of the water by the gorgeous Caroline Munro when she is introduced as Naomi. Many cite Ursula Andress' coming out of the water in a white bikini in DR. NO as the ultimate Bond-babe moment but Caroline's introduction here is a serious rival; it's, at least, the second best Bond-babe moment. The only problem with Caroline's role is that it's too brief. Check her out in THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD (1974) to see her in a more prominent role.Some editions of the DVD include an over-40-minute documentary on THE SPY WHO LOVED ME that includes a fairly recent interview with Ms. Munro. Believe it or not, she's almost as beautiful today as she was back in 1977, not to mention she has a vibrant, pleasant and humble personality.Another great aspect of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is that its fun globe-trotting sequences give it an undeniable Indiana Jones feel, even though it was made four years before the first Indiana Jones flick. WATCH OUT for the great sequence where Bond's car turns into a submarine as he attempts to flee Naomi in a helicopter.WHAT DOESN'T WORK Many compositions in Bond films are timeless, like FOR YOUR EYES ONLY from 1981, but the disco score to THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is horribly dated. Still, it doesn't personally bug me that much. I can live with it. Others can't.The main problem with THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is that Stromberg and his mad scheme fail to sustain the viewer's interest. Every time I see this film I run out of interest by the 90-minute mark (with a full 35 minutes to go). Don't get me wrong, the many globe-trotting sequences are fun and exciting, certainly some of the best in the entire series, but the story as a whole runs out of steam about an hour and a half into it. The last 30 minutes contain numerous fight\/action scenes but they're boring; the viewer simply doesn't care about the outcome. By contrast, the other six Moore films retain the viewer's interest from beginning to end with no problem, yes, even THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN, MOONRAKER and A VIEW TO A KILL.So THE SPY WHO LOVED ME is in some ways the best film of the Moore era, but in others the worst. Regardless, it's a mandatory purchase or rental if you're in the mood for a mindless, high-energy Bond flick.As for Roger Moore's take on Bond. I guess you either like him or you don't. I like him. Regardless of his age Moore always looked great and perfectly convincing as 007 throughout his run.Back in 2003 I saw most of the Bond films (the ones I didn't see I was already well familiar, like GOLDFINGER) and concluded that Roger Moore's seven films are the most consistently entertaining. Yes, Sean Connery is great and his stint is generally more serious, but who can deny the color and vibrancy of the Moore films? All of his pictures are incredibly entertaining and were hugely successful at the box office. Even the heavily maligned MOONRAKER and A VIEW TO A KILL are great. They may have more goofy or amusing elements, which are actually funny by the way, but they remain essentially serious stories; they rarely go overboard into the rut of parody or camp. Seriously, I get sick of hearing all the complaints about Moore's stint in the series. All of his films are great Bond adventures. There's not a dud in the bunch.

The Little Princess was a pretty good adapted movie. I wouldn't say, it's the best adaption of the novel, because it's far from that. In my opinion, the film should had been title 'The Soldier's Daughter' because how different, it was with the novel. Directed by Walter Lang, the movie is about 12 year old, Sara Crewe (Shirley Temple) whom father, Captain Crewe (Ian Hunter) is called to fight in the Second Boer War. Sara is left behind in the care of Amanda Minchin (Mary Nash), the head of an exclusive private school for girls, where she lives in a princess like lifestyle due to her father's riches. Her life as a princess wasn't long, as Captain Crewe's money dry up, and her father is believe to be dead in the battlefield. Miss Minchin harshly force the young woman to serve under her making her life miserable. This doesn't stop Sara's will power and belief that her father isn't dead; and she do anything to find out if he's still alive. Although it maintained the novel's Victorian London setting, the film introduced several new characters like Richard Greene and Anita Louise as the young romantic couple, Sir Geoffrey Hamilton & Miss Rose. They're employees of the boarding school, whom go against the wishes of Miss Minchin. Then there is mean-spirited Lord Wickham (Miles Mander) who has Ram Dass (Cesar Romero) as an Indian servant under him. It isn't really explained why he has an Indian lascar for a servant, and there is no logical explanation for why he would want to redecorate Sara's garret room. I guess, having an Indian sailor next room seem too unrealistic in Victoria Era England to the filmmakers. Another character added is Hubert (Arthur Treacher) who became friends with Sara over music. One thing, way different than the novel is the musical number. I know a lot of Shirley Temple's previous films had this, but this movie lacks music and songs good enough to remember. Shirley Temple and Arthur Treacher had a musical number together, performing the song Knocked 'Em in the Old Kent Road which was way too short. Temple also appeared in an extended ballet dream sequence that was a bit distracting from the main plot. The whole dream scene was just awful and felt like filler. Another big change is the storyline. The movie used the Second Boer War and the Siege of Mafeking as a backdrop. In the book, the father was just visiting India and got ill to the point, he got brain fever. It wasn't war. The film covers only a timeline of a year, while the book go nearly four years. One of the biggest change in the film is the ending. The film's ending was drastically different. Without spoiling too much of it; this adaptation changes the fate of Captain Crewe. In my opinion, it's a better ending than the book. Still, it's does kinda mess up the plot of a young adult learning how to deal with death and to better herself through the actions of her own well-being. I just didn't like the whole Queen Victoria cameo helping her find her father. It was just outlandish & unrealistic. I can do without all the over Patriotism oozes out of every scene of the film. The main film is about this girl trying to reunite with her father, not the Boer War. Second off, there is no Mr. Thomas Carrisford character in the film. The acting in the film were pretty alright, but nobody really stood out. Shirley looked a little old for the part, but she pulls it off. At the part when she was by the window crying to say goodbye to her daddy was emotional. It was nice to see her react in a film to things like loss and death in a story. The trouble is, she can't pull off the emotion of making herself cry. In the movie, Shirley portrays a child not only with steadfast hope but patience, manners, politeness and kindness in the face of appalling adversity that you rarely see in film today. Who would believe that a child under that pressure could be so gracious? I love when Shirley as Sarah does snap back against her bullies like taunting from Lavinia (Marcia Mae Jones). I have to say, if the film was little bit more dark, it would had work better. It remind me of a Charles Dicken's novel. The director did good on keeping his camera low down, at a child's eye-level. Also striking is his use of multiple angles which really gives dimension to the sets or highlighting a sudden change in mood. This movie was the first Shirley Temple movie to be filmed completely in Technicolor as before that, producers believe these incredibly bright lights produced so much heat that a child, Temple's age would be hurt working under such conditions. Sadly, this was her last major success as a child star. The film is easy to find since it's in the public domain due to the failure to renew its copyright registration. This means that virtually anyone could duplicate and sell a VHS\/DVD copy of the film. Therefore, many of the versions of this film available on the market are either severely or usually badly edited. Some DVDs have really extremely poor quality, having been duped from second- or third-generation or more copies of the film. So watch out for that. There are countless remakes of the novel since then. In my opinion 1995's A Little Princess directed by Alfonso Cuaron was a bit better one than this, but this Little Princess is widely considered to be one of Shirley Temple's best film and I have to agree. Enjoyable tale for children and adults alike. So check it out.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family"},{"date":"13 March 2014","score":"","review":" Released in 1998, Simon Birch was directed and written by Mark Steven Johnson (Daredevil, Ghost Rider) loosely based on John Irving's novel A Prayer for Owen Meany.The story takes place in 1964 coastal Maine and involves two misfit friends, both 12 years old, both outcasts Simon a dwarf and Joe a bastard child.Despite his challenging condition, Simon believes there's a reason he's a dwarf and that God has a purpose for him and more. Does he have any proof for this belief? No. It's just something he knows.Joe, on the other hand, desperately wants to know who his father is. His mother (Ashley Judd) got pregnant during her senior year in high school but she never revealed the identity of the father. Much of the story involves Simon and Joe trying to figure out who Joe's father is.The reality of Simon's condition is driven home when Joe tells him a local girl finds him cute. Simon responds, She means cute like a baby turtle is cute. Girls don't kiss baby turtles. How do you know, Joe asks. I just know. If you were me you'd know too.Simon Birch is reminiscent of 1994's Forrest Gump. Both are named after their protagonist, both take place in the 60s, both involve outcasts who are challenged mentally or physically, both have the same style, both are heavy and light at the same time -- serious drama balanced out by humor and tragedy. Director\/writer Johnson was obviously shooting for the next Forrest Gump.Although Birch isn't as good as Gump it's pretty good. Unlike Gump it failed at the box office, making only $18 million in the USA while costing $20 million, but word-of-mouth has spread.For the first 10 minutes or so I wasn't sure if I was going to buy into the film's inevitable contrivances and melodramatics, but the next thing I knew I was sucked into the story and having a good time. When it was all over I had a lot of things to reflect on. In fact, I watched it again. Yes, there are some Yeah, right moments but watch a few old b&w flicks where contrivances and melodramatics are a way of life. A film can get away with being a tad unlikely or sentimental if it plays its cards right.One scene involves a baseball hitting someone in the head. This brought to memory something that happened when I was around 8 years old My family and I were walking the trails of Theodore Wirth Park in Minneapolis when we came to the edge of a baseball field. As soon as we entered the outfield somehow I just knew that the current batter was going to hit the ball and it was going to hit me right in the face. I knew it but I didn't know how I knew. I just knew. Next thing you know the batter hits the ball into the air -- it was like slow motion -- and it came and hit me right on the cheek! (The only good thing was I think it was a softball). How did I KNOW this was going to happen? I don't know, but it's pretty amazing. I bring this up not only because there's a similar scene in Simon Birch but also because I believe it relates to Simon knowing and believing he had a purpose and was going to die a hero.The idea of Simon dying is no spoiler, by the way. It's revealed right from the start that Simon and someone else would die before the film ends. This, of course, softens the shock when they do and allows the tale to play as bittersweet nostalgia. Some people call the story sad and tragic, but it's not. We know right from the get-go who's going to die. We just don't know when and how. Besides, everyone dies sooner or later (but not every one grows up).This is the first and only film I've ever seen Ashley Judd in and she's ANGELIC. Seriously, Ashley is the definition of spirituality, not to mention stunningly beautiful.Another likable character is Ben Goodrich, played by Oliver Platt. He assumes the father-figure role to both Simon and Joe, but he's very natural about it, not pushy.Some of the themes addressed are-- Order, purpose and love in a bloody realm of chaos. -- It's possible to be religious but not spiritual. -- If you KNOW something in your heart, never give up or stop believing. -- Who is your real father, the man from whose loins you came or the one who loves & mentors you? -- The conflict of flesh and spirit, random chance and order, meaningless existence or purposeful life. -- Sex\/romance can cause you to make really stoo-pid mistakes. -- Going through religious motions but no longer really believing. -- Religion and truth are not one in the same. A person can get bogged down in the mire of human religion and miss the point. Truth sets FREE.The characters are likable. There's some crudeness and cussing, but it reflects real life rather than crudeness for the sake of crudeness. Even the 'villains' are not totally unlikable or without sympathy. Rev. Russell comes across more as a man who's simply lost his way while going through the motions rather than a man out to abuse people. Same thing with the Sunday school teacher.Watch out for the laugh-out-loud scene involving the manger, the baby Jesus and the girl who plays the virgin Mary.Jim Carrey has a small role as Joe when he's an adult, bookending the film and narrating. The locations are gorgeous, filmed in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, and on the French River in Ontario.GRADE B ","genre":null},{"date":"13 March 2014","score":"","review":" Released in 1998, Simon Birch was directed and written by Mark Steven Johnson (Daredevil, Ghost Rider) loosely based on John Irving's novel A Prayer for Owen Meany.The story takes place in 1964 coastal Maine and involves two misfit friends, both 12 years old, both outcasts Simon a dwarf and Joe a bastard child.Despite his challenging condition, Simon believes there's a reason he's a dwarf and that God has a purpose for him and more.

All of those elements make Menace II Society a great Hood movie,one of the best films of the 1990s and The Hughes Brothers at their best.Set in the South Central Los Angeles section of Watts,California,Menace II Society tells the story of Caine(Tyrin Turner),a street hustler who has just recently graduated from High School and is on the streets. Now,Caine is trying to survive on the streets of Watts either by starting a new life on the positive side or become a victim of the streets.Menace II Society is a brilliant and unforgettable Hood movie classic that came out two years after John Singleton's landmark Hood classic Boyz N The Hood(1991)and if Boyz N The Hood is The Godfather of Hood Movies,then Menace II Society would be the Goodfellas(a film that The Hughes Brothers used as a template)of the Hood genre. Right from it's shocking and disturbing opening scene,Menace II Society is a film that pulls you into a dark,urban nightmare that pulls no punches and is a movie that offers no salvation or safe keeping. Despite the tragedy and sadness that was in Boyz N The Hood you felt that there was hope at the end,but in Menace II Society there is no hope or happiness and you will feel that nothing will be good for the characters. Where as Boyz N The Hood focused on a couple of good kids trying to survive in their neighborhood,Menace II Society gives viewers an unflinching look into the world of Watts,California showing world where most of the main characters are criminals and despite being surrounded by urban decay, violence and death don't seem to be bothered by it but embellish it because it is a way of life in the characters eyes and with some of the characters there is no other way. The carelessness and apathy of the some of the characters gives MIIS a nihilistic outlook that is bleak and at times reminds me of Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange(1971)and Tim Hunter's River's Edge(1987)two other films that also have a bleak overtone. What is also great about MIIS is the style of the movie is almost like a Film Noir whether's Caine's narration or the dark lighting that is in the background that makes the movie realistic and at the same time surreal and dream like. The violence in MIIS is shocking and very brutal with nothing being toned down for the viewers showing how violence is shocking and horrific and when the violence happens it will disturb viewers mentally and physically with it's intensity and power. The violence in MIIS is not meant to be fun or exciting but to send a message that violence keeps happening and it's an on going cycle in the hood and ghetto and the violence also sends a message that the things that you do can come back to bite you in a big way. The main character Caine is a fascinating one because we never know what to make of him as a character he's not a good person but he's not a bad person either he's neither a hero or villain because most of his actions good or bad make him a complex character with depth. Caine is a character who is smart as well and you figured that if it wasn't for him being a street hustler he could've been a doctor or banker but drug dealing and hustling on the street is all that he knew what to do. Even though we don't know Caine is a good guy or bad guy there were some scenes in the movie where we as the viewer have sympathy for Caine whether you agree with his actions or not and he is a character in the film that you will never forget. The ending of Menace II Society is amazing and in my opinion one of the most powerful and devastating endings I have ever seen on film and the first time you see the ending it will punch you in the stomach because the ending is something that you will never expect to be so intense and truly gut-wrenching. The ending in Menace II Society will stick with you after you watch it and is one of the reasons the film is a Hood classic. An amazing ending to a great film.The cast is wonderful. Tyrin Turner is excellent as Caine,with Turner bringing sympathy and intensity to the role. Jada Pinkett is wonderful as Ronnie,a friend that Caine looks after. Larenz Tate is brilliant,unforgettable and menacing as O-Dog,Caine's trigger happy friend. Tate is charismatic and frightening in his performance. Vonte Sweet and Ryan Williams are great as Sharif and Stacy,Caine's good friends. Samuel L. Jackson is terrific as Tat,Caine's Father. Charles S. Dutton is outstanding as Mr. Butler,Sharif's Father who offers words of wisdom to Caine. Bill Duke is captivating as Detective,an officer questioning Caine. Glenn Plummer is incredible as Pernell,Caine's Father figure. Rapper Mc Eiht is good as A-Wax,one of Caine's friends. Clifton Powell does a fine job as Chauncey,a friend of the neighborhood. Arnold Johnson(Thomas Lawson)and Marilyn Coleman(Mrs. Lawson)are fantastic as Caine's Grandparents. The direction by Albert and Allen Hughes(The Hughes Brothers) is amazing,with The Hughes Brothers always moving the camera and bringing a great visual style to the film. Terrific direction,Hughes Brothers.The score by QD III(Quincey Jones III)is impressive and moody and matches the tone of the film. Fine score,Jones. There is also a great song by Mc Eiht called Streiht Up Menace which plays at the end. An outstanding song.In final word,if you love The Hughes Brothers or Hood movies I highly suggest you see Menace II Society,an excellent and powerful Hood classic that you will never forget after watching it.

I myself haven't actually read the King book but I am a big admirer of the Kubrick film. But it does appear that this movie is one that divides opinion like few other horror films. While there are many like me who love it, there are equally many others who find it unscary and unengaging. Not only that but, somewhat bizarrely, it seems to have also attracted a lot of conspiracy theories surrounding supposed hidden messages and subtexts buried within the film. If you don't believe this, watch the recent documentary Room 237 which presents several of these, in my opinion, utterly stupid theories. Basically, there seems to be little middle ground when it comes to opinions on The Shining.I can only speak from the point-of-view of someone who thinks this is a bit of a masterpiece. Kubrick was a director who seemed to make films in different genres that still retained his very personal stamp. In this example I think he shows that the horror genre was pretty well suited to his sensibilities. The cold detachment his films are famous for works really well for this particular story. The setting is a remote isolated hotel in the middle of winter after all. His meticulous attention to detail is evident from the first beautiful soaring shot over a cold lake right until the final extreme zoom. Visually the movie is a tour de force. This was one of the first films to use the Steadicam, which allowed for very smooth mobile camera-work, most notably when we glide through the corridors of the hotel following the boy Danny on his trike. The horror genre also gives Kubrick ample opportunity to construct nightmare-like imagery such as the river of blood that flows out of the lift shaft. But it's the atmosphere that really makes it all work. There are several standout suspense scenes, like the famous axe moment and the ghostly little girls but also others such as the very disturbing encounter in Room 237. Then there is the hotel bar that Jack Torrance visits in moments of despair, replete with swinging 1920's guests. From here we have one of the standout sinister parts of the whole movie, where Torrance has a conversation with the ex-caretaker (and very dead) Grady in the toilet. The conversation is cold and disturbing and sets the wheels in motion for the final horror. Sometimes, though it's the very simple, subtle ideas that generate the biggest chills, such as when Wendy discovers just exactly what it is that her husband has been spending his whole time writing since arrival.The cast is small but excellent. Jack Nicholson is admittedly very over-the-top but he is pretty convincingly intense, Shelley Duvall is very good in a tough role, young Danny Lloyd is one of the rare breed of child actors who can actually act and Scatman Crothers, who plays the cook who recognises Danny's shining ability, is always a welcome presence in any film. But really, the real standout character of this film is the Overlook Hotel itself. Everything happens under its bright lights, there is no typical horror darkness here but this only adds to the terror if anything. It's a place that seems to hold a secret and its vast empty expanses become somewhat sinister once the guests and workers have finally left. Wendy Carlos unusual score accentuates this by punctuating certain moments with tones that imply impending dread. On the whole, The Shining is a movie that doesn't really have any faults for me.

The surname Malone is that of their deceased adoptive parents; they know nothing of their real parents, although Tia has vague memories of her early childhood, including an accident at sea and of an uncle whom she believes drowned white trying to rescue them. The children also have strange psychic powers, including telekinetic abilities, powers of telepathic communication with one another and with animals, and the power to foretell future events. Tia and Tony are placed in an orphanage, where they come to the attention of a millionaire named Aristotle Bolt. Bolt persuades his employee Lucas Deranian to poses as the children's uncle and, with the aid of forged documents, he is able to adopt them from the orphanage. Bolt then offers the supposed family a home in his luxurious mansion. His interest in the children, however, is not philanthropic; he is simply hoping to exploit their abilities for business purposes. Realising that Deranian is not really their uncle and that Bolt is not to be trusted, the children use their powers to escape. Bolt initiates a manhunt to recapture them, but they are sheltered by an eccentric elderly man named Jason O'Day who is touring the country in a motor home.Although this is a children's film, it is one that I tend to remember more for the adults than for its rather anonymous child stars Kim Richards and Ike Eisenmann than for its adult actors; the most memorable child is probably the oddly-named Truck, the bully who makes the siblings' life a misery in the orphanage. Eddie Albert is in great form as Jason, a crusty, embittered yet strangely sympathetic widower, and there are two outstanding villains in the shape of Donald Pleasence as the smoothly plausible Deranian and Ray Milland as the ruthless and sinister Bolt, a man who can seem threatening even when he is ostensibly being beneficent. The Witch Mountain of the title is the place to which the children make their way after their escape from Bolt's mansion and where they eventually discover the reason for their powers. Without giving too much away I can say that the explanation introduces a science-fiction element at a time when Hollywood was just starting to rediscover sci-fi. The genre had temporarily become unpopular after some dreadful examples in the fifties, but by the mid-seventies was starting to recover. The film came out in 1975, the same year as Close Encounters of the Third Kind and two years before the great sci-fi explosion caused by the success of Star Wars. Escape to Witch Mountain is not a grand spectacular along the lines of Star Wars, but it is a well-made and engaging movie, officially made for children but the sort of thing that will keep adults entertained as well. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 March 2014","score":"","review":" At the centre of this movie are two orphans, brother and sister Tony and Tia Malone.

During this time, Walt and his wife, Anne (Aurore Clément), have raised Travis's son, Hunter (Hunter Carson), as their own. This is due to the disappearance of Travis, and Hunter's mother Jane (Nastassja Kinski).The relationships in this movie are very powerful. Love can be a wonderful thing.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"13 March 2014","score":"","review":" The first time I saw this '76 version of King Kong I was disappointed that the dinosaurs contained in the original were no where to be found; and the giant snake just didn't cut it. One of the best features of the original is the thrilling Skull Island sequences with numerous dinosaurs. The Skull Island part on this '76 version is lethargic by comparison (that is, AFTER Kong appears and kidnaps Dwan).The next time I saw it I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. You gotta respect the fact that the filmmakers went for something different than the original. It's like they said, Dinosaurs? We don't need no stinkin' dinosaurs! What they went for, instead, was to highlight Kong's human-ness and how awestruck he was by Dwan's beauty.For instance, Kong walks more like a human than an ape. Apparently Rick Baker, the man in the Kong suit, wanted to walk like an ape but wasn't allowed. This is fitting because, again, the film attempts to emphasize Kong's human-ness.As far as comparisons to the original film and the 2005 version, if we're honest about it this '76 version, albeit flawed, is better or just as good in many areas. Although the original is a masterpiece considering its era, it has quite a few obvious flaws aside from its datedness, e.g. Jack's premature declaration of love for Ann, the blandness of the characters (except Fay), the natives' kidnapping of Ann (Why sure!) and the goofy appearance of Kong himself (all the dinosaurs look great but they couldn't come up with a better, more authentic look for the film's star monster, even though they had apes in zoos to compare with?). As for the 2005 version, it's a fun film but seriously marred by cartooney overkill. It plays out like a Road Runner cartoon more than anything else. It's just impossible to suspend disbelief while watching it.So what's good about this '76 version? - The film has a serious vibe of high adventure. The ship scenes and the initial island sequences with the tribe are great. Take, for instance, when they discover the great wall, ominous music and all.- The score by John Barry is exceptional.- The three main characters are both memorable and likable -- Jack (Jeff Bridges), Dwan (Jessica Lange) and Fred Wilson (Charles Grodin). Bridges in particular makes a distinctive long-haired protagonist. This wasn't the case in the original. Although Fay Wray was fine, the two male leads are bland and forgettable. Even though Fred (Grodin) is a greedy opportunist in this '76 version he's still kinda likable. For instance, he could have kept Jack locked up the entire trip but chooses to give him a job instead. Also, he could have tried to hog all the profits from Kong's capture but shares the 'success' with others, including Dwan and Jack (even though Jack ultimately declines).- The film's worth watching just to catch Jessica in her curvy physical prime. The scenes of her after their initial arrival to the mysterious island are unforgettable! Lange is dressed in skimpy jean shorts and a striped billy shirt and she's just incredible. No wonder Kong became fascinated with her.- The Kaua'i, Hawaii, locations are magnificent! The other two versions don't hold a candle to these breathtaking locations, including Jackson's cartooney CGI jungles.- Kong looks best in this version. Yes, it's just a guy in an ape suit but it works. His facial expressions are great. Kong looks so much better in this version compared to the original that there really is no comparison. Of course, Kong looks great in the 2005 remake as well, but Jackson basically just made Kong out to be a gargantuan gorilla. By contrast, in the original and '76 version Kong is a huge ape with human qualities. I prefer the huge human-like ape over the (mere) giant gorilla.- This version is more adult-oriented and believable. Skull Island is a mysterious island with large animals but no dinosaurs. This makes more sense. The thrilling dino-scenes have been omitted in favor of sequences of a more dramatic nature. I prefer the thrilling dino-encounters but have to respect the risk-taking originality and believability of this version.- This is the only version that shows Kong being transported from the island to the U.S.A. Quite a bit of runtime is devoted to it, in fact.- The World Trade Center (RIP) is featured and the ending is pretty gory; you can't help but sympathize with Kong.WHAT DOESN'T WORK - The giant ape hand\/arm gets the job done but that's about it. It's used too often and moves too slow.- Likewise, the giant snake is okay but that's about it. This sequence required a thrilling battle between two colossal creatures and what we get is pretty weak and forgettable.- The studio sets for the island look fake; they're not much better than the sets seen on the original Star Trek TV series. They should have stayed with the great Kaua'i locations instead of lame studio sets.- The footage of the 40-foot mechanical ape prop shown in the last act for about 4 seconds should have been left on the cutting room floor. It's horrible.Some have criticized that this version is campy but, really, the only remotely campy aspect is the Charles Grodin character. Besides, is he all THAT campy? I've met people like him in real life (take, for instance, when he steps out of the boat on the island to the vainglory of the camera's eye -- it rings true).Aside from Jessica Lange, what I like most about this film is its spirit of high adventure. If you're in the mood for serious high adventure you can't go wrong with this version of King Kong.

They should have stayed with the great Kaua'i locations instead of lame studio sets.- The footage of the 40-foot mechanical ape prop shown in the last act for about 4 seconds should have been left on the cutting room floor. It's horrible.Some have criticized that this version is campy but, really, the only remotely campy aspect is the Charles Grodin character. Besides, is he all THAT campy? I've met people like him in real life (take, for instance, when he steps out of the boat on the island to the vainglory of the camera's eye -- it rings true).Aside from Jessica Lange, what I like most about this film is its spirit of high adventure. If you're in the mood for serious high adventure you can't go wrong with this version of King Kong. GRADE B ","genre":"Adventure, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"13 March 2014","score":"","review":" The first time I saw this '76 version of King Kong I was disappointed that the dinosaurs contained in the original were no where to be found; and the giant snake just didn't cut it. One of the best features of the original is the thrilling Skull Island sequences with numerous dinosaurs. The Skull Island part on this '76 version is lethargic by comparison (that is, AFTER Kong appears and kidnaps Dwan).The next time I saw it I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. You gotta respect the fact that the filmmakers went for something different than the original. It's like they said, Dinosaurs? We don't need no stinkin' dinosaurs! What they went for, instead, was to highlight Kong's human-ness and how awestruck he was by Dwan's beauty.For instance, Kong walks more like a human than an ape. Apparently Rick Baker, the man in the Kong suit, wanted to walk like an ape but wasn't allowed. This is fitting because, again, the film attempts to emphasize Kong's human-ness.As far as comparisons to the original film and the 2005 version, if we're honest about it this '76 version, albeit flawed, is better or just as good in many areas. Although the original is a masterpiece considering its era, it has quite a few obvious flaws aside from its datedness, e.g. Jack's premature declaration of love for Ann, the blandness of the characters (except Fay), the natives' kidnapping of Ann (Why sure!) and the goofy appearance of Kong himself (all the dinosaurs look great but they couldn't come up with a better, more authentic look for the film's star monster, even though they had apes in zoos to compare with?). As for the 2005 version, it's a fun film but seriously marred by cartooney overkill. It plays out like a Road Runner cartoon more than anything else. It's just impossible to suspend disbelief while watching it.So what's good about this '76 version? - The film has a serious vibe of high adventure. The ship scenes and the initial island sequences with the tribe are great. Take, for instance, when they discover the great wall, ominous music and all.- The score by John Barry is exceptional.- The three main characters are both memorable and likable -- Jack (Jeff Bridges), Dwan (Jessica Lange) and Fred Wilson (Charles Grodin). Bridges in particular makes a distinctive long-haired protagonist. This wasn't the case in the original. Although Fay Wray was fine, the two male leads are bland and forgettable. Even though Fred (Grodin) is a greedy opportunist in this '76 version he's still kinda likable. For instance, he could have kept Jack locked up the entire trip but chooses to give him a job instead. Also, he could have tried to hog all the profits from Kong's capture but shares the 'success' with others, including Dwan and Jack (even though Jack ultimately declines).- The film's worth watching just to catch Jessica in her curvy physical prime. The scenes of her after their initial arrival to the mysterious island are unforgettable! Lange is dressed in skimpy jean shorts and a striped billy shirt and she's just incredible. No wonder Kong became fascinated with her.- The Kaua'i, Hawaii, locations are magnificent! The other two versions don't hold a candle to these breathtaking locations, including Jackson's cartooney CGI jungles.- Kong looks best in this version. Yes, it's just a guy in an ape suit but it works. His facial expressions are great. Kong looks so much better in this version compared to the original that there really is no comparison. Of course, Kong looks great in the 2005 remake as well, but Jackson basically just made Kong out to be a gargantuan gorilla. By contrast, in the original and '76 version Kong is a huge ape with human qualities. I prefer the huge human-like ape over the (mere) giant gorilla.- This version is more adult-oriented and believable. Skull Island is a mysterious island with large animals but no dinosaurs. This makes more sense. The thrilling dino-scenes have been omitted in favor of sequences of a more dramatic nature. I prefer the thrilling dino-encounters but have to respect the risk-taking originality and believability of this version.- This is the only version that shows Kong being transported from the island to the U.S.A. Quite a bit of runtime is devoted to it, in fact.- The World Trade Center (RIP) is featured and the ending is pretty gory; you can't help but sympathize with Kong.WHAT DOESN'T WORK - The giant ape hand\/arm gets the job done but that's about it. It's used too often and moves too slow.- Likewise, the giant snake is okay but that's about it. This sequence required a thrilling battle between two colossal creatures and what we get is pretty weak and forgettable.- The studio sets for the island look fake; they're not much better than the sets seen on the original Star Trek TV series.

It sticks closely to the traditional story. Robin is a dispossessed Saxon nobleman, the Earl of Locksley, during the reign of Richard the Lionheart. Richard is being held prisoner by his enemy Leopold of Austria, and his brother Prince John has usurped power in England and is plotting to usurp the throne. Robin leads a rebel army against the tyrannical John and against the corrupt Norman barons who are oppressing the Saxon commoners by imposing heavy taxes on them. A subplot deals with Robin's romance with Maid Marian and his enmity with the wicked Sir Guy of Gisbourne, a prominent supporter of John and his rival for Marian's hand. Filmed versions of the Robin Hood story often reflect the periods in which they were made. The Richard Greene television version from the fifties reflected the patriotic sentiments widespread in a decade when many Britons were talking about a New Elizabethan Age. Richard Lester's Robin and Marian from 1976 was a dull, pessimistic film for the dull, pessimistic seventies. Kevin Costner's Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, made in a more optimistic period following the end of the Cold War, restored something of the swashbuckling glamour to the story but, in keeping with nineties political correctness, introduced a prominent black character. The recent Russell Crowe version gives us a grittier, more egalitarian Robin, no longer an earl or a knight but a man of the common people.The Adventures of Robin Hood was made in 1938, only a year before the outbreak of war, when Europe was confronted by the menace of Fascism, and clearly reflects many of the concerns of those days. Robin and his men stand against both tyranny and racism. Although they are fighting for the rights of the oppressed Saxon peasantry, they do not hate the Normans. (It's injustice, not Normans that I hate, says Robin). They are not fighting to reverse the Norman Conquest, to restore a Saxon to the throne or to expel the Normans from England. Rather, they recognise Richard as their rightful King and dream of a future in which Normans and Saxons can live in peace together with equal rights. Despite this stress on the Rights of Man, however, the scriptwriters may have thrown a sop to that influential lobby which wanted America to keep out of foreign wars; towards the end Richard makes a speech regretting his involvement in the Crusades and promising that in future he will devote all his energies to his own country. The continuing appeal of this film, however, has nothing to do with its relevance to thirties politics and a lot to do with the dash and style with which it was made. It was shot in Technicolor, still very much an innovation in 1938 even for swashbuckling adventure stories. It starred in the leading role Errol Flynn, probably the most charismatic adventure hero of the period, who gave one of the most perfectly judged performances of his career. Flynn's leading lady was (as so often was the case) the lovely Olivia de Havilland; this was the third of eight films they were eventually to make together. The director Michael Curtiz was to direct Flynn and de Havilland in another film, Dodge City, the following year. The film gives us not one but three memorable villains, all carefully differentiated from one another. Claude Rains plays the smooth, scheming Prince John, Melville Cooper provides comic relief as the cowardly, inept Sheriff of Nottingham and Basil Rathbone almost eclipses Flynn as Gisbourne, a man whose aristocratic demeanour barely conceals the fact that he is really no more than a crude thug. His final, justly famous, swordfight with Robin provides the great climax to the film. The swordfight is one of a number of great action sequences- others include the archery tournament and the scene where the Merry Men ambush Gisbourne's party transporting tax money through Sherwood Forest. (And Sherwood does look convincingly like an English woodland, something which was not always the case during this period in Hollywood films supposedly set in England. The rural scenes in another Flynn movie from the following year, The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex, were all too obviously shot in that corner of England which is forever California). Flynn was one of those actors who had a fairly small range but could give some excellent performances if he remained within that range. (In Elizabeth and Essex, for example, he was perhaps straying a bit too far from his comfort zone). As a swashbuckling hero he had never been surpassed and never, really, even been equalled. (Tyrone Power and Stewart Granger have perhaps come the closest; Burt Lancaster's efforts in the genre, like The Flame and the Arrow and The Crimson Pirate do not really measure up). The Adventures of Robin Hood is perhaps the best swashbuckler ever made. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"13 March 2014","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The legend of Robin Hood has been filmed many times, but probably remains the best-known version, despite the fact that it was made nearly three quarters of a century ago.

The recent Russell Crowe version gives us a grittier, more egalitarian Robin, no longer an earl or a knight but a man of the common people.The Adventures of Robin Hood was made in 1938, only a year before the outbreak of war, when Europe was confronted by the menace of Fascism, and clearly reflects many of the concerns of those days. Robin and his men stand against both tyranny and racism. Although they are fighting for the rights of the oppressed Saxon peasantry, they do not hate the Normans. (It's injustice, not Normans that I hate, says Robin). They are not fighting to reverse the Norman Conquest, to restore a Saxon to the throne or to expel the Normans from England. Rather, they recognise Richard as their rightful King and dream of a future in which Normans and Saxons can live in peace together with equal rights. Despite this stress on the Rights of Man, however, the scriptwriters may have thrown a sop to that influential lobby which wanted America to keep out of foreign wars; towards the end Richard makes a speech regretting his involvement in the Crusades and promising that in future he will devote all his energies to his own country. The continuing appeal of this film, however, has nothing to do with its relevance to thirties politics and a lot to do with the dash and style with which it was made. It was shot in Technicolor, still very much an innovation in 1938 even for swashbuckling adventure stories. It starred in the leading role Errol Flynn, probably the most charismatic adventure hero of the period, who gave one of the most perfectly judged performances of his career. Flynn's leading lady was (as so often was the case) the lovely Olivia de Havilland; this was the third of eight films they were eventually to make together. The director Michael Curtiz was to direct Flynn and de Havilland in another film, Dodge City, the following year. The film gives us not one but three memorable villains, all carefully differentiated from one another. Claude Rains plays the smooth, scheming Prince John, Melville Cooper provides comic relief as the cowardly, inept Sheriff of Nottingham and Basil Rathbone almost eclipses Flynn as Gisbourne, a man whose aristocratic demeanour barely conceals the fact that he is really no more than a crude thug. His final, justly famous, swordfight with Robin provides the great climax to the film. The swordfight is one of a number of great action sequences- others include the archery tournament and the scene where the Merry Men ambush Gisbourne's party transporting tax money through Sherwood Forest. (And Sherwood does look convincingly like an English woodland, something which was not always the case during this period in Hollywood films supposedly set in England. The rural scenes in another Flynn movie from the following year, The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex, were all too obviously shot in that corner of England which is forever California). Flynn was one of those actors who had a fairly small range but could give some excellent performances if he remained within that range. (In Elizabeth and Essex, for example, he was perhaps straying a bit too far from his comfort zone). As a swashbuckling hero he had never been surpassed and never, really, even been equalled. (Tyrone Power and Stewart Granger have perhaps come the closest; Burt Lancaster's efforts in the genre, like The Flame and the Arrow and The Crimson Pirate do not really measure up). The Adventures of Robin Hood is perhaps the best swashbuckler ever made. 9\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure"},{"date":"13 March 2014","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The legend of Robin Hood has been filmed many times, but probably remains the best-known version, despite the fact that it was made nearly three quarters of a century ago. It sticks closely to the traditional story. Robin is a dispossessed Saxon nobleman, the Earl of Locksley, during the reign of Richard the Lionheart. Richard is being held prisoner by his enemy Leopold of Austria, and his brother Prince John has usurped power in England and is plotting to usurp the throne. Robin leads a rebel army against the tyrannical John and against the corrupt Norman barons who are oppressing the Saxon commoners by imposing heavy taxes on them. A subplot deals with Robin's romance with Maid Marian and his enmity with the wicked Sir Guy of Gisbourne, a prominent supporter of John and his rival for Marian's hand. Filmed versions of the Robin Hood story often reflect the periods in which they were made. The Richard Greene television version from the fifties reflected the patriotic sentiments widespread in a decade when many Britons were talking about a New Elizabethan Age.

You'll even hear Jaws-imitation suspense music as the creature approaches and attacks.THE PLOT A baby alligator is flushed down the toilet and mutates to great size from eating chemically contaminated dog carcasses in the sewers. A policeman and a beautiful reptile expert team up to kill the beast after it starts eating people.Alligator barely runs 90 minutes and is kind of boring for the first half hour, but the last hour perks up and keeps your attention. Unlike Jaws, which is completely serious and scary, most adults won't take Alligator too seriously or find it remotely scary. In fact, I busted out laughing numerous times when the creature would attack people. Some understandably compare Alligator to Piranha, which came out two years earlier in 1978, but Piranha takes itself a bit more seriously and is more entertaining overall. Actually, as far as creatures-on-the-loose flicks go, Piranha is a definite 5\/5 Star piece.What makes Alligator a necessary purchase is the awe-inspiringly gorgeous redhead Robin Riker, who doesn't appear until half an hour into the story. After that she's featured prominently. Robin was 28 years old at the time of release but possesses such a mature and classy air (I mean that in a good way, of course) that she seems at least 35.Since the last hour of Alligator is worthwhile and fun I'll rate the story 3.5\/5 Stars, even though it can't be taken seriously. Robin Riker, on the other hand, rates 5\/5 Stars (actually there aren't enough stars in the universe!); hence, my overall 4\/5 Star rating.Men join in with me Robin Riker, Robin Riker, Robin Riker, Robin Riker, Robin Riker, Robin Riker, Robin Riker (continue ad nauseam).

A group of terrorist thugs come aboard and take over the ship. They purpose to steal the ship's nuclear missiles. There's one problem Ryback is loose on the ship and he's a professional killing machine, a veritable one-man-army.It takes about 25-minutes for the story to set up, and then the action kicks in. From there it's Ryback v.s. the thugs all the way to the end. The film runs 1 hour and 38 minutes before the credits roll.A few notables -- Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey are truly exceptional as the psychotic villains.-- Steven Seagal is perfect and even likable as the Rambo-like hero. The sequel Under Siege 2 Dark Territory takes place on a train, and it's a good one-man-army flick as well, but not as good as this one. Anyway, I've only seen a handful of Seagal films and Under Siege is by far his best.-- Erika Eleniak co-stars as the playboy bunny who came aboard to entertain during the big party. She has a notorious pop-out-of-the-cake scene where she's wearing very little clothing. Aside from this brief scene she appears fully clothed throughout the entire picture. Anyway, this infamous cake scene has become quite the running joke between me, my wife, my brother-in-law and sister. Generally speaking, red-blooded males will cherish the scene (their carnal side, that is) whereas wives and girlfriends will hate it or, at least, dismiss it with a role of the eyes. It's all in good fun, but I wouldn't let the kiddies see it.-- The entire film is confined to a battleship at sea, which makes it almost claustrophobic. So don't watch Under Siege if you're in the mood for picturesque landscapes (like, say, First Blood).-- While seeing the film it dawned on me how knowledgeable the screenwriter(s) must have been about all-things military. A truly exceptional job.-- I was also impressed with the directing, cinematography and editing. Such things usually don't occur to me while watching films, so it has to be pretty outstanding for me to notice. Needless to say, this is, technically speaking, a first-rate picture.So why not a higher rating?
