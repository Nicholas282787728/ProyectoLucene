I have seen a lot of his movies (Lone Star is my favorite and gets my highest recommendation if you haven't already seen it) but he remained sort of a cipher as a moviemaker to me up until now.  His casts are always so huge and impressive, true ensembles. He usually tackles trying to capture a place and the feeling and tensions within those places (sometimes he does this with an era, as he did with the late 1910's in Eight Men Out).  And sometimes, some of his actors, plot devices, and filmmaker's twists and turns seem so contrived and nearly phony.  What I've figured out about Sayles is this  he is essentially making melodramas, movie soap operas that are elevated above the daytime television trash by consistently strong acting, careful and well-planned interweaving of plot lines, and a sharp sense of atmosphere.Sunshine State is one of Sayles' most unabashedly melodramatic works, and, as a result, one of his strongest.  He finally seems to submit to his melodramatic tendencies that made some of his other films, like City of Hope and at points Limbo, seem ludicrously unreal.  The story is many-pronged. In the Florida resort town of Plantation Island, there are two disparate communities  Verona Beach is the white seacoast town and Lincoln Beach is its black cousin across the island, a throwback to the segregationist South. Both towns are in varying states of economic despair and cultural disintegration, and are equally at the mercy of wealthy land developers who want to gobble up the area to bulldoze the island.  The parallel structure that Sayles employs is not new to him (he talked about both the Mexicans and the Texans, and their interrelationships, in Lone Star to similar effect) and he extends it here to tell the stories of two families, one white and one black.Marly Temple (Edie Falco) unhappily operates her family's Sea-Vue motel and greasy spoon seafood restaurant after her father Furman (Ralph Waite) loses his sight and falls ill (the mother, played by Jane Alexander, is a dotty community theatre doyenne and greyhound activist).  Developers want to take the run-down land from the Temples, with its prime beachfront property and convert it to a tropical paradise of retail shops.  The company, represented by landscape designer Timothy Hutton, and golf-playing overlord Alan King, infiltrates the lives of the town's denizens throughout the movies.  On the flip-side is the black community, similarly falling prey to developers. Desiree Perry (Angela Bassett) returns home to visit her mother Eunice (Mary Alice) with her new husband, a gentrified anesthesiologist from the North (James McDaniel) in tow.  There are skeletons in each family's closet and the specter of segregation and racism hangs over it all, but now they face a common foe in the land developers.Sayles' greatest asset has always been his casts and his creation of characters for those casts, and Sunshine State is a foremost example of that strength.  Great character actors like Bill Cobbs, as the Lincoln Beach legend who leads anti-development protests, Mary Steenburgen, as the overeager planner of the town's Buccaneer Days, and Gordon Clapp as her suicidal husband, are all on the periphery of the story.  As with any ensemble picture, and Sunshine State is one in every sense of the word, there are standouts.  Here in particular, I was drawn to Ralph Waite, totally immersing himself in the anti-Papa Walton, Timothy Hutton, whose screen charisma seems to increase with age, and Edie Falco, once again proving herself as one of the strongest, most independent actresses working today on big and little screens (and I say that without ever seeing The Sopranos).  But commendations are deserved all around the cast.  Sayles too has created a mood in which his character sketches flourish, and his talented actors just run away with them.To return to the notion of Sayles' movies as melodramas  they all have a contrived feeling, as if the audience can map out the various twists and turns and figure out the character connections before they are made clear onscreen.  There is greater epiphany in the self-discovery and when the thing actually happens that the audience suspected all along, it is inconsequential.  In some of Sayles' films, I think that this is a detriment; in Sunshine State, I think it only helps bring the story into the consciousness of the viewer.  By engaging the audience proactively, Sayles gives his seemingly clichéd situations and connections emotional gravity. Everything now seems to have a purpose even if you figure out that purpose long before Sayles does.  This way, he achieves a sort of milieu, a sense of time and place and people, that exist long before the movie starts, and will continue exists long after the final shot (which is comically ingenious). The melodrama is too engaging to be hokey and too real to be ludicrous, and that is what saves Sayles.
