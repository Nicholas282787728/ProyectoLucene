It is the fact that the characters are portrayed as so stupid that makes the message so powerful, alongside the pessimistic ending of the film.

There is most certainly no other film like it and to attempt to make a film with such serious issues and film it as a farce is obviously a difficult thing to do successfully.

He stays with a family who legend says, has the vampire trapped in a tomb in the basement. After a séance the vampire appears and then it becomes a question of how do you put the evil back into the box.Thats a poor description for a very moody, very good rethink of the vampire legend. In theory this is a modern day sequel to Werner Herzog's remake of the FW Murnau's silent original. However other than the fact that Klaus Kinski plays the vampire the films are pretty much separate films. Here the vampire is a force outside of nature, he goes out during the day, religious objects don't affect him and he has powers beyond those of normal vampires. To be honest this film's idea of vampires and their creation is very different than what is considered normal vampire lore.This is a film thats a bit more form over content, but its still weaves a magical spell. Its a very atmospheric haunted Venice story where mood and feeling is all. Its a film designed to make you feel creepy and uneasy and not so much scary in the jump and scream variety. It helps that the film rethinks what a vampire is. Going back to folklore where things other than a bite on the neck was required to turn someone undead, this film keeps you off balance since you can't be sure what is real with in the film's world. Adding a great deal to the film are the performances of the excellent cast.

Armed with cameras and microphones, they are the eyes and ears of the West through the daily news. Among them is serious British journalist Michael Henderson and the more flamboyant American Flynn. While the latter is concerned with his ratings and manages to stay relaxed with all the violence around him, the former becomes tied up with the plight of the children in an orphanage on the front line and loses his distance from the story as he tries to force someone, anyone, to get the children out of the war zone.The film opens with a scene that sums the evil nature of the Bosnia conflict up perfectly when one of a wedding party is picked off by a sniper. It is an impacting way to open a film and the script more or less maintains this across the film in one way or another. The plot is hardly anything too original as mostly it relies on Henderson getting personally involved in his story to provide a narrative frame for the conflict but the film uses it well. Winterbottom was a good choice for director because he doesn't over-egg the emotion or push the narrative beyond what it can cope with. Instead he uses it well to tell one story without ever losing sight of the fact that it is just one story among millions. This worked well for me as I found the bigger picture to be the more engaging side of the film but appreciated the structure given the subject by the narrative; this way it remains impacting on a political level while also looking at the personal, human level.With the time the relevance of the film will fade as the conflict becomes something in the past &#150; I don't mean this coldly but just suggest that something fresh in our collective memories will be of more relevant than something in the past. The film retains its impact because it does shown more than the news showed but what I found more distressing was the fact that the same attacks on the media and our politicians could be launched about many conflicts since. Welcome to Dafour, Rwanda, Iraq &#150; take your pick. How many times do we see our leaders quibble over the legal definition of genocide while the news footage shows us images of corpses and the suffering of civilians? Winterbottom uses news footage within his material to good effect to highlight the stupidity and hypocrisy of the world leaders in the face of such horror and few viewers will take too much issue with the lack of balance in this regard; it is a strength of the film that these points are still valid but I truly wish that they weren't.The cast take to this serious material well and produce some solid performances while also knowing their place within the bigger picture and not showboating or overdoing things. Dillane is the best example of this as he is technically the lead character but yet holds back and shows restraint to the point of keeping his story from dominating the film &#150; it is a good show and Winterbottom also deserves credit for helping him produce this. Looking at it cynically, Harrelson and Tomei were added to sell the film and this is mostly what they do; however both are solid albeit in smaller roles than some viewers will expect. Nesbitt, Fox, Visnjic and Nusevic all produce solid support and more than stand up alongside Dillane's lead. The most important delivery is that of the conflict itself and Winterbottom does that well. Some viewers have bemoaned the lack of context or explanation of the conflict but to me this was a good call because what matters is that civilians were slaughtered and suffering, when this is the case what does it matter what the reasons for it are? Overall then a solid and impacting film. It doesn't have the most balance in the world but it is well worth a watch for what it does well and, sadly, the continuing relevance in current conflicts around the world today.

Shortly before he heads off for his vacation he agrees to take on a patient from another doctor and meets with Bob Wiley. He hands Bob a copy of his book, Baby Steps and ushers him out. However he has no idea how needy Bob is and it isn't long before Bob is calling Dr Marvin's service trying to get in touch with him by any means necessary. When this fails Bob manages to find the Marvins' address and turn up unannounced. When the rest of his family take to Bob, Leo finds he is stuck with him while the TV interview gets closer.Just in case you are in any doubt about where this very obvious comedy is going let me just say that I might not be able to avoid spoiling this for you. I have put a spoiler warning on the review but to me nothing I'm saying cannot be foreseen by any casual viewer after only 10 minutes of running time. Suffice to say that Bob endears himself into the family and teaches Leo himself lessons in life. The narrative flow provides nothing of surprise or particular interest along the road to the obvious and it is hard to really get engaging in it due to the total lack of spark or wit in the script. The delivery itself feels very safe, very middle-of-the-road but for constantly aiming for the safe middle the film winds up being pretty dull and lacking in anything that is that funny or sharp. Sure, it is amusing enough if this is what you want but I couldn't help feeling that it was just plodding along with very ho-hum material.So far so what, but what annoyed me somewhat was the waste of the talented two leads. At one or two points Dreyfuss and Murray work really well off one another but for the majority they are working with average characters and average material. They deliver with energy and talent but generally the tools aren't there for them to do anything that special even if I did appreciate their efforts.

Suffice to say that Bob endears himself into the family and teaches Leo himself lessons in life. The narrative flow provides nothing of surprise or particular interest along the road to the obvious and it is hard to really get engaging in it due to the total lack of spark or wit in the script. The delivery itself feels very safe, very middle-of-the-road but for constantly aiming for the safe middle the film winds up being pretty dull and lacking in anything that is that funny or sharp. Sure, it is amusing enough if this is what you want but I couldn't help feeling that it was just plodding along with very ho-hum material.So far so what, but what annoyed me somewhat was the waste of the talented two leads. At one or two points Dreyfuss and Murray work really well off one another but for the majority they are working with average characters and average material. They deliver with energy and talent but generally the tools aren't there for them to do anything that special even if I did appreciate their efforts. The support cast are somehow cast at the tvm level even if they do a so-so job. When the only other face you recognise after the lead two is Airplane's Julie Hagerty then you know you are in the sh1t &#150; beyond her the only person I knew was a guy from Oz as the TV show director.Overall then a very middle-of-the-road comedy that lacks anything that sharp, interesting or funny. I wanted it to be more than it was. The two lead actors also want that too but, despite trying really hard, the material just isn't there for them and the support cast aren't able to do anything to help them out. A very so-so comedy but it might distract if you are in a relaxed mood.

The material spans decades and follows characters in and around the porn industry at the time. Although it is set in the porn industry and will require the audience to be tolerant of the same, the story is more about the characters than any specific story. This is not to say that its strength is in its depth because this doesn't offer an insight into the bowels of the porn industry and how it affects people. Naturally the whole thing is very much a cautionary tale but this is not the same as having depth. This may seem like a criticism but in reality the film survives with the depth it has as aims for a sweep of the eras.In this regard it succeeds because the feel of the period is really well done and the overall delivery is strong. At times it does feel like Anderson has raided Scorsese's playbook (especially in regards the soundtrack and the use of long tracking shots) but generally it is impressive. Visually the film is high energy and the soundtrack barely has a bum note in it. Where Anderson has really landed on his feet is his cast because few directors get a line-up this impressive so early in their career. Wahlberg is good although he is helped by the fact that the material jumps from Eddie to Dirk with the jump between decades; this way Wahlberg doesn't have to blend his character so much as make a step change (which in fairness he does do well). Reynolds may have been so clueless that he disowned the film before embracing his awards but he is very good in his supporting role &#150; probably better than he has been for years (although that is not saying much). The depth of the cast is a real strength. Moore is impressive as always with her character varying between confidence and damaged goods, she is real and convincing. Graham has less to work with but is still good while Reilly, Cheadle, Guzmán, Hoffman, Macy, Hall and others all deliver the type of quality that we have come to expect from them.Overall then a very enjoyable film whose lack of depth in the cautionary morality tale is covered by a really good delivery from Anderson and his talented cast.

The soundtrack is also really good and works well within the film, never hitting a bum note and always lifting the energy anytime any track plays. The plot is well written in regards the funny dialogue and the slick narrative but those who worry about films making violence and crime look cool should probably just avoid it because this is what it does in the place of substance or moral consideration.

The title characters have all been seriously hurt in the process of living and are searching (consciously and unconsciously) for ways to cope with what has happened to them in the past. To the extent that they represent an almost universal condition, the film is an allegorical study, with each character meant to illustrate a different means of coping with the realization of ones growing irrelevancy. The film, perhaps more perfect because of its flaws, should remind viewers of Unforgiven, Ride the High Country, and Cutter's Way. Arthur Miller's script is a good one, but it is John Huston's direction that transforms good into great. In part from his inspired casting and in part from his ability to draw career best serious performances from his four stars. The initial setting is Reno, symbolically appropriate because as the quickie divorce capital, it is a place where people try to scrap off the excess baggage of their pasts. Roslyn (Marilyn Monroe) has come there for this purpose and her new freedom is a beacon to her three male co-stars. Her beauty and childlike innocence is a catalyst for the three because she tangibly represents a future that all feel will slip away from them without her. All three of the men are essentially dead, a condition that Roslyn finally grasps toward the end of the film. The Roslyn character never entirely comes into focus, and Monroe is actually shot in soft-focus; intentionally contrasting with the sharp focus of the others.There is not a great deal of conflict between the characters, mostly they are fighting their own internal battles.A mechanic, Guido (Eli Wallach), wants to possess her as a way to rekindle his dream of domestic bliss, which was destroyed when his wife died. A WWII pilot who flies an old biplane, Guido still owes a half-finished house in the country; its construction (and the forward progress of his life) stopped with the death of his wife. Guido copes by living in the distant past (symbolized by his ancient tattered biplane), complaining about the unjust recent past, and scheming (not dreaming) about the future. Late in the film Wallach's character undergoes an abrupt and inconsistent transition. This is the film's one major flaw and may have resulted from Monroe's fear that Wallach's character as originally scripted would over shadow hers.Perce (Montgomery Clift) is a relatively young rodeo rider who has been kicked in the head a few too many times. His idyllic childhood was shattered by the death of his father and his mother's remarriage. Deprived of his destiny by these events, he copes by dulling his senses with bruises, concussions, and alcohol. He is too sensitive when clear-headed to deal with reality of the outside world. Gay (Clark Gable) is an old-time cowboy who is estranged from his wife and family. Unable to control that situation he is determined to retain control of himself, vowing to remain independent and not work for wages. He wants to possess and control Roslyn as well.Eventually the four characters set out on a venture to round up wild Mustangs and sell them to a dog food manufacturer. Out on the isolated range the four characters face their own demons and each other. Mustanging (essentially misfit humans rounding up misfit horses) was once a romantic adventure, but what seemed OK when the wild horses were numerous seems cruel and pathetic given their diminished number. And it is clearly not a self-sustaining venture as even Guy realizes that the depleted herds offer no future to the cowhand wishing to remain independent.The climatic scene has Guy struggling to subdue a wild stallion, which symbolically represents the world that has changed out from under him.

Although his pep talks were generally scathing and peppered with swear words, which could have been replaced with a more menacing and meaningful performance. The odd push and shove and bad words here and there didn't convey that it was a place not for the fainthearted, it's a tougher in any restaurant kitchen you care to mention! I found the music\/montage scenes awkward, with a little flurry of jump cuts that only appeared briefly and upset the flow of the film for me.The whole story was played out in too simplistic a way.

The film took home four Oscars, but that hardly seems enough. Unforgiven is a film that shows us a different perspective of the Old West. In this film, good and bad are not easy to pick out. The characters we identify with the most have done every bit as much wrong in their lives as those they find themselves shooting at. This film may take a different perspective, but it still allows the genre to maintain its dignity. That is the mark of great film-making. That is the mark of Clint Eastwood.Eastwood plays a retired gunfighter named Will Munny. It has been 11 years, he tells us, since the last time he shot at a man. His departed wife apparently tried to make a decent enough man out of him that he doesn't drink, cuss, or have any reason to resort to violence any more. He runs a tiny pig farm in Kansas, but his reputation is still known as far away as Texas, from what we are told. One day, a cocky young man rides up to Munny and tries to recruit him for a bounty hunting job in Wyoming. It seems two ornery cowboys have cut up the face of a prostitute, and her fellow whores are offering $1000 for anyone who would kill them. Munny tells the kid he doesn't do that kind of thing any more, but he badly needs the cash. After briefly deliberating on the matter, Munny recruits an old partner (Morgan Freeman) and the two of them ride off with the kid to collect that reward. Trouble is, the town where they're headed has a nasty sheriff (Gene Hackman), and he knows there will be assassins coming for the reward. He wants no part of bounty hunters riding through his turf. The conflict between the sheriff and Munny is unavoidable. For most of the film, Munny and his pals hardly seem up to the task, until the sheriff takes things a bit too far.The film is absolutely astounding in its narrative and cinematography. The story gives us one gut-wrenching scene after another with the beautiful backdrop of Western North America behind them. We learn just how difficult it really is for supposedly tough men to draw their pistols and accurately fire at someone else. We wonder about the motivation behind Eastwood and Freeman's characters. Do they really need the cash that bad, or do they really still have murder in their souls after all these years? We find out just who does and who doesn't as the action unfolds. Not only are the lead performances great, but so are the supporting roles. Gene Hackman won as Oscar for his turn as Little Bill Dagget. He's just as good as he always is, but it's great to see the Academy finally reward talented people like that. The late Richard Harris, at Eastwood's request, also turns in a very memorable performance. No film since Barry Lyndon has had better cinematography.Toward the end, when Eastwood stares down an entire saloon of would-be toughs with a double-barrel shotgun, we get perhaps the scene he will be remembered for more than any other. The glint in his eyes peering out from under that hat... the glow from the torches outside... the tone in his voice... Absolutely haunting.This film is not to be missed.10 of 10 stars from the Hound.

If you've seen any of John Waters' earlier films, then this movie is a major shock because in so many ways this movie seems very,....normal and even uplifting!! This, coming from the same director was delighted in nauseating his audiences or shocking their sensibilities!! HAIRSPRAY, despite being funny and unusual in many ways, is actually a very family-friendly and endearing film! These are certainly NOT the sort of things I thought I'd say about a Waters film. I like his offensive and mondo-bizarro-type films, but after viewing HAIRSPRAY I realize that I like the direction this film took. Sure, it's extremely sentimental and nice, but the film is so dog-done fun and has such a decent central message that it's something I highly recommend to the kids! Surely this CAN'T be the same John Waters who produced the X-Rated FEMALE TROUBLE!! Well, believe it or not, it is and Waters has actually gone mainstream! Wow,...next I'll see pigs fly! I initially avoided this movie because I had seen a few small glimpses of it and thought it looked too tame and a trifle boring. However, I am so glad I forced myself to try it again. The film has absolutely everything going for it--infectious music, a great style and love of the time period, a lot of great laughs, a strong socially-conscious message and a lot of characters you can't help but love.The most shocking thing about the film to me, though, was that Divine played a very wonderful and touching mother! Despite his\/her great size, she loved her daughter, Tracy, and her husband and seemed like a pretty typical housewife--despite actually being a guy in drag. Divine also played a male role as an ultra-racist jerk and it was fun seeing him in dual roles (which he also did in FEMALE TROUBLE when he made love to the female version of himself, believe it or not).Ricki Lake played one of the more wonderful characters of a teen I have ever seen. Despite being very overweight, she was the type of kid I would love to have as a daughter--being very self-confident and decent through and through. It was also great seeing the plus-size Lake dancing very credibly in the film. In fact, I loved her dancing and the songs--you can't help but snap your fingers and enjoy them. What I particularly liked about her character was that Tracy knew she was fat but didn't care, and as a result, those around her accepted her. In particular, the cutest guy in the film fell for her and could look beyond her weight. I know this isn't exactly like real-life, but it's sure how I wish life was and it is so great to see a non-neurotic fat and happy girl on film. All too often, they are either ignored completely (such as the unwritten no one above a size 6 allowed on the film rule), or shown as pathetic or tortured (like in the excessively pointless and cruel French film, FAT GIRL).Since it really is a John Waters film, despite all the nice and wonderful things, there are also the usual strange supporting characters as well. The best examples are Ric Ocasek (lead singer from The Cars) and Pia Zadora as the drugged-out beatnik couple that have very little to do with the movie's plot. But there are also appearances by Debbie Harry (from Blondie), Jerry Stiller, Sonny Bono and a few others who bounce in and out of the film. Strange casting, by the way is THE one constant in all Waters films.Now for the plot, despite the whole emphasis on huge hair and doo-wop music, there is actually a deeper story that has substance. Ricki Lake (Tracy) has just become a regular on a local dance show (similar to American Bandstand, but set in Baltimore). She's an instant local celebrity and adored, but despite this, she cannot ignore that Black people are never allowed on the show with White kids--even though the music all has roots in the African-American culture. When her dippy friend (Penny) begins dating a nice Black man, Tracy cannot just ignore the segregation even though it would have been the safest thing for her to do in the early 60s where the movie is to have taken place.This leads to perhaps the funniest portion of the movie. Although there is a strong message of tolerance and racial togetherness, it is handled in a very funny tongue-in-cheek manner. When Penny and the gang go to a Black neighborhood in Baltimore to learn more about the local dance scene, her mom assumes Penny is going to be murdered! When this hysterical woman chases them into the ghetto and then behaves like she is going to die, it is a laugh riot!!! Every time a Black person comes near her, she assumes she's going to die. When a hobo asks for a quarter, she gives him her purse and begs him not to kill her!!! It's so over-the-top, it's a great way to attack racism caused by ignorance. It gets even better when Waters himself plays a quack psychiatrist that tries to hypnotize and torture Penny into giving up dating a Black man! Despite how it sounds, this is not offensive but subversively funny! Overall, it's rare that I enjoy a movie as much as I liked this one. And when it was over, I felt great--and that makes this a truly special movie.UPDATE I just saw the movie again and, begrudgingly, I must admit that I actually like the remake better. It did seem to have an energy level and polish that made it just a 'hair' better.

His career as a musician isn't going anywhere, and he needs to decide what to do with his life. So he returns to the town where he grew up, under the guise of attending his high school reunion, to decide if he is ready to grow up and move on. Should he give up his dreams, marry his lawyer girlfriend, get a regular job, settle in?This is the premise around which Beautiful Girls revolves. Willie is the central character in a group of twenty-something high school buddies who never left adolescence. They are the quintessential poster boys for abstinence of every stripe. They don't get it. Not just relationships. They don't get anything. They hold down dead end jobs, carry on dysfunctional relationships with women who care about them more than they deserve, and spend quality time together every week fishing in an ice house in the middle of a frozen lake.

His younger brother is in love with her. But he isn't. He never says he loves her at any time, not once. He kisses her briefly once or twice, but there is no passion, no excitement shared between them. There is affection. There is respect. There is friendship. But there is no love, nor the special connection necessary for love to develop. The only time he gets close to her is when they have sex in his room. But sex is not intimacy. Sex is not love. True intimacy defies words. It is transcendental. And that is the beauty that Willie seeks.The final scene provides subtle hints as to what the future holds.

","genre":"Action, Drama, Family"},{"date":"30 October 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Many people have complained that the mix of comedy and tragedy in this movie makes it too uneven to succeed completely. I almost agree, but it's possible that a more traditionally serious, straightforward movie, like the first Whale Frankenstein, might not have had as much impact without the contrast between the intentionally farcical, whimsical scenes, and the overwhelmingly sad scenes. This movie is unlike anything else to come out of old time Hollywood. It seems to be on the verge of becoming a spoof many times, only to stun the viewer with scenes of unbearably moving pathos. The art direction, cinematography, special effects, and of course, music, add up to nothing short of a masterpiece, all skillfully directed through the eccentric vision of James Whale. There is so much to praise in this movie that I will have to mention only a few great moments. SPOILERS AHEADWhen the gossipy, thrill-seeking Frankenstein family maid Minnie (Una O'Connor) turns around to see the hulking, mud-caked, burned Monster staring down at her by the burning ruins of the mill, and she lets out a series of little squeaks and yawps before running away shrieking, as the Monster (Karloff) stares curiously after her. This is followed by one of the funniest moments in all classic films, when the old lady tries to convince a cynical butler at the Frankenstein castle that the Monster is still alive, and he dismisses her as making up stories. Una O'Connor turns and stares directly into the camera ,and says to the audience,  Nobody'll believe me! Well, I wash me hands of it! They can all be murdered in their beds, for all of me! The most famous sequence, gently parodied in Mel Brooks' Young Frankenstein, has the Monster, wounded, terrified and exhausted, finding shelter at the forest cottage of a kindly blind hermit (O.P. Heggie). The scene is delicately balanced between comedy and pathos, as the clumsy, animalistic Monster is contrasted with the quiet, gracious old hermit. The sheer raw emotion of that scene is staggering, from the moment when the hermit and the Monster begin to communicate, and one feels the Monster's desperate, stifled need to reach out and be understood by someone. There is an indescribable beauty in the simple gesture of the hermit tenderly clasping the Monster's hand ,and humbly thanking God for  bringing two of thy lonely children together. The astonishing poignancy of the scene's ending, with the Monster awkwardly, but gently, patting the old hermit on the back ,as the old man breaks down and weeps for joy, is overwhelming. A single tear runs down the Monster's scarred cheek ,and the scene fades out. I have seen this movie with modern audiences more than once, and have never heard anyone laugh at that scene. The audience sat in awed silence, except for a hushed, Wow! from one viewer. The grave robbing scene with Praetorius and his reluctant assistants, his midnight picnic in the tomb, and casual offering of a cocktail to the Monster, the creation of the Bride herself and her unveiling, are all Whale at his best. The last word on this film I leave to Dwight Frye, the original hunchbacked assistant in Frankenstein, and Renfield, Dracula's fly-eating slave. When the coffin is opened, and the three body snatchers look at the skeleton of the young woman to be used in constructing the Bride, there is a pause, and then Frye remarks, in a weaselly rasp,  Pretty little thing in her way, wasn't she? An absolute must for any devotee of classic Thirties horror movies, and possibly James Whale's finest hour.

Decades pass and Sammy has remained in the family home and is now a single mother with an 8 year old, Rudy, while Terry is long gone, drifting with only the occasional postcard to prove to his sister that he is still alive. Terry returns to visit his sister for a while and is taken into her home where he settles in as a friend to Rudy. While he tries to hold himself together, Sammy finds herself with a marriage proposal from a f**k buddy and unwelcome hassle from her petty new boss Brian.Although I know it got awards in the US, I must confess that this film passed me by when it came to the UK as indeed it seemed to do for much of the cinema audience here. I stumbled upon it on a late slot on Film Four recently and decided to give it a go on the basis of what little I knew of it. I am glad I did because it is a quite superior little drama which easily rises above the weaknesses that this type of thing often has. After a slow start the film settles down into the characters really well and draws its strength from there, which is just as well because some of the narrative developments are better than others. Lonergan does well to balance his delivery so he is fair to his characters and doesn't pick on any one of them and never lets comic moments be at the expense of them but more to their enhancement as people on the screen. This is not to say it is perfect and it won't grip those raised on bang-a-minute multiplex action movies but it is effective for what it does.The cast take well to this approach and give good returns on the script. Linney is spot on with a character that could easily have been too forced or conversely been weakly formed. She deals well with the bits that are difficult to swallow and excels with the strengths in her character on the page. She is matched by Ruffalo who never loses sight of the person within his drifter character. Neither of them are totally right or totally wrong and, when they are right it is not always rewarded and when they are wrong it doesn't mean they don't get their way &#150; the script is smart like that. Broderick's is a supporting role and as such has less meat on his bones than the others but he does hit the right notes with his smug, petty manager with problems at home. Culkin is impressive and again delivers a convincing kid rather than the overly cute sh1t that we are often served up with &#150; he gets it right and works really well with Ruffalo as they develop a bigger brother relationship in a convincing manner.Overall then a superior drama that is well written and well acted to deliver an engaging human story that works by avoiding the pitfalls, clichés and weaknesses of other stories within the same sort of vein. Credit to writer and director Lonergan for doing an intelligent job with the story and preventing the narrative weaknesses to become problems. Well worth a look if you like a solid story without aspirations to be anything other than down to earth and natural.

Terry returns to visit his sister for a while and is taken into her home where he settles in as a friend to Rudy. While he tries to hold himself together, Sammy finds herself with a marriage proposal from a f**k buddy and unwelcome hassle from her petty new boss Brian.Although I know it got awards in the US, I must confess that this film passed me by when it came to the UK as indeed it seemed to do for much of the cinema audience here. I stumbled upon it on a late slot on Film Four recently and decided to give it a go on the basis of what little I knew of it. I am glad I did because it is a quite superior little drama which easily rises above the weaknesses that this type of thing often has. After a slow start the film settles down into the characters really well and draws its strength from there, which is just as well because some of the narrative developments are better than others. Lonergan does well to balance his delivery so he is fair to his characters and doesn't pick on any one of them and never lets comic moments be at the expense of them but more to their enhancement as people on the screen. This is not to say it is perfect and it won't grip those raised on bang-a-minute multiplex action movies but it is effective for what it does.The cast take well to this approach and give good returns on the script. Linney is spot on with a character that could easily have been too forced or conversely been weakly formed. She deals well with the bits that are difficult to swallow and excels with the strengths in her character on the page. She is matched by Ruffalo who never loses sight of the person within his drifter character. Neither of them are totally right or totally wrong and, when they are right it is not always rewarded and when they are wrong it doesn't mean they don't get their way &#150; the script is smart like that. Broderick's is a supporting role and as such has less meat on his bones than the others but he does hit the right notes with his smug, petty manager with problems at home. Culkin is impressive and again delivers a convincing kid rather than the overly cute sh1t that we are often served up with &#150; he gets it right and works really well with Ruffalo as they develop a bigger brother relationship in a convincing manner.Overall then a superior drama that is well written and well acted to deliver an engaging human story that works by avoiding the pitfalls, clichés and weaknesses of other stories within the same sort of vein. Credit to writer and director Lonergan for doing an intelligent job with the story and preventing the narrative weaknesses to become problems. Well worth a look if you like a solid story without aspirations to be anything other than down to earth and natural.

Meanwhile on a cab drive, upcoming actress Rose is sharing a limo with lover Lauren, who is confronting her on her suspected infidelity. Meanwhile Alex's wife Emma sees her shrink to discuss dreams and issues within her life. Meanwhile the security guard and receptionist greet those coming to audition for parts and pitch scripts.Those looking for a night in to just veg out and half-watch a movie should probably bail out as the opening titles roll because this is not a film to provide you with the type of entertainment where you can just not pay attention for time. The film has a very disjointed narrative following a collection of characters and it is the type of story that would have been well delivered in a Short Cuts style approach. It isn't perfect but it is interesting enough and has plenty of stuff going on within the script. Ironically the split screen, real time approach (gimmick?) make it selective viewing but also worth a wide audience seeing. It takes a minute to get into the stride of the film and pick up the threads . Specific frames have their volume raised to be audible above the others and this tends to work very well while visually I was still following each frame. While it is fair to call it a gimmick it does make the film worth seeing simply because it is so original an idea (at least as far as I am aware). It does have boring patches and it is certainly not a brilliant film in the traditional sense (the dramatic resolution didn't convince or engage me) but the gimmick does make it worth seeing.Technically the film is impressive because of the long takes and the way the action moves between cameras\/frames in a seamless and it comes off really well. The cast are pretty impressive on paper and you can see why they were all drawn to this challenging experiment. With the nature of the film nobody is really given the opportunity to dominate but considering the difficulty of keeping going with four cameras doing single takes it is impressive that nobody messes up. Burrows wasn't all I would have liked but main turns from Skarsgård, Tripplehorn and Hayek were all good in their characters. The support cast is also strong with solid work from Berkeley, Brooks, Hunter, Huston, MacLachlan, Sands and others.Overall then not a great film but one that is successful on its own terms. The story is engaging even if it becomes forced towards the end but the delivery is the main reason for seeing it. The cast work well with the challenge of working in one take but it is the direction that is more impressive as four cameras work really well together on the one take and it is hard not to be taken in by it on this level. Not great in the traditional sense but well worth seeing for what it does.

People are watching movies for the same reason they listen to music or look at paintings, they wanna feel. We all have to come along with people of different colors, nationalities and whatever. The best and most peaceful way to do that, like it's mentioned in the movie, is to listen to our hearts, which for me is the message that the director and screenplay-writer wanted to bring along. I hope I got the message, on any account it made me cry several times which is a thing not many movies have achieved yet. For me as a German who dealt a lot with the history of his own country and also a little with the history of the Ku-Klux-Clan, it was good to see that those people are shown as just what they are A bunch of mind-sick, dumb and dangerous Nazis. The whole situation in the movie in my opinion stands at the appropriate rate to reality of that time in the south of the United States,what makes it very authentic and traceable. The reason I call it a timeless story although it's certainly set in a special time is that everyone is almost forced to think, at least subconsciously, about the way he or she is dealing with those problems of difference that are always gonna exist. I highly recommend this movie but I will not say enjoy or have fun 'cause you won't find these things in A time to kill. I also love the title 'cause when you think about it, everyone can become a murderer in the right circumstances.

My friend liked Josh Hartnett he took a brilliant part as Zeke Tyler. I didn't know this person but he was great. I also reconised simmular faces. Piper Laurie she played Mrs Karen Olson. I have seen her in other films as well.The films that I've seen her in is Tim,Carrie,Return to Oz, Trauma and this one. But i didn't see her in many parts really but she did well. I also reconised a singer Usher Raymonds. He was great too. The beginning was strange because Robert Pactric who played the coach. One minute he was doing something, he turned around and he was talking to somebody. He said what do u want? Then the alien had got him. And i noticed something about it. I didn't see Mrs Olson get turned into an alien then i saw the rest of them get turned. I thought that it was strange but i thought that when the pupils were saying about shot the ringleader and i thought that Mrs Olson was the ringleader but she wasn't it was a blonde bimbo. And i was puzzled after that. But i thought that it was a fantastic film. I like all of the scenes. When two pupils ran into the Faculty office. They hid in the cupboard and they saw the coach and Mrs Olson and another teacher having a glass of water and second minuter i knew they were turning her into an alien and that was a twist. Then Mrs Olson saw somebody in the cupboard and the coach had opened the door and one pupil had something in his hand and smacked the coach. Then the lass shoved Mrs Olson on the floor and that what made me think that she was the ringleader but my friend and i were wrong. The film had so much action and i will definitely watch that film again. I was surprised that Piper wasn't in many scenes but she was great and she will always be a great actress.I didn't know many actors from the film. The film had many special effects what was great. I cant see any criticisms in that film and also i thought that the film was scary because they was a woman who had died. There was a man who just in the shower and then he heard footsteps. He thought that it was his friend messing about but when he had opened his eyes a woman had ran to him. Her face was awful. She had warned him that they are after everybody in the school. Mrs Olson said that she had cancer and thats what she had died of. At the beginning of the film they were gang of teachers sat near table talking. Mrs Olson acted really friendly and that. She had to go and second minute she saw the coach and he was chasing her and Mrs Olson knocked on the door. She said that she had forgotten something and the teacher was begging for her to open the door quick and second minute i knew. Mrs Olson had killed her. I liked Mrs Olsons glasses that she had on. She looked funny in them. i thought that the film was interesting and it was easy to get into. All of the actors were brilliant and i hope that i see Piper Laurie in more films. I thought that it was a change to see something about Aliens because I've seen Piper in films like Carrie. She had to act like a religious freak who hated Carrie. And i thought that it was a change to see a film whats different.

But Dracula (1931), directed by Tod Browning, and The Mummy (1932), directed by cinematographer Karl Freund, are simply terrible, despite everyone's attempts to remember them as horror classics.Dracula at least had a spooky sense of atmosphere, especially the opening scenes in Dracula's castle and surrounding countryside. The Mummy starts off promisingly enough; there's a chiller of an opening sequence showing Boris Karloff's monster coming to life. But after the story has moved forward in time some ten years, any hopes for an effective, creepy monster movie are doused. No one told me that after waking from the dead, the mummy would don a robe and fez and walk around speaking in a refined British accent! That considerably undermines any frights he may be able to induce. When this mummy wants entry into someone's house, he doesn't come bashing through a wall or creeping through shadowy corridors in the dead of night -- oh no, he rings the doorbell and waits to be admitted like the pizza delivery guy. And Karloff's high-pitched, soft line deliveries, not to mention his slight lisp, don't help matters.This movie is fun to see once for its historical value. Alas, I'm afraid that's all it has to offer.Grade C- ","genre":null},{"date":"30 October 2006","score":"4 out of 12 people found the following review useful","review":" The Universal horror movies of the early 1930s may have been the final word on screen horror at the time, but some of them are so creaky as to be nearly unwatchable today.James Whale knew how to make the most of low budgets, and his unique vision and morbid sense of humour made something truly memorable of his Frankenstein (1931) and The Old Dark House (1932).
