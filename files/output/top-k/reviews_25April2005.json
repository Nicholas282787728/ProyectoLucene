Fast forward to a scene not too long after, and we learn that Max is actually one of the worst students at Rushmore Academy. For while Max is, hands down, the most enthusiastic student at the school, he has difficulty making time for any actual studying. Max is involved in enough extra-curricular activities for a half-dozen students. If he's not directing and performing in one of his over-the-top productions from the seemingly far-from-amateur Max Fischer Players (you'll find a pair of safety glasses and ear some ear plugs underneath your seat...feel free to use them), then he's acting as Russia in the Model U.N., managing the school's La Crosse team, or beekeeping.Then one day, Max's attentions are turned to love whole when he falls for a teacher at his school, and doesn't seem to mind or notice that she's about 15 years too old for him. That's because for Max, nothing appears out of reach. (He plans to apply to Oxford and La Sorbonne, but Harvard is his safety school.) He is unflappable and determined no matter what happens in his life (even when he is eventually expelled from his beloved Rushmore Academy and is forced to go to public school). Max's love interest isn't sure how to handle the situation because at first she finds his interest charming, but then his infatuation becomes, as with everything else in his life, completely over the top. Max simply doesn't understand why she's not attracted to him (Max, you're 15 years old&#133;attraction doesn't enter into it...), and just thinks he needs to try harder to win her.There's not a whole lot of plot to Rushmore, but even if there hadn't been, I think I would have enjoyed just watching the characters interact and do their thing. Jason Schwartzman (and Wes Anderson) have created in Max Fischer one of the more entertaining and original movie characters I've seen in years.But perhaps the best part about this movie is the rockin soundtrack. It simply draws you in. (If you don't already own all of these songs separately, buy the soundtrack.) Anyone who is a fan of Wes Anderson's work must necessarily appreciate his wonderful taste in music, and his talent for matching the perfect song for the moment on screen. Anderson creates what I like to call musical vignettes that one feels compelled to rewind, watch and repeat (well, I always feel compelled). I get the feeling that Anderson personally loves each one of these songs to the point where he can direct a film around them.

A violent, psychotic marauder, Nightrider, had stolen a police Interceptor car and sped down the highway like a complete and total maniac. Main Force Police (MFP) Officers Charlie and Roop zoom after Nightrider in their own Interceptor. They were just tearing up the highway, racing at top speeds. Nightrider and his girlfriend elude Roop and Charlie causing them to crash. They regain control of the car and charge after Nightrider. In a nearby café, MFP Officer Goose gets wind of the pursuit, so he hops on his motorcycle and joins the chase. This time around, Nightrider causes Roop and Charlie to smash right into a van, while another MFP Interceptor drives right through a camper trailer and nearly squashes a toddler. Goose also comes to a crashing halt. Luckily it was mad, bad, MFP Officer Max Rockatansky to the rescue in his turbo-charged Interceptor. He tailgated Nightrider, who tried to elude him and came to a crashing (literally) halt and went out with a bang (also literally). After that, Max went home to his beautiful wife Jessie and their 2-year-old son Sprog. Life on the force was tough, but for Max, it was coming home that made it all worth while.The next day, a gang of motorcycle riding renegade outlaws came to town. These were the meanest, nastiest, most awful people ever to grace the Earth. There was Mudguts, Clunk, Cundalini, Grease Rat, and Bubba. Their leader was the most horrible man around, Son of Satan Himself, Toecutter. They were in town to avenge of the death of Nightrider. Today, they chased a guy and a girl in a Chevy, then they destroyed the car and accosted them for no reason at all. When Max and Goose arrive on the scene, they discover the totally trashed Chevy, the terrified girl and one of the bikers, Johnny the Boy. Johnny is incarcerated, but due to a legal technicality, he is set free. Goose goes berserk while Johnny delighted in taunting him. Goose threatened Johnny who vowed vengeance from Toecutter. And that's just what happened. They sabotaged Goose's motorcycle so when he went for a ride, he was flung right off. When he borrows his friend's truck to go home, they cause him to crash and then, Toecutter and Johnny, abruptly set the truck, with Goose in it, on fire. At the hospital, Max sees Goose's charred corpse and that was about all he could take. He turned in his walking papers to MFP Chief Fifi Macaffee. Max decided that he finally needed a nice, long vacation.Max, Jessie and Sprog drive out to the country in a new Holden Sandman wagon and had the time of their lives. Everything was going great for them. But unfortunately, Toecutter and the gang were still after Max. They tried going after Jessie, but she got away. Later, they found a little surprise from Cundalini on the back of their car; Max, Jessie and Sprog stay at Max's friend Ziggy's farm. His aunt, Mae, looked after them. Max worked on the car while Jessie went to the beach. It wasn't long before the motorcycle gang found them. They attempted to kidnap Sprog and accost Jessie when Mae and her trusty shot gun come to the rescue. She locks Toecutter and the gang in the shed and they made a break for the Sandman. Unfortunately that shed couldn't hold those beasts, so they raced for their bikes. Half way down the road, the Sandman's radiator gave out and so Jessie took Sprog and ran. Toecutter and the gang were beginning to catch up to them. Jessie ran faster but it was too late. Toecutter leaped on her with his bike and smashed her. When Max heard, he was devastated. At the hospital, the child was D.O.A., while all of Jessie's bones and vital organs had been severely damaged beyond repair. They had killed his wife and child! Now, it was personal. Max suited back up in his black leather MFP uniform, commandeered a brand new, souped up V-8 supercharged Interceptor and tore down the highway. When he found those evil bikers, he rammed them right off the road. He managed to gun down Bubba, but Toecutter tried to elude him. But he just didn't see that big rig coming at him...CRASH! Max also made short work of Johnny the Boy before he took off again. Max continued tearing down the highway, looking for evil wherever it may be. For you see, Max had now become the one thing he had always feared he would one day become. The very thing he fought against a terminal crazy. Mad Max. What can I say? It's one mad movie. It's done very well and is very perplexing. Mel Gibson stars as Mad Max Rockatansky. He was relatively unknown at this point, but he would later star in the Lethal Weapon movies and even direct a movie about our Lord Jesus Christ. Also in the cast is Joanne Samuel as Jessie, and boy is she hot! She was quite a cutie. Hugh Keays-Byrne is here as that rotten-to- the-core Toecutter. Steve Bisely is Jim Goose, Roger Ward is Fifi, and Matthew Constantine is that freaky looking toddler that is almost mowed down towards the beginning. Mad Max was followed by two sequels Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior in 1981 and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome in 1985. Both movies are set in post-apocalyptic Australia. The bombs have dropped and there's no more gas. I'll be sure and check them out. Now, Mad Max isn't for everyone, mind you. It's got mild strong language, graphic violence, but the real violence happens off screen, and it's all in all a very weird movie. But if you like those kinds of films, then Mad Max is for you!

It is set in the 22nd Century, when most of the Earth has been turned into a desolate wasteland known as the Cursed Earth and most humans live in highly concentrated cities, walled off from the rest of the world. Society is fairly anarchic, except there for a class of humans, known as judges, who act as cop, judge, jury and executioner all rolled into one. Sylvester Stallone is the titular judge. He's notorious among the other judges, the general citizenry and the other judges for upholding the law in a harsh way. The film primarily tells the story arc from the comics known as The Return of Rico, and concerns a plot to get Dredd into trouble while overthrowing what's left of the existing order.This is a great action\/sci-fi film with a tone reminiscent of Demolition Man (1993), Total Recall (1990), The Fifth Element (1997), Blade Runner (1982) and similar films. If you like Stallone, gloomy futuristic production design and\/or intense action films, Judge Dredd should be a rewarding experience for you, as long as you're not a purist who is coming to the film by way of an intricate familiarity with the 2000 AD comics.The source material caused a slight problem for me, too, but not because I'm a purist. Rather, Judge Dredd suffers a bit from a flaw that plagues many films based on comic books--writers Michael De Luca, William Wisher Jr. and Steven E. de Souza had an extensive, pre-existent mythology (as is necessary when creating a complete, new world) on which to build their work, and they tried to incorporate a bit too much of it. Because of this, we're introduced to a large cast of characters fulfilling functions that we're not familiar with (in the details, at least), and we're regularly faced with new lingo, new cultural concepts, new technology, and so on, often with just a couple lines of dialogue. If you want to understand the details, you really have to pay close attention. But on the other hand, the general arc of the story is relatively simple, and you don't have to know every detail to enjoy it.Given the disposition that Stallone has as Judge Dredd in the film, he may as well have walked out of Kurt Wimmer's film Equilibrium (2002). Dredd initially goes about his business almost robotically; he only cares about enforcing the law. When he's recruited by a higher-up, Chief Justice Fargo (Max von Sydow), to teach ethics (which is quite an ironic idea when you see Dredd's behavior in the opening scene), he tells the students that being a judge basically means giving up one's life to the law. He says that one cannot have friends, for example--never mind that other judges, like Judge Hershey (Diane Lane) try to have social lives outside of work. Dredd later tells Hershey that he did have a friend at one point, but he had to judge him. Sending a friend to prison or killing him (we're not told exactly how Dredd judged him, although we find out later) isn't exactly the best way to encourage a healthy social life.So the subtext of the story, and Dredd's character arc, becomes that through a number of hardships, he finally learns something about ethics for himself--just in time to deal with a potentially shattering bit of information about his personal identity. He ends up accompanied by a man, Herman Ferguson (Rob Schneider, in a role meant primarily as comic relief, although more generously, he's an ironic emotional facilitator), whom he had just judged harshly, even though Ferguson wasn't really doing anything wrong on his first day out of prison. Together they have to go to a figurative hell (The Cursed Earth) to deal with figurative demons (a famed band of rogue cannibals who live in the tough environment) and back again to reach their fulfillment.Like many recent sci-fi stories set in the future, Judge Dredd has a pessimistic view of where technology and social conventions are leading humans. As the story has it, at one point, we had built massive, relatively unstoppable robot warriors, and one of the highlights of the film is when the villain finds one and puts it back into service. It's as much fun to watch the gadgetry as it is to watch the action sequences, and the computer generated landscapes throughout the film are spellbinding, with their sly jabs at various changes and similarities to present locations and cultures. The whole concept of the judges and their hierarchical structure is fascinating, even if some apparent inconsistencies (such as why judges are not summarily dealt with in the same manner that other citizens are) are never explained in the film.The performances are good, even if a few actors barely get enough screen time (like Lane and Joan Chen, who plays semi-villain Ilsa), and the premise is captivating. It's too bad this film gets unduly knocked by purists and those misguidedly looking for detail realism in the genre. Judge Dredd is severely underrated on IMDb.

It is a film about unseen forces controlling us, about speaking out and taking action, rather than sitting back and accepting that what you see is the way the world should be. Featuring many good ideas, minimal and cool dialogue, shady characters and unlikely heroes, They Live is considered by many as Carpenter's last good film, though I have enjoyed most of what he has done since.The film begins with a drifter walking into town, looking for any sort of work. His name is Nada, though this is never said, and he eventually finds work at a building site. There he meets Frank who introduces him to his slum neighbourhood on the outskirts of the city. Pirate TV broadcasts tell of the upper class getting richer, and the middle class being drained. Nada sees that these broadcasts are coming from a nearby church, but is warned not to get involved or the cops will take him away. When one day the church is raided, Nada finds a box of sunglasses. When he wears a pair he begins to see things- advertisements turn to slogans such as 'sleep' and 'obey', and realises that aliens are walking disguised amongst them, mostly the rich people. He grabs a gun and begins killing them, trying to find out why, who, from where etc. He meets Holly who works for a TV station and tries to convince her, but she doesn't believe him and calls the cops. After a long fight Nada manages to give Frank a pair, and he too sees what has been hidden from the public. They find the people who made the glasses, and set out to stop the aliens who are using humans, and other planets as resources for their own wealth.This works as a social commentary on class, wealth, the politics of the time, and as an anti-war message for today. Invasion and subtle control are tolerated until a few rebels realise the truth and fight back. We should not be content with buying what we think makes us look good and become numb and dumb. Roddy Piper of WWF fame gives a fine performance as Nada, and of course his strength is exploited. Keith David is as strong as always, and Foster looks chilling and distant. The effects are still effective even if they do resemble something from the forties, and the story is good. After a slow start things speed up towards a typically Carpenter ending. This is another good film by Carpenter which lacks the best scares of The Thing and the fun of Big Trouble, but still is greatly entertaining and worth watching.8 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 April 2005","score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" Carpenter rounded off his eighties career with They Live, an action and sci-fi mix with all the usual Carpenter traits, but which also works as a propaganda piece, and seems to have influenced films such as The Matrix.

Didi Conn was great in the first movie and this one she was still a cutie, but not the same caliber as before. All of the other characters are well played. The movie's story is not so good but still is entertaining. The songs leave a sexual impression in most scenes but they are still fun hearted. I like this movie for the actors and the music. I do not like the story because it has nothing really to do with Grease one except for brief nuances of certain characters (i.e. Sandie, Her parents and Vince Fontaine).

In 1991's often daft, and regularly inspiring, City Slickers our three heroes all learn to appreciate life as they drive a herd of cattle to Colorado.Mitch Robbins (Billy Crystal) feels old. Waking on his birthday, he finds himself feeling trapped and miserable. His friends Ed and Phil (Bruno Kirby and Daniel Stern) also have problems in their lives. For Mitch's present, he and his two friends go on a cattle herding holiday to experience a childhood dream. When there, Mitch meets the stone faced Curly (Jack Palance) who helps him to find himself again.From the animated beginning standing out as a tribute to the Pink Panther series, City Slickers has more magical moments than you can count on your hands. Whether a hilarious line that you want to write down to remember, or a visually stunning scene to the film's excellent main score, you think of City Slickers and it's possible to think of a moment to treasure.The acting as well is top notch. Yes, it's true that Billy Crystal is one of these actors \/ comedians that you love or hate, but along with When Harry Met Sally, this is one of his finest hours. Ultimately though, it's not Crystal that should be remembered. Bruno Kirby as Ed Furillo is a revelation, demonstrating a skill for humour and sentimentality at the same time. Again though, Kirby, despite giving such a good performance, is overshadowed by the stunning performance by worthy Oscar winner Jack Palance. Winning the award for best supporting actor (38 years after his nomination for Shane), Palance is impossible to criticise as the mysterious Curly.Key to the success of City Slickers is that simple fact that it truly is an inspiring film. It's possible to create a long list of films which can be described as 'inspirational', but there's just something extra about this film which really hits the spot. Scenes where the three friends ride their horses to the amazing score, they just hit the spot and you find yourself wishing, even if just for a second, that you could be there. It's magical.Some people don't like Billy Crystal as an actor. That's fair enough, that's their choice. Crystal is one of those who you do enjoy watching, or you want to hit him.

Pinhead is merely a creature, only viewed in vital moments of a twisted love story involving otherworldly torture. He is not even called pinhead, he is the lead cenobite, and he will tear your soul apart!The story has a strong narrative hold on a family, and the unresolved matters they have never approached. Such matters include drugs, theft, scandal, love, lust, and demonic dealings. Larry Cotton and his 2nd wife, Julia are happy, cozy, and ready to break new ground as they move into the new home. Unbeknownst to them, an unwelcomed family member is waiting, and so is the awesome force that sealed his fate in life, and in death. This film has more than demons and angels. This film has a plot. Julia helps frank after he narrowly escapes death. Slow, and sure, she feeds him blood, and the lust for life, love, and control takes over the both of them. Soon, Larry's daughter, Kirsty is involved, and the real nightmare begins. This film is more of a fantasy than anything else, as it plays on mystical elements like dreams, love, life, and death. Barker crafts his original novel, titles The Hellbound Heart into a fantastic mold of a supernatural plunge into a very messed up family. More so, this film is a tale of otherworldly pain and torture. Torture is not just the killing, it is the emotional state that Julia is trapped in, as she loves Larry...at first. Soon she is torn between real love, and the lust for pleasure, both physical and emotional. The cenobites take all the emotions, and play with them as though they were throwing a ball back and forth. Barker introduces hell as both emotional, and physical states of mind. No matter where the characters are, hell is what they get. Brilliant performances also highlight this one, with special effects that challenge even todays standards. Good Job Barker!

He treats every role that he is given and provides legitimacy for every movie he has been in. For proof of this please rent The Fifth Element and realize that he is the one of two reasons why that movie doesn't suck. Much like that movie, Romeo Is Bleeding is made by the intensity brought to the screen by Oldman in this film noir-esquire type thriller.Oldman (Leon The Professional) stars as Detective Jack Grimaldi, a cop who is on the take with the local mafia. He provides any and all kinds of information including where federal informants are located. However, when the mafia sends a Russian hit man or woman to take care of an informant, she kills not only the informant but the cops protecting him. Mona, played by Lena Olin (Chocolat) gets caught by the cops and Jack is hired by the mafia boss Don, played by Roy Scheider (Jaws) to kill Mona. Mona gets away and hires Jack to double cross Don. Don finds out and threatens Jack's wife and girlfriend as well as Jacks life if he does not kill her. Jack then tries to come up with a plan to get away from everybody and try and save is failing marriage.As I have said Oldman carries the movie with his acting. He has this dry wit that works so well in these anti-hero roles he takes on. In this movie he is a true anti-hero. Whenever he is sitting with his wife, Natalie, played by Annabella Sciorra (Chasing Liberty) you can see that he loves her. All of the money that he takes gets from the mafia is going to make a better life for the two of them. But he also has a girlfriend, Sheri, played by Juliette Lewis (Starsky & Hutch), and he treats her like she is, easy sex. Oh, and she is not the first girlfriend Jack has had, so he has been cheating on his wife for a long time. Through all of this, Oldman gives a convincing performance and never once is he not believable as this very loving but evil guy.Lena Olin is also convincing as this mean spirited, well, bitch. Along the lines of film noir, Mona is the main cause of Jacks downfall, and Lena plays it perfectly. She adds to the tension and is remarkable in that every scene she is in there is a felling of uncomfortableness that Oldman works off of wonderfully. Both Olin and Oldman light up the screen together.I do have a few complaints, not big though. Roy Scheider is miscast as the mob boss. Not to be stereotyping but he doesn't look Italian, he is definitely not give the image of being tough enough, and there is another actor Dennis Farina (Striking Distance) in the movie that would have been perfect for the part, so its hard not to think how much better he would have been than Scheider. I like the acting he has done in the past, especially Jaws, but not his time.One last actor of note, Michael Wincott (The Crow) had a small role in this film. I have always enjoyed his work, especially The Crow and I don't know why he doesn't get more work. His voice and demeanor make him the classic bad guy and I wish he was out there in more prominent roles.I am amazed that a woman wrote the script for this movie. There are no scenes in the movie that I would say a woman would enjoy. This is a guy movie. How Helen Henkin, who also scripted Road House, knows how to make a guy happy I don't know, but she does. Another complaint is that she did a marvelous job in that every word of dialog is important to the story, but sometimes the scene was a little long. I don't know how, but she should have tightened up some of the scenes. The director Peter Mednek should have noticed this and make the movie flow quicker. He did a great job of bringing us a modern day film noir movie. I just think the pacing could have been quicker.Overall, this is an enjoyable movie, which makes the fact that this was a challenge from Benn all the more fun. This is not a movie for everyone, especially women, so if you feel like watching a decent film noir flick, rent this, just pay attention to every thing and you will enjoy it.

His voice and demeanor make him the classic bad guy and I wish he was out there in more prominent roles.I am amazed that a woman wrote the script for this movie. There are no scenes in the movie that I would say a woman would enjoy. This is a guy movie. How Helen Henkin, who also scripted Road House, knows how to make a guy happy I don't know, but she does. Another complaint is that she did a marvelous job in that every word of dialog is important to the story, but sometimes the scene was a little long. I don't know how, but she should have tightened up some of the scenes. The director Peter Mednek should have noticed this and make the movie flow quicker. He did a great job of bringing us a modern day film noir movie. I just think the pacing could have been quicker.Overall, this is an enjoyable movie, which makes the fact that this was a challenge from Benn all the more fun. This is not a movie for everyone, especially women, so if you feel like watching a decent film noir flick, rent this, just pay attention to every thing and you will enjoy it.

He treats every role that he is given and provides legitimacy for every movie he has been in. For proof of this please rent The Fifth Element and realize that he is the one of two reasons why that movie doesn't suck. Much like that movie, Romeo Is Bleeding is made by the intensity brought to the screen by Oldman in this film noir-esquire type thriller.Oldman (Leon The Professional) stars as Detective Jack Grimaldi, a cop who is on the take with the local mafia. He provides any and all kinds of information including where federal informants are located. However, when the mafia sends a Russian hit man or woman to take care of an informant, she kills not only the informant but the cops protecting him. Mona, played by Lena Olin (Chocolat) gets caught by the cops and Jack is hired by the mafia boss Don, played by Roy Scheider (Jaws) to kill Mona. Mona gets away and hires Jack to double cross Don. Don finds out and threatens Jack's wife and girlfriend as well as Jacks life if he does not kill her. Jack then tries to come up with a plan to get away from everybody and try and save is failing marriage.As I have said Oldman carries the movie with his acting. He has this dry wit that works so well in these anti-hero roles he takes on. In this movie he is a true anti-hero. Whenever he is sitting with his wife, Natalie, played by Annabella Sciorra (Chasing Liberty) you can see that he loves her. All of the money that he takes gets from the mafia is going to make a better life for the two of them. But he also has a girlfriend, Sheri, played by Juliette Lewis (Starsky & Hutch), and he treats her like she is, easy sex. Oh, and she is not the first girlfriend Jack has had, so he has been cheating on his wife for a long time. Through all of this, Oldman gives a convincing performance and never once is he not believable as this very loving but evil guy.Lena Olin is also convincing as this mean spirited, well, bitch. Along the lines of film noir, Mona is the main cause of Jacks downfall, and Lena plays it perfectly. She adds to the tension and is remarkable in that every scene she is in there is a felling of uncomfortableness that Oldman works off of wonderfully. Both Olin and Oldman light up the screen together.I do have a few complaints, not big though. Roy Scheider is miscast as the mob boss. Not to be stereotyping but he doesn't look Italian, he is definitely not give the image of being tough enough, and there is another actor Dennis Farina (Striking Distance) in the movie that would have been perfect for the part, so its hard not to think how much better he would have been than Scheider. I like the acting he has done in the past, especially Jaws, but not his time.One last actor of note, Michael Wincott (The Crow) had a small role in this film. I have always enjoyed his work, especially The Crow and I don't know why he doesn't get more work.

Timothy Dalton played him the way Ian Fleming wrote him, tough but recognizably human. Pierce Brosnan looked the part best.But Roger Moore, when he was on his game, gave us a James Bond better than anyone else's, delivering the right amounts of menace, humor, and charm with an eyebrow as expressive as most actors' entire faces. True, he really only had two superb outings in the seven 007 films he made, and was given to coasting when the script didn't challenge him enough, but The Spy Who Loved Me is the best example of why Moore was a personal favorite for many Bond fans, including me.The British and Russian navies have both lost nuclear submarines, and it is up to Bond to figure out how and why. Partnering, at first reluctantly, then more cozily, with Russian secret agent Triple X (Barbara Bach, deliriously beautiful), Bond figures out the disappearances are part of a plot by an ocean-dwelling madman to destroy the world and rebuild it according to his own principles.The plot really is the weak part of this film, the kind of silly doomsday story Austin Powers would have fun with, but it serves to set up a series of fantastic and engaging set pieces, beginning with an opening snowbound titles sequence that culminates in one of the most awe-inspiring stunts in the Bond corpus. The whole film plays wonderfully from scene-to-scene, with gorgeous cinematography (Egyptian pyramids lit up at night, a sun-drenched Sardinian coastline) and a slightly discofied Marvin Hamlisch score that works off classic Bond themes very well, as well as giving us one of the best theme songs, Carly Simon's Nobody Does It Better. There's also a slew of well-staged and electrifying battles, many involving a tin-toothed adversary of Bond called Jaws who Richard Kiel plays with the right balance of danger and fun.A successful balancing act of danger and fun, unusually well-calibrated, The Spy Who Loved Me may give Bond purists cause to moan the cartoony bits but delivers a film that from bow to stern is the sleekest and sturdiest entertainment vessel in the Bond fleet.Especially good is Moore, who clearly relished the chance to deliver some top-caliber quips for a change. Try the big one, he calmly urges Triple X when she searches for the right ignition key while Jaws crushes their van from the outside. He also gives us some depth, when in the middle of their mission, Triple X confronts him with the fact one of his victims was the man she loved. His reaction is properly serious, and tender, too. In our business, people get killed, he tells her. I know it, you know it, so did he. Bach also is very good, not only for the way she wears a gown but the way she comports herself as Bond's rival and love interest. Her telling Bond she will kill him after the successful completion of their mission is impressive not just because she is so icy but because she shows in her eyes the hurt child who keeps us sympathetic to her even as she draws a line between herself and our hero.The Spy Who Loved Me was a critical film for the Bond series, demonstrating there could be big box office returns for 007 for the first time without Sean Connery, even in the summer of Star Wars. By the way, Shane Rimmer, who plays the American submarine captain in this film and does a very good job with a usually thankless role, was the link between these two summer blockbusters as he is also seen in Star Wars putting Artoo on Luke's X-Wing before the final Death Star battle.The Spy Who Loves Me is not only a great nostalgia bath for those of us who grew up with this movie and let it feed our imaginations, it's a first-class entertainment that holds up better than any other film in the Bond series &#150; even my personal favorite For Your Eyes Only &#150; because of its spectacle, beauty both female and otherwise, and a lead actor who proved nobody did it better when given the right tools to work with.

Also the title is a kind of joke cause in Paris one speaks of a 5 to 7 meaning an illicit affair that takes place after work and before dinnertime.I feel this should not have been a feature though there is so much padding in it. Why does she even need to meet up with this artist's model? she might as well have just arrived in a park randomly and met the Robert walker crossed with pier Paulo pasolini type guy.Maybe it seemed really fresh in 61 to see scads and scads of random shots of people on the streets of Paris who, cleverly, react to the camera, but to the audience it appears they are freaking out over how gorgeous Cleo is. this is cute. And she sure is, sort of a blonde Carolyn Jones type. . . But some of the editing is pretty inexplicable like Cleo says, The word montsouris makes you smile like 'cheese' then we cut to the Taxi sign on the cab then we cut to a view of the ride that includes the Taxi sign. What the hell is that supposed to be? ? ? lol a lot of edits I think looked bad like that. basically hough I just don't think Cleo's wanderings and conversations with people are that interesting, the music is a real weakness in this film for me too, and so also the film's investment in the music, which is considerable. as far as the scene when the musicians come over for a visit, that I found really disagreeable to watch. in the end I feel as though this film presents sort of a man's view of women. whatever she was probably being very honest and this is definitely a pre women's movement film. actually it's about time for films like this again, with women's movement backlash. it's not the ending in which she seems to find the seeds of redemption in capitulating to a strange man's desire but rather the rest of her story how completely vain she seems to be. . . that's disturbing and seems a dude's view of chicks. My main problem was being bored out of my skull by this movie though.there are some great great moments though like this one marvelously uncomfortably long shot of Cleo and the soldier riding in the train, Cleo looking and not looking at him wonderful. Cleo walking along and in a simple way we see that she's got all these people on her mind shots of them almost portrait like in style are cut in one by one...I know we are not supposed to comment on other comments. However, I don't understand how one of these reviews got by opening with the ultimate spoiler telling the first and last scenes of the movie and going on to tell much more. no alert for spoilers anywhere to be seen. this is some kinda oversight I think. . .

Also the title is a kind of joke cause in Paris one speaks of a 5 to 7 meaning an illicit affair that takes place after work and before dinnertime.I feel this should not have been a feature though there is so much padding in it. Why does she even need to meet up with this artist's model? she might as well have just arrived in a park randomly and met the Robert walker crossed with pier Paulo pasolini type guy.Maybe it seemed really fresh in 61 to see scads and scads of random shots of people on the streets of Paris who, cleverly, react to the camera, but to the audience it appears they are freaking out over how gorgeous Cleo is. this is cute. And she sure is, sort of a blonde Carolyn Jones type. . . But some of the editing is pretty inexplicable like Cleo says, The word montsouris makes you smile like 'cheese' then we cut to the Taxi sign on the cab then we cut to a view of the ride that includes the Taxi sign. What the hell is that supposed to be? ? ? lol a lot of edits I think looked bad like that. basically hough I just don't think Cleo's wanderings and conversations with people are that interesting, the music is a real weakness in this film for me too, and so also the film's investment in the music, which is considerable. as far as the scene when the musicians come over for a visit, that I found really disagreeable to watch. in the end I feel as though this film presents sort of a man's view of women. whatever she was probably being very honest and this is definitely a pre women's movement film. actually it's about time for films like this again, with women's movement backlash. it's not the ending in which she seems to find the seeds of redemption in capitulating to a strange man's desire but rather the rest of her story how completely vain she seems to be. . . that's disturbing and seems a dude's view of chicks. My main problem was being bored out of my skull by this movie though.there are some great great moments though like this one marvelously uncomfortably long shot of Cleo and the soldier riding in the train, Cleo looking and not looking at him wonderful. Cleo walking along and in a simple way we see that she's got all these people on her mind shots of them almost portrait like in style are cut in one by one...I know we are not supposed to comment on other comments. However, I don't understand how one of these reviews got by opening with the ultimate spoiler telling the first and last scenes of the movie and going on to tell much more. no alert for spoilers anywhere to be seen. this is some kinda oversight I think. . .

It is an all-American feel-good movie with a simple message. The writers must have attended the Feel Good School of movies and then thrown in everything from their textbooks into the script.The movie is set in small-town USA during the 1950s. It inhabitants are all kind, good natured, hard working, community driven people. There is not a single person in this town who is capable of a bad thought. Luke's fiancée Adele is the sweet, pretty (blonde), smart and devoted girlfriend. Luke's father is a gentle old man filled with love for his son and his old movie theater. The mayor is a friendly, community oriented leader. Heck, even the concession stand lady is sweet and lovable. This is such an idyllic portrayal of a town that it comes across and completely unbelievable. This kind of town cannot possible exist on this Earth.The key poignant moments such as the opening of the theater, Luke's father's death, Adele's talk with Luke at the cemetery and the speech at the HUAC hearing are so over-dramatic it makes you want to wretch. The dialogue is taken straight out of the Big Book of American Clichés is is absolutely cringe-worthy. The movie's themes of freedom of speech, heroism and hope are so simplistic that I felt insulted. A 5 year old could process more complex thoughts.In addition, the freedom of speech theme comes completely out of nowhere and completely shifts the focus of the movie with 30 minutes to go. It seems like a last-minute add on, thrown in as an easy way to wrap the movie up. When confronting the HUAC in court, Jim Carey simply invokes the First Amendment, tells the committee to go stuff itself and then WALKS OUT of court to a standing ovation. What? Are you serious?! The scene was so ridiculous that I was practically on the floor laughing.This movie is a complete waste of time for anyone who likes a movie that provokes thought, any thought, even just a little one. If you like to be spoon-fed feel-good Americana, then this is the perfect movie for you.

As soon as he touches down atop of the Pan-Am building, he realises the alien environment he finds himself in and in stark contrast to the bleak and desolate Arizona desert in which we first meet him. Coogan on the other hand is just as alien to the native New Yorkers he encounters. He arrives at the district Police Station to pick up his fugitive and take him home, but His task is not as cut and dried as he had hoped when he meets bad tempered but good natured veteran Cop McElroy (Lee J Cobb) who tells Coogan that his prisoner James Ringerman (played menacingly by Don Stroud), has already taken a 'trip' of a different nature and is in the Prison Ward at Belview Hospital.Coogan's set back means that he has to stay in New York longer than he had planned (or hoped). but compensation takes the form of parole officer Julie Roth (Susan Clark). After Wining & Dining her, goes back to her place. His intended night of passion never gets off the ground as she is interrupted by a business call. After his first night in New York, Coogan is determined that it is to be his last and 'Bluffs' his way in to the Prison Ward at Belview in the hopes of engineering Ringerman's release into his custody. he not only encounters Ringerman but also his spaced out girlfriend Linny Raven. His impulsive ruse pays off, and he and his prisoner head off to the Pan-Am building and their awaiting Arizona bound flight. However, Raven has arranged a welcoming party for Coogan and after the 'oldest trick in the book' type of ambush, Coogan is lying unconscious on the airport floor, and Ringerman is once again at large.Ringerman now has the upper hand, knowing that Coogan's desert tracking skills are useless in the Concrete Jungle of 1968 New York but undeterred, Coogan sets about making his enquiries despite a stern warning not to interfere by McElroy. He is arrested for impersonating a police officer and McElroy takes the liberty of arranging Coogan's prompt and immediate return to Arizona. Coogan's plans remain unchanged and he will not leave New York alone. He resumes his relationship with Roth, and while she's out of the room takes a snoop at her parole files and finds the parole record of Raven. His nosiness reaps rewards, and his leg-work takes him to the physcodelic Pigeon Toed Orange Peel Club, where he once again encounters Raven. He ruthlessly seduces her in the hopes that his lovemaking will make her betray Ringermans whereabouts, but Raven is as manipulative as she is beautiful and she leads Coogan to a pool hall and yet another ambush. This time Coogan gives his attackers as good as he gets, yet still manages to get the ass whippin' of a lifetime. He escapes the pool hall just in time before McElroy and his squad break down the door. Coogan returns to Raven's Apartment only this time he persuades her by using 'less romantic' methods.Fearing for her life, she finally leads Coogan straight to Ringerman and the final confrontation.Eastwood's performance as the fish out of water cop is magnificent and is a great bridge between Clint the cowboy and Clint the modern day action hero as it is essentially an amalgamation of the two. The script calls for Clint to be ruthless, violent and menacing as all his previous roles had, but this movie showed a different side to Eastwood, hitherto unseen since his rise to stardom half a decade before. Coogans Bluff required Eastwood to be Romantic, and charming and witty, in fact the character of Coogan is blessed with a wry almost dead-pan dark sense of humour displayed in some of his classic one liners.Taxi Driver that'll be $2.95 including the luggage. Coogan Here's 3 dollars including the tip.or reprising this encounter with a hotel owner.Hotel Owner That'll be £7 Coogan The sign says 5 Hotel Owner 7 without luggage (Coogan shows his briefcase) That ain't luggage. Coogan There's a cab drive in this town that'll give you an argument.Siegel's Direction is as always impeccable and the fight at Pushy's Pool Hall, is one of the best choreographed action sequences ever put to film.Eastwood is also seen performing (some) of his own stunts as is evident during the motorcycle chase when you see his face in close-up. Lalo Schifrin, (a very busy man in 1968), gives us one of his best scores and his 'pidgeon toed orange peel' song epitomised the period perfectly.This film also gives us a good look at New York and to use a Clint Cliché, shows us the good, the bad and the darn right ugly of what the Big Apple has (or in many cases did) have to offer. and shows us New York when it was an evolving city, when the 50's and Early 60's style of Car design, clothing fashions and moral attitudes were slowly being replaced by their more basic and simple counterparts of the 70's.10 out of 10 if not for Clint's witty dialogue alone ","genre":null},{"date":"25 April 2005","score":"6 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":" Coogans Bluff, though widely forgotten when compared to the 'dollars' trilogy or the Dirty Harry movies, is one of Clint Eastwoods best projects and boasts what I feel is his best on-screen performance.Arizona Deputy Sheriff Coogan is dispatched to New York to extradite a New York Junkie to face trial for his Crimes in the West.
