Some saying its the best Exorcist sequel and some saying its utter crap. Well to the people who say it's utter crap you have no idea what your talking about. This is by far the best Exorcist sequel, probably because it was actually written by William Peter Blatty (Writer of the first Exorcist). I think this should really be the Exorcist II because it begins where the first one finishes, and also because The Heretic was a joke.One of the reasons why I love this film is because it is essentially a mystery film (which I'm not usually to keen on) but it also has the major horror elements that make a horror film. The hallway scene at the hospital is one of the best horror scenes I have seen. Just the tension and the fact you don't know whats going on and the silence, then suddenly... well I wont give anything away. Its definitely different to the original so if your looking for another The Exorcist then look elsewhere, but this will probably still scare the daylights out of you.Overall, fantastic film and I'm glad that Father Karras is in this film because I loved his character in the original. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 August 2009","score":"13 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":" I have heard mixed reviews of this film.

It stars Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, Christian Slater, William Petersen, Alan Ruck, Vigo Mortensen and Balthazar Getty. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri, with contributions from Jon Bon Jovi, and cinematography is by Dean Semler Brushy Bill Roberts, old and crusty, claims to be Billy The Kid. Which is quite a claim considering the Kid was long thought to have been killed by Patrick Floyd Garrett in 1881. Roberts tells a listening historian that after the break up of the Tunstall Regulators, the remaining members hooked up with Garrett and Arkansas Dave Rudabaugh and still lived the outlaw life.....Young Guns was released in 1988 and became a big enough hit to warrant this sequel two years later. Reuniting gunslingers Billy the Kid (Estevez), Doc Scurlock (Sutherland) and Chavez (Phillips) from the first film, Young Guns II follows the same formula that worked two years previously. Billy is still a borderline nut case and his gang, for better or worse, follow him into a number of escapades. This time around, though, we have some added interest in the form of Christian Slater's cocky Rudabaugh, who, as an egotist, wants to run the gang himself. Things are further given a lift when Garrett (a darn fine William Petersen resplendent with major face fuzz) leaves the gang and is persuaded to become a law man. His first job being of course to catch Billy!Both Young Guns movies are frowned upon by many old school Western purists, which to a degree I understand. They lack any sort of psychological aspects outside of a brat packer like cast shooting and quipping with care free abandon. Character depth is lacking so there is nothing on which to hang your hat on. Here, much like the first film, creative license is used with historical facts but the core basis of story is solid, with many of the events leading up to the documented death of Billy the Kid holding true. Major problem here, though, is that the makers are spinning off from the iffy claim of Brushy Bill Roberts that he was Billy the Kid and did not die at the hands of Pat Garrett. Knowing Billy survives the pursuit and show-down with Garrett at the start of the film kind of dilutes the wonder and impending drama! Film also at times feels like a composite of Little Big Man, Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid and of course Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid.However, both films, and more so with this sequel, have such a sense of fun like homage to them it's not hard to forgive the obvious flaws. Action is plentiful, with much blood shed during the course of the story, while the story always remains intriguing by way of the character dynamics. Semler's photography is more in tune with the Wild West this time around, as is Silvestri's score, the latter of which lifts parts of his Predator arrangement to blend with more traditional cowboy harmonies. Great song from Bon Jovi to close the film down as well. There's also a nice link to Peckinpah's movie with an important cameo for James Coburn as John Chisum (Coburn played Pat Garrett). But most of all it's just great fun to be in the company of Estevez's Billy, true enough to say it comes at the expense of the other characters around him, it's a film owning show, which also dubiously swerves us into cheering for the baby faced outlaw hero, but it plays out as a rollicking good ride in spite of grey area thematics and roll call of clichés. And boys, oh boys, Jenny Wright pops in to raise the temperatures considerably with a Lady Godiva moment. If for nothing else, the Young Guns movies got people talking about the Western in the MTV age, that has to be a bonus to the discerning Western fan. Acknowledge the faults by all means, but viewing them as gunslinging fun wrapped around real Western folklore might just help you enjoy the experience. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 August 2009","score":"","review":" Young Guns II is directed by Geoff Murphy and written by John Fusco.

Most of the characters are fine but not in a capable drama. Let's face it. (James Cameron) wanted mainly a big production action movie, not a romantic epic. The start is too long and boring. The women's heart is a deep ocean of secrets aside from being the movie's only interesting line, it's not that interesting in the first place (sometimes the man's heart is a deep ocean of secrets also!).I hated the nude scene, something ruined the romantic sense of the movie thereafter. Talk about ruining; then it's more than clear that the chemistry between the 2 leads was missing. Nearly a million people, I'm one of them, saw that (Kate Winslet) is a bit fat for the thin (Leonardo DiCaprio), so how about older as well ! I can't stand the fact that (Rose) is the one who killed (Jack), when she left him in the icy water, why she didn't give him part of raft, or got to be on it for some, then Jack for some??.. SO SELFISH ! And yes, the tragedy of My Hard Will Go on ! For anyone who didn't live 1997, that was a complete nightmare pals.

If something about it is really great, else the global mania, so it is its CGI. (Cameron) dreamed and fulfilled perfectly in that area. Anyhow, this is a very good movie after all. An action fare, a powerful disaster flick, with some romantic moments. It got an old love story yet with a lovely charisma as a whole. But, it only doesn't work for me. Sometimes (it's all the time) you have another taste. Though, I liked some nice bits; like how (Jack) is the youthful lively modernism of this stiff world.

And I liked the final scene\/ Rose's dream where her love goes on and on. But, to tell you the truth, it was one of the excellent endings which you wish another, more deep and satisfying, movie for it !If you looked to the whole history of cinema you'll find many movies, like Titanic or better, whether they were meant to be big hits or just truthful works they didn't make it to be the most successful ever. It's just a certain moment when the audience needs all what one movie has. However, the audience's necessities remain vague, unpredictable and change from time to time.

It may still be fun to see the guys from Angel Beach interact, but they have absolutely nothing interesting to do and things get boring. Their main story has been over for a while, so they have to get by on lame, far-fetched story lines that really scrape the bottom of the barrel (the KKK subplot anyone?). And occasionally they also get involved in a lame practical joke that takes forever to set up. It's still Porky's, so I can't hate it, but the first is just so much better.

This is of course, is the exact vein upon which the remake is being built in this, our era of horror-porn. The problem I have with this is that you're not really supposed to be in awe of the coolness when Tina is dragged across the ceiling -- you're supposed to be terrified of the enormous power wielded by an unknown figure through dreams and you are supposed to relate with the utter hopelessness that these characters face. Wes Craven went to great lengths to personify this in the first film obviously, through his writing and character development.Unlike the other films, this movie is completely somber and practically joyless. In the sequels, the writers are constantly hinting at the possibility of beating Freddy while gearing them up for the next spectacular! kill scene, and always comforting the audience that there will be a happy resolution (until they screw you over with the last second reveal that will guarantee another sequel).There is all this long and supportive dialog between the characters in the sequels We can fight him! We can beat him!, where in the first film, all of these characters (and especially Nancy) are pretty much on their own. Glenn will help comfort Tina, but only up to the point that it interferes with his lustful feelings for Nancy or his patience. Glenn supports Nancy, but abandons her by falling asleep on her the first time (dismissing her sincerity, not with his words but with his actions) and then falling asleep and dying before he was to come to her rescue as they'd planned. Nancy distrusts Rod and abandons him mid-conversation in the jail and is unsure of his motivations until just before the moment he dies. Rod and Tina are connected mostly by physical attraction and show little else (though they briefly show a somewhat deeper connection in there post-coital moments). Lt. Thompson just wants his baby girl to get some sleep and get out of his hair while he does his police work. Marge maintains appearances, but is more dedicated to a bottle of Vodka then her family, in addition to hiding ugly details about her past. Even Tina's mother is short with her in the first scene, annoyed that she was awakened or interrupted and then summoned by something as silly as a nightmare.There is such a feeling of distrust and disconnectedness between these characters even before the killing starts -- they are already doomed by their vague sadness and broken connections. They are all adrift and without a friend in a cruel world of which there is no hope of escaping or possibility of someone reaching out to them.In my mind, this is what makes it far superior to any of the other films. New Nightmare is a good film, but in a completely different way then the first film, and it certainly does not compare as a piece of surrealist horror. The third sequel possess some of the qualities of the first film (making attempts at emulating the tone of the first film) but it unravels due to them breaking rules set by the first film in order to cheat the audience and also by imbibing Freddy with this jokester-smarminess that would get out of control in the subsequent sequels.I always preferred the term fantasy terror to slasher film for this picture. It certainly has elements of a slasher, but it has SO much more and putting it on level with Friday the 13th or even Halloween (which IS a slasher movie, but it's one of the first and the most well-done one) is doing it a disservice in my opinion.

When you unleash Snipes, it's pretty hard to mess it up. This manages to lift it beyond that, and while the action(which is never excessive, and always forwards the plot), cool and well-done shoot-outs and awesome, well-choreographed martial arts alike, is all intense, fun and exciting, it does marvelous on almost everything else, as well. From my understanding of the title character, this really nails it(and the gallery, including and beyond that, is magnificent, very colorful and imaginative). The psychology is accurate, and it's also communicated nicely to the audience, not talking down to us and not being too obvious. Design is excellent, the utilitarian approach to the weapons is spot-on. The casting is great, Dorff, Lords and Jover make such good vampires. So does Udo Kier, but A, this isn't the first time he portrays one, and B, everybody who's seen the man in anything could have told you that. For such a subject, this is somewhat different than the traditional movie about the creatures. It is rather bloody, violent and gory, and not everyone will have the stomach for it. The tone is brutal and gritty. There is convincing atmosphere and suspense in this. The acting is a tad mixed, though there are no downright poor performances. CGI isn't bad, it was done on not that huge of a budget considering the amount, and it certainly works. The music is kick-ass. This is nicely stylized, and it doesn't go overboard. The humor is genuinely funny, very natural, and doesn't try too hard. Script is well-written, dialog and story alike. This is paced well, very fast and smooth. The cinematography and editing are flawless and just a little bit creative, without this becoming an experimental film. There is plenty of strong language in this. The DVD comes with an informative commentary track of several people(cutting back and forth between them), two featurettes I will review on their respective entries here on the site, half a dozen minutes or so of random behind-the-scenes footage, and a few short, and spoiler-free, interviews. I recommend this to fans of those who made it, and anyone who enjoys Wesley fighting on-screen. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"27 August 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I have not had very much experience with the comics, so I cannot make many comparisons to them.

For such a subject, this is somewhat different than the traditional movie about the creatures. It is rather bloody, violent and gory, and not everyone will have the stomach for it. The tone is brutal and gritty. There is convincing atmosphere and suspense in this. The acting is a tad mixed, though there are no downright poor performances. CGI isn't bad, it was done on not that huge of a budget considering the amount, and it certainly works. The music is kick-ass. This is nicely stylized, and it doesn't go overboard. The humor is genuinely funny, very natural, and doesn't try too hard. Script is well-written, dialog and story alike. This is paced well, very fast and smooth. The cinematography and editing are flawless and just a little bit creative, without this becoming an experimental film. There is plenty of strong language in this. The DVD comes with an informative commentary track of several people(cutting back and forth between them), two featurettes I will review on their respective entries here on the site, half a dozen minutes or so of random behind-the-scenes footage, and a few short, and spoiler-free, interviews. I recommend this to fans of those who made it, and anyone who enjoys Wesley fighting on-screen. 8\/10 ","genre":"Action, Horror"},{"date":"27 August 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I have not had very much experience with the comics, so I cannot make many comparisons to them. When you unleash Snipes, it's pretty hard to mess it up. This manages to lift it beyond that, and while the action(which is never excessive, and always forwards the plot), cool and well-done shoot-outs and awesome, well-choreographed martial arts alike, is all intense, fun and exciting, it does marvelous on almost everything else, as well. From my understanding of the title character, this really nails it(and the gallery, including and beyond that, is magnificent, very colorful and imaginative). The psychology is accurate, and it's also communicated nicely to the audience, not talking down to us and not being too obvious.

Austin Powers in Goldmemeber isn't in the trilogy curse. I don't think it's the best in the trilogy but it's still better than The Spy who shagged me. The reason why it's better is because it tones it down a little on the immaturity. Am I saying that the film isn't immature? No. I'm just saying that there's not as many gross moments. In the last film, they introduced a new character named Fat Bastard, who is in this film also. But not as much. Fat Bastard is absolutely gross, and one of the reasons why I didn't like it as much. Also, there is a scene where Austin drinks Fat Bastard's crap. And said it's a bit nutty. That's just gross. That was the humor that that film stuck with. i liked it, but it was very gross at times. Austin Powers in Goldmemeber is an improvement for many reasons. It makes you laugh a bit more. The jokes aren't that as crude and I prefer some of the new characters. Or, new character.

Not very gentlemanly, and not very agreeable...In researching an investigative piece on anti-Semitism for his New York newspaper, Phil Schuyler Green hits on the idea to go deep undercover and pretend to be Jewish; to live in Jewish skin and report how society reacts to him. His scheme goes all too well, as he is dis-invited to certain parties, loses work, learns the bitter meaning of restricted hotels, has to defend his son at school, and even uncovers deep-rooted, unrealized anti-Semitism in his fiancé.Gregory Peck is Phil Green, widower, father to Tommy (Dean Stockwell, only 11 years old!), fiancé to bigot, Kathy (Dorothy McGuire, constantly in annoying soft-focus), and all-round Noble Guy.Released just after the Holocaust, can any of us in 2009 apprehend how this anti-Semitism sermon would have felt like electrodes on the testes of society?

But Phil's point is that you have to fight it even if you're not Jewish because Jews can't simply fall back on Christianity. She doesn't get it.

The most obvious trait is that John Wayne's character Ethan Edwards, is a severe racist, this being perhaps the only motivation to keep him on the trail.The opening shot is quite stunning as we see a black silhouette of a woman against the backdrop of a wide panoramic view of the American West. It is in this shot that John Ford relates to the audience the scope and magnitude of this movie. As the story progresses, we follow Ethan,a loner and former Civil War soldier who seems to have a chip on his shoulder due perhaps to his mysterious past. There are a lot of mysteries in this movie, such as the relationship between Ethan and his brother's wife, Martha. Or, the relationship Ethan has with his riding partner, Martin Pawley. This is maybe the key element as we find it interesting how Ethan can stand a young man he rescued as a boy and later finds out is 1\/8 Cherokee, something Ethan later regrets. So much more is going on here and it will certainly take multiple viewings to get it all.From this first viewing, I can say with confidence that this is John Wayne's finest hour as one of the biggest American movie stars. He is angry, sullen, alone, self-loathing, everything John Wayne usually is not. He holds this story together and there is something in him we admire, despite his racist outlook on life. Ford once again captures the Old West beautifully, but never before has it looked so good, so full, so real. Someone once asked me if it was a background. All I could do was point to any shot and ask, does that look fake to you? Undoubtedly one John Ford's greatest achievements, The Searchers captures the saga of the American West as no other film ever has, proving again its immortal status in our memories and its influence on countless movies after it.

Not saying that you won't find it in stores. I mean that there is no other movie like it. If you've seen it, you know that it's impossible. Being John Malkovich is very weird and hilarious at times. I never knew someone could come up with such a brilliant idea. Not only is the film hilarious and weird, it's also unique. It must've taken them a long time to write this movie. The end of Being John Malkovich is rather surprising. I will bring up one performance in particular. I'm bringing up Cathrine Keener's performance. If anyone knows how to play a bitch, it's Cathrine Keener. It seems like every film that she is in she plays a bitch. She plays one in this movie also. John Cusack is of course great as Craig. I also liked Cameron Diaz, the usual, as Craig's wife. Being John Malkovich has many memorable scenes. Including one scene where John Malkovich himself goes into his mind. I won't spoil that part for you. Director Spike Jonze has found a way to make a new kind of movie. Being John Malkovich is a fantastic film with a weird cast and I think it was the best movie of 1999. Not American Beauty, Being John Malkovich.The Plot Craig is a puppeteer who gets a Job at Lester Corp. on the 7 and a half floor. While working there he falls in love with Maxine, a snotty woman who works there. He also discovers a portal that can lead you into John Malkovich's mind and you can be John Malkovich.

Especially when the first descriptions said Marcia would have a gay girlfriend... I just thought the whole thing would be sickening. I was wrong.The beauty of this movie is that they take the Brady Bunch, right out of 1970, and drop them into 1995. HOW such a thing could be, I can't say, but it was a brilliant idea. Somehow, in the middle of the 1990's, the Brady family is firmly entrenched in 1970. They've got the cars, the clothes, the music, it's like the whole world around them doesn't exist! They either don't notice, or don't care. For example, Greg drives Marcia to their high school in Mrs. Brady's station wagon and along the way they are listening to an 8 track tape of Davy Jones singing. WHERE would they get an 8 track tape like that - and in 1995?! Well, don't worry too much about that, just accept it and laugh at it. Okay, so they get to school and Marcia says she has written to Davy Jones to see if he will sing at their school's dance. Greg scoffs at the idea because 'a big star like that is too busy to come to our dance!' I mean, where do they see Davy Jones as a star at all in the 1990's? He's got no hits, you'd never see him on TV... yet to the Brady's, he is a superstar and they are playing 8 track tapes of him gotten from who-knows-where.Where would they get their flare-bottom pants and gaudy patterned clothes? The square-toed mid-heel shoes? The paisley shirts? Their cars are right out of 1970 or so (though not the same cars they drove on the TV show). Where? When? How? You don't ask such questions, you just accept and laugh at the insanity of it all.The beauty of this movie is watching the 1970 Brady Family as they interact with the world around them which is 25 years further along. Okay, they do put some edge on the family members and they do get a little fun poked at them - like when Greg as Johnny Bravo gets up to perform at his school dance and says 'I wrote this song for the grooviest chick at Westdale High' and girls run screaming out of the gymnasium. And the drunk woman who lives next door has the hots for Mr. Brady - and Greg - and even Peter.It's a really funny movie. I never thought I'd have liked it but when I finally watched it, I realized what an ingenious idea it was. There is a sequel to this movie which IMO is one of the reasons sequels are usually no good, just an attempt to cash in on a good original.Finally, even as this movie makes fun of the Brady family, it does so with some heart. The humor is good-natured; the family members are still all likable and are treated with affection even as they are the source of the humor. If you always loved the Brady Bunch, this movie won't anger you by the way they were treated.
