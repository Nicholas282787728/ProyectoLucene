This one starts out with an assassination attempt on Amidale and great scenes like those Lucas ripped right out of the film The Fifth Element and had people selling death sticks (oh, what a clever jab at the tobacco trade). This film offers nothing new in the way of establishing a decent plot, other than the brief mention of the clone wars from the original Star Wars film. The guy they got to play Anakin was rather bad at his lines and was even stiffer than Ewan though I really think Ewan's main problem is that he did not want to really be in these films. We also get the origins of Bubba Fett as a guy who had less than ten minutes screen time in the original trilogy really needed a whole section of the movie dedicated to how he came about. Really this should show movie makers do not make scenes based on the fans wishes. Sure for some reason Bubba had his fans, but in the end his character was not important enough to merit this much attention. The only thing more stupid was making C-3PO a creation of Anakin even though he was a widely recognized protocol droid in the original series and adding Chewbacca for the heck of it in the final film in this rather badly written trilogy. There are scenes here and there that are good though (though not any scene where Anakin and Amidale are acting cutesy). Then Christopher Lee comes in and acts rings around everyone else and has the most entertaining fight in the movie as he takes on Yoda.

In these movies, plot is of little to no importance. Sexy Beast is clearly in this category, and what makes it so watchable is the brilliant performances by Ray Winstone and especially Ben Kingsley.Gal (Ray Winstone) is a career criminal who has retired to Spain, living a life of luxury with his beautiful wife DeeDee (Amanda Redman). Life is great, but then his friends, Aitch (Cavan Kendall) and Jackie (Julianne White) get a call from from Don Logan (Ben Kingsley). Don arrives the next day to get Gal to come out of retirement and do another job. Gal declines, but the psychotic Don won't take no for an answer.As good as the script is (and it's very good), where Sexy Beast really shines is the performances. Ray Winstone is doing a nice change of pace as a sympathetic ex-criminal. Winstone, who has been known to play villains of the worst kind (like Dad in The War Zone, for example) is very effective in the role. It's not necessarily the fear of getting caught that makes him reluctant to do the job, it's the fact that he just want to done with that life. But both he and Don know that money was never an object in their life of crime; it was the adrenaline rush they got from doing it. And that kind of a reaction is hard to turn down. Then there's Ben Kingsley, who is completely arresting as Don. Psychotic doesn't do him justice. This is a guy who would beat someone to death at the blink of an eye and go right back to his drink as if nothing had happened. There isn't a single moment that Kingsley is on screen and he doesn't command our absolute attention. Ian McShane is also quite good as the creepy mastermind behind the heist, Teddy Bass. I was reminded of Christoph Waltz in Inglorious Basterds in the way that he seems to know everything, but plays dumb. It's a creepy effect, and McShane is adept at utilizing his facial features to emphasize this.When I realized that this was directed by Jonathan Glazer, whose next film was Birth, a creepy and haunting psychological thriller that was ruined mostly by inept direction, I had my doubts about this movie. Never fear, however, because they are nothing alike. It's a little on the long side (even at a skinny 89 minutes), and there are a few too many directorial flourishes that call attention to themselves too much, but for the most part, the film is well directed.This isn't an action movie, but for those who like outstanding acting and strong dialogue, it's well worth your time.

Usually making a choice like that isn't easy, but it wins my #1 spot in spades. The true beauty behind Batman 1989 is Burton's flavor. Letting a non-traditionalist visionary like Burton direct Batman was a big risk for Warner Bros considering all the expectations that inevitably would be riding on it. Burton was allowed to reinvent the substance of everything Batman by twisting it into a dark, evil paradox. He didn't just make a movie about Batman, he changed the public's idea of what Batman should be forever. No other comic book movie can make a claim that touches that.Another beautiful element of this movie is its mix of Gothic fantasy and shoot 'em up action. Even though Burton was given most creative control, he knew he had to give this film all the explosive action that's typical for a late 80's high budget action thriller. So it comes across as Tim Burton in overdrive, in which he pushed his own limits of potential. Batman thrives from its late 80's production. This is when action movie production was at an all time high, and before unnatural computer generated effects most new action films suffer from. So despite its over the top sequences, it still has a sense of truth about it. One action sequence I consider one of the coolest ever is when The Batmobile drives into the Joker's chemical factory, henchmen start shooting at it with machine guns, it stops, drops some mines, then drives out while the entire complex is blowing up (awesome!) There is another aspect of this film that is excellent but often unnoticed compared to the strength and drive of the storytelling. That's how this film completely manipulates the viewer's sense of time. Burton is a master at this. It routinely changes from a dark, saddened 1940's big city feel to a glossed over, gritty, material late 80's. Burton transformed much of The Joker's character to model a 1940's gangster boss, which I think is a neat creative throwback and fitting addition. Many of the Joker's men resemble Al Capone style cronies and carry classic weapons like Tommy Guns, .45 pistols, and revolvers.Another great element of this film is its occasional sense of lighthearted fun, despite all the darkness. This is present during the Joker party scenes with Prince music (the one in the art gallery is the best). I love how The Joker was transformed into a more dynamic character. He's insane, but also has an appreciation for art, and is a genius chemical expert. Nicholson's performance as The Joker was superb and unmatchable by any standards. He made The Joker fun, evil, crazy, but also added a sense of gentlemen class to the character. His wicked Joker laugh is incredible to say the least. His creative one liners are also fun and unexpected, such as there's another rooster in the hen house and ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight? Danny Elfman's brilliant, gracefully haunting score is an undeniable driving force behind this movie. The intro with this score takes the viewer through dark tunnel-like grooves that eventually end up being the Batman symbol. This is a superb sequence and very innovative for the time, influencing many similar scenes in future films. Another thing we cannot forget is the Batmobile! It's too bad there's no academy award for vehicle design because that was deserved! It's sleek, curvaceous, all black, menacing, and powered by a jet thruster. It looks like a fighter jet on wheels with tail fins.This is my best attempt to describe in words what makes this film great, although it's impossible to note everything. Batman 1989 is a masterfully entertaining super film in every sense. Hopefully someday we will see something like it again in Hollywood.

Batman 1989 is a masterfully entertaining super film in every sense. Hopefully someday we will see something like it again in Hollywood.

Today, they live on the same routine of receiving brutality from many citizens. The Time of the Gypsies shows us the lives of the Gypsies on an everyday basis, and the daily routines they must face in order to live. Watching this movie for the first time, my mindset changed completely when thinking of gypsies. That is not what I thought the theme was however; the theme to me was loss of innocence. Perhan, the protagonist of the movie, starts off as off as an innocent kid living with his grandma and sister as a good son. At the end, he becomes like the character Ahmed, who is known as the money king. When innocent Perhan meets Ahmed, things begin to change for Perhan. In a way, Perhan is on the way to becoming Ahmed, except nature seems to get in his way. Nature, however, doesn't completely stop Perhan from becoming a greedy smuggler. We later end up finding out that Ahmed tricked Perhan into working for him. Another important concept in this film is the power of revenge. After finding out what a hypocrite Ahmed is, Perhan wants nothing but revenge. Perhan gets his revenge, but in the process, he gets himself killed. This film teaches people not to grow greedy and stay true to your family and the ones you love. Money should not come in the way of things that are the most important to you.

Dealing strictly with the Maori culture and never showing an outsider to said culture. Following a family, the film has very strong content, that ends up giving the movie a stronger feeling as well.Dealing with issues such as a loss of identity, lack of education, lack of wealth, family violence; the movie can be hard to stomach at times. With a few very strong scenes that will reach even the toughest of souls, the message of the movie is very powerful. A loss of identity is felt individually in each character as they struggle in their own way to find their roots. Suffering from the western influence the characters have to find one way or another to keep alive the Maori tradition.

In this case, the cantankerous person is actor Peter Boyle, Hollywood's poster boy for racism ever since his iconic performance in the 1970 film Joe.Boyle, whose character is a shameless racist who spews the N word like a KKK water fountain, also plays the father of Hank Grotowski (Billy Bob Thornton), who at first shares his father's racism, but after the death of his own son suddenly gets sensitive, renouncing racism and resigning from his job at a prison.Why does the son's death affect Billy Bob? Because Billy's son embodies a kind of caring, progressive attitude, a sharp contrast to his mean-spirited father and grandfather. Before he dies, the son even admitts that he loved his daddy unconditionally, despite his father's abusive nature. The kid's death thus teaches Billy a kind of unconditional love.From here on, Billy Bob magically transforms from a prison worker (caging black men) to a friend of the black community (he befriends black actor Mos Def etc). What's more, he turns from the executioner of a black man called Lawrence, to the lover of this same black man's wife, played by Halle Berry.Seeing the grieving Halle Berry, Billy Bob immediately wants to comfort her. On the literal level, he realises that by sending her husband to the electric chair he caused her anguish. But the film's larger, quite condescending point, is that Billy Bob has seen the effects of racism and so wants to make up for this by giving Halle some finger lickin' white lovin'.The middle portion of the film then involves Billy Bob going to the café at which Halle Berry works. He orders black coffee and chocolate ice-cream whilst he sizes up his sexy, ghetto waitress. You can tell by his hungry eyes that he'd love to sink his redneck teeth into Halle Berry's juicy chocolate cupcakes. His chocolate cravings, his salivating jungle fever, should be played as comedy (see Spike Lee's She Hate Me), but director Marc Forster instead plays things with ridiculous solemnity. This lends the film a tone which feels ignorant and borderline offensive, Forster quietly baiting his audience into wanting to see some hot, interracial, taboo busting sex.The character's themselves are oddly written. Billy Bob is a redneck Polish American with the surname Grotowski (see Australia, where all racism is transplanted to similar Polish caricatures) and Halle Berry's character is written like some weird parody of blackness (eg- she tells her morbidly obese son that she'll slap the blackness out of him!), spewing silly jive dialogue and goofy black mannerisms. She's the typical bi-racial tragic mulatto stereotype, who is assumed to be sad and suicidal because she fails to assimilate into either the white or black world. A real, fully black character would scare white audiences, so we get instead a mixed race Beyonce\/Obama hybrid, white and frail enough to not threaten the film's white audience, but black enough to instigate a guilt trip.Berry's character herself seems confused about race. Spew racist words to a black woman in rural Georgia and she'll give you a piece of her mind, whereas Berry is a meek, docile creature. Racism in this film isn't anything more than a personal defect. A psychological problem. A personality quirk which must be overcome by the commingling of white and black flesh, (see Dances With Wolves, Sayonara, Lone Star, Man Called Horse, Heaven and Earth, The Searchers, Passage To India, Avatar etc, where sex becomes a clunky metaphor for the soothing of racial tensions). In other words, this is sex as racial therapy. The broken black woman can only be made whole again if the white man takes care of her in a benevolent, paternalistic way, her wounds healed by some white on black clitoral stimulation.As the film progresses, the camera, the white male gaze, systematically reduces Berry to an object of suffering and tragedy. Watch how she LITERALLY loses everything she has in the film and becomes an objectified victim. A symbol of failure, unable to support herself, having lost her son and husband, she then begs her white slave master to hump her in as violent a way as possible so that she can feel good. Billy Bob acts hesitant. Acts like he's somewhat reluctant...but we know he's simply being polite. That he's leaving enough space for disavowal. In truth, he can't resist her. How often does a redneck get to bang a hot emo black woman (not too black, of course. Halle Berry is practically white, so as to guarantee maximum erections) without asking for permission? This is thus a typical male erotic fantasy, the hesitant white man dutifully tending to the jungle goddess because she's damaged and begging to be repaired. What the film really wants to do is titillate its audience with the prospect of hot black on white sex. Whilst the entire film is shot with economy, using very little coverage, its famous sex scene is shot from every possible angle (and more if you buy the director's cut). The director wants us to leer at Halle Berry's model quality flesh, the film treating the audience to delightful little snippets of Berry's berries and pert little butt. End result white audience gets a slice of jungle fever, whilst passing it off as grief coping.7\/10 &#x96; How to win an Oscar? Have a privileged diva-actress lower herself to the dregs of humanity and recreate an ivory tower view of the downtrodden.

Sadly, he's not in the movie as either himself or Freddy nearly enough.It gets worse.

Marlon Brando is quite convincing in this early role. But the plot of the film is both true to the core and false to the bone. We are in New York, on the harbor, on the side of the dockworkers and the very strange atmosphere that existed in not so long ago a time and that may still exist in some harbors in Europe and the USA. To get a job, a daily job quite too often, short time anyway, you had to come in the morning to be selected in order to answer the numbers required by the bosses, in that case the authority of the harbor. These names were selected and called by the union itself. Such a power and the very comfortable income you can get out of it is of course captivated by some union leaders who look more like gang leaders than union leaders. And they accepted no dissent in the rank and file. Killing was even a game that brought some entertainment to those bored Mafiosi. Till one murder too many was done and performed on someone who had the heart of the dockworkers and a daughter who wanted him to be eulogized. That was enough to trigger an explosive situation, in which the local catholic priest is playing the good devil for these gangsters and the guardian angel for the dockworkers. Apart from that the film is rather trite. The end though is a marvelous piece of work. The defeated union leaders are rejected by a unanimous vote of all dockworkers in support of Terry Malloy who was the stake of the fight and thus vote with their feet against the already forgotten union leaders. But one detail may not be as visible as it should be. The dockworkers are able to walk to the ships when, and only when, the representative of the harbor authorities let them go through. In other words the gangsterized union leaders are only defeated because the harbor authorities say so. It is not class struggle but it is gang war and company within the union with the support that can change from one moment to the next from the bosses in the harbor. Do not think these practices are finished. Far from it. They are an everyday reality in some professions where the unions, or rather some groups of unionized people, have taken the control of the workforce. It is true in harbors, but also in airports and in train-transport companies, at least in Europe.
