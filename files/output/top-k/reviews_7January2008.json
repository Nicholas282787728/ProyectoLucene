First of all, the uniqueness of the story is what made me love seeing this movie over and over. The story of William Wallace has got to be the most heroic and captivating story I have ever seen. What amazed me is how from the beginning to the end, William Wallace fought for his freedom and for his love. He yearned for a peaceful life after years of war and misery, yet this wasn't a path that had been set out for him.This is all wonderfully brought into picture by Mel Gibson, who was the perfect match for a character such as William Wallace. The music in this movie has yet to be beat by any other score in another movie. It really makes you feel the atmosphere of Scotland in the brutal age this movie was set in. The combination of the breathtaking music, the Scottish highlands (Irish, Scottish, who notices the difference? D) and the epic battle scenes are one of the best things in this movie. I also think the character playing Longshanks deserves an honorable mention, he was just utterly fantastic in this movie.All in all, if you haven't seen Braveheart, I suggest you order the DVD, because you will be wanting to see it over and over again.

Monster flicks have been with us almost since the invention of the cine-camera. Their heyday was probably during the inter-war years when low price afternoon matinées required cinemas to screen serials that would fetch their patrons in again week after week, and led to many groups of B movies based on comic book or newspaper cartoon characters, often routinely battling against assorted monsters. At this time patrons did not expect too much - I am old enough to remember various 'monsters', mostly filmed courtesy of a perspiring actor in an inflated rubber suit, and today many younger filmgoers now happily watch these same films when they are periodically revived on late night television. But such simplistic fare soon loses its appeal, and modern monster films are better regarded as direct descendants of 'Jaws'. Since 1975 film makers have been continuously attempting to improve on Jaws - many of us would say almost completely without success. Jaws success was a direct consequence of the limitations of the animated model on which it depended. Mechanical problems are reported to have resulted in Spielberg abandoning most of the sequences where it had been planned to use it. For most of the film the monster which was so dreaded by all the cast was not to be seen. Human imagination can make the unknown even more fearful than the most dangerous of familiar creatures, and this that helped make Jaws an outstanding success. But later film makers - even after the production of Anaconda more than 20 years later - have consistently shown that they have still not learned this lesson also previously taught by the 1942 horror film Cat People. For good measure Anaconda featured two versions of the monster snakes - a traditional mechanical model and an early CGI version - both almost universally panned as being totally unbelievable. The film makers should have reflected that the Sherlock Holmes story The Speckled Band (Film 1931) provided a much more effective sense of menace even though the snake was small (a swamp adder) and was not actually encountered until right at the end of the story. An even more extreme approach is to make the threat come not from a monster but a creature with which the audience is very familiar and fully comfortable. Hitchcock did this first in his masterpiece The Birds. Similarly the ultimate limit of familiarity is found in Lifeforce which threatens us by a space alien who appears to be a totally normal human being, and is even introduced completely naked so that we can see she is not hiding any concealed threats. This is a far cry from a 40 foot man-eating snake. Clearly however most filmgoers only want a story they can identify with and be carried along by. With Anaconda both visual and logical inconsistencies, which could easily have been avoided to create a technically far superior film, were of no concern to them. Even poor acting and indifferent direction also appears to have been acceptable to most of those who saw the film.How does one rate a film when this is the situation. Film makers no doubt wish to create artistically memorable works, but ultimately this is not an easy business and most Studio executives would probably be prepared to admit that their chief objective has to be to create financially successful movies. Like the starving artist in his garret creating paintings which will become priceless 50 years after he has died, a few actors and directors may strive to maintain their artistic integrity regardless of cost, but we all have to feed our families and ultimately the acid test of a film is whether it can provide bread and butter to those who create it. Consequently they will not play a scene straight, instead of purely for some artificial effect, if this might reduce the popular appeal of their final product. The critic may deplore the result but it is hard to fault a product carefully designed to have the greatest possible appeal to the largest possible audience.To me this film 'bombed' totally - the external review by ....and you call yourself a scientist on this database summarises many of my reasons for this opinion in a way that I do not have space to do here. But I did not even enjoy 'Jaws' and should not have watched Anaconda. It too difficult to become involved in monster stories - the reality checks keep biting and I quickly become a passive and very uninterested onlooker although still able to assess whether they are artistically and technically well made. Whilst recognising that for many people both these films may have a very comparable appeal, for me Jaws was worth 8 stars, but Anaconda was worth no more than three. If viewed uncritically as a classic fun film (in the same way as a revival of a 1930's B movie monster film), Anaconda might rate not three but seven. Since I was not expecting to enjoy it, why did I choose to watch? Partly because I wanted to see the very under-rated actress Kari Wuhrer, and partly because I hoped many of the critical IMDb User comments might have been from viewers who were not used to watching European style productions and were being unduly critical - sadly this was not the case.

Sure there are plenty of films that have very few flaws, but they are not as complex as this movie, nor are their plots as brilliantly put together. Many people who dislike the film have called it boring and they do not like the ending. They forget the film is about a serious subject matter and shouldn't be handled like an action movie. Polanski, along with the rest of the cast, handle the story with maturity and precision, the way it should be. Polanski does not insult the viewers' intelligence. He forces us to use our imagination about past events and events that are currently happening. It may take several viewing to put all the pieces together, but with each viewing the film becomes more meaningful. Even though the film ends on an unhappy note, people must understand why the film ended that way. The ending is one of the reasons the film is so powerful and unforgettable. But that will be discussed a little later.'Chinatown' is the story of a private eye detective J.J. Jake Gittes (Nicholson) who investigates the extramarital affair of a prominent engineer in Los Angeles. It is set in the 1930s, and the city is suffering a major drought. Even though the city is going through a drought, Gittes discovers that thousands of gallons of water is being dumped at night. He is dumbfounded, but he does not realize he is about to enter a conspiracy involving the elite of the city. This conspiracy stretches out to the farmers in the surrounding land. He is warned on several occasions throughout the film about what he is getting into, but he still enters the lion's mouth full speed ahead. Jack Nicholson gives one of the great performances of his career. Even though all the actors did a superb job, including Faye Dunaway, Nicholson still towers above anyone else. There is a reason he is considered one of the all time greats. So few actors can bring such range into their roles. He is funny as hell when he needs to be and serious and sensitive the story requires it.The film is also carried by its brilliant screenplay. The screenplay has been hailed one of the best of all time, and I find that hard to argue. The dialog is so well written, it is an absolute joy watch time an again. Graphics can become dates, action sequences can become tame, but good dialog is timeless. Apparently, Robert Towne, the main screen writer, turned down 'The Great Gatsby' to instead write 'Chinatown'. He would have made a lot more money writing 'Gatsby', but inspiration won over dollars. He made the right decision because what he gave us was a screenplay for the ages. It is wickedly clever, intelligent, and cynical. Towne must have been at the pinnacle of his career.Many people have voiced their displeasure at the ending of the film. They feel it is depressing. They feel the film should not have ended that way. They feel that people have overrated the film because of the ending. To me, the ending is absolutely brilliant. It should rank as one of the great endings in film history. In the ending, the ghosts of the past coming crashing like a tidal wave. Notice in the ending, it is only time Evelyn and Noah Cross are together in the movie. Notice that in the ending, things are so confusing, hardly anyone can figure out what is happening. Throughout the film, Jake talks about Chinatown, or how he doesn't like talking about it. Jake really does not realize what he is getting into. What he is getting into is destiny. All the money or motivation in the world cannot stop destiny from happening. And this destiny is not always happy. In fact, it can be downright brutal. At times in this life, there are forces beyond one's control. What a phenomenal achievement in film-making.

I never really wanted to get into it, I mean, I was a kid after all. But a few years ago in my film appreciation class, we were watching clips from Mad Max 2 when studying Australian films and I was intrigued with it. I finally remembered a few weeks ago how I wanted to see the three movies, so I just watched Mad Max and I have to say that I understand it's cult following. Mad Max promises and delivers, it's a low budget action film, but has a terrific story and excellent stunts. Mel Gibson, before he was Mel Gibson in Hollywood, you could see why he made it so big, his presence on screen is truly hypnotic and he makes a great hero. This story is so scary in the fact that I don't think that we are far from this future.Max Rockatansky lives in a time where his country has been taken over by violent, vicious motorcycle gang members who just go around torturing and killing people. Max and a few friends are the last members of the semi police force that is trying to get things back under control and bring some peace to their town. But when the gang messes with Max's friend by nearly burning him alive, Max is ticked and goes after them.

I have heard good things about this movie, and decided to watch it on demand. The music is one of the many things that makes this movie work, along with decent performances by the actors involved, and disturbing scenes that seemed torn from an ancient past.A police officer named Sargeant Hardy (Edward Woodward) comes to an island village in search of a missing girl. The locals deny she ever existed and don't offer him much help. They aren't hostile per say, but you get a sense that something just isn't right about them. After discovering some strange rituals that go on which involve Pagan religion, Howie becomes suspicious and, being a Christian man an all, appalled and disgusted by what is going on. He continues his search for the missing girl using his authority as an officer of the law. He has an idea about what's happening, but never truly suspects where this trip to the island is really going to lead him until the shocking ending which I will not reveal.The folk music that opens the movie was perfect for a film such as this one. It fits in with everything that goes on. There are dance numbers as well, and one in particular involves Britt Ekland who plays Willow. This scene, which is rather unusual but surprising for a movie out in 1973, will become important to the plot of the film and the shocking journey that follows at the end.The scenery is eerie and though this film is not scary, well not until the shocking conclusion anyway, it is more of a mood piece that pulls you in and creeps you out instead. The atmosphere is creepy as well, and Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle is perfect in his role. He never appears terrifying, but you easily sense that there is a reason to be frightened of this man.The film is the director's take on two distinct and different religions. Edward Woodward as the passionate Christian fits the mold well. His distaste for Pagan religion feels completely genuine, not like that of a man just playing a part. You feel his anger and disgust. The island's inhabitants also fit their beliefs as well. They never appear to be actors, but a real society that might easily exist somewhere in the world.Weird, creepy, shocking. These words all fit as descriptions of The Wicker Man. The film is neither gory nor terrifying, but it will make your blood run cold anyway. Highly recommended.

There seems to be a fear when a great artist presents something that doesn't work, that critics are afraid to criticize it because they may reveal their ignorance. Picasso is probably the greatest example of this effect. The same thing seems to have happened with Baron Munchausen. It is big, the cinematography is first-rate, the production values and the actors are all first rate, but the film itself is impossible to follow. I have always been a big Terry Gilliam fan, and this was one of my biggest disappointments in a film I was sure would be brilliant. There were several very basic and fixable things wrong with this film. The first is that not everyone is familiar with the Baron Munchausen story. The script should have introduced us to the character and made us familiar with why he is a pathological liar who believes his own tall tales. Secondly, Neville, the actor who played the title role, never had acted in a movie before, and here he acts exactly as if he is on stage, complete with warbling old-age stage voice. Third, Gilliam lost track of what should have been the core interest of the film; the relationship between the hopelessly muddled old man and the little girl who cares about him despite his fabrications. Instead, that gets lost, and we lose the only thread of the story we care about. Possible Spoilers The point where we leave reality and enter his tall tales is not made clear, and the fact that the little girl inhabits his tall tales as he tells them, makes it even more confusing and muddled to the viewer. We don't know where we are, and if that is what the director intended, it is a mistake. After a while the audience gets disconnected from the film and we stop caring, because we get tired of being confused. The characters of the dwarf with sharp hearing, the world's strongest man, Eric Idle as the world's fastest man, and the guy who can see around the world are all superfluous. We don't know who they are other than their powers, what their relationship is with the pathological Munchausen, and why we should care about them. There is an absolutely tedious scene where Eric Idle does a silly dance to confuse Hephaestus (the god of fire) so Munchausen can escape, that goes on and on. The scene has absolutely no purpose and isn't funny, even tho Idle puts everything into it. It's painful to watch, and feels insulting to the audience to believe an Olympic god is going to be tricked this way. This movie reminds me very much of Yellowbeard, in the amount of great talent that is wasted. Gilliam told some pretty tall tales himself to get the movie made, misleading the studios into how much it would cost, then kvetched at length about having to cut down the script.

In this case, less expense, less visuals, and tighter writing would have been much more. The ending makes no sense and will leave the viewer with the full sense of confusion the rest of the movie induced.

Don Juan DeMarco isn't by any means my favorite Johnny Depp film or a great film, but it's a good one that I think had a decent story and is very watchable at least one time.

No one with a modicum of common sense would approach a movie like this and expect it be any good, in the strictest sense of the word. There are, however, at least two things which one expects to see in a cheesy slasher flick. The first is some serious gore, the second is boobies. Unlike most of the films in the Friday 13th series, this pathetic entry fails to deliver the goods on both counts.The plot is hilarious. It seems that, in spite of the savage murders that occurred at Camp Crystal Lake both last year and the year before (as well as the murders fifteen years earlier), yet another group of unsuspecting and apparently mindless teenagers go to the camp for a bit of fun and frivolity. In a huge twist, Jason returns from the dead - again - and starts killing them.As always, the first seven minutes of the film is just a replay of the last seven minutes of Part 2. One can't help but think that they were trying desperately to bump up the lousy running time, and they still couldn't make it to 90 minutes. If you think that's a rip off, keep watching.The only interesting thing about this film is that this is where Jason pioneered the iconic killer in a hockey mask look, having opted for a hessian sack over his head in the second instalment of the series. This is mildly diverting for about 30 seconds but is a long way from saving this turkey.The murders are all pretty tame here compared to the first two movies. Most of the violence happens off screen as the scenes all cut away just as the blade (or weapon of choice) is about to hit. We get to see the bodies afterwards, but there's nothing even remotely shocking about most of the shots here. The one exception is a body sliced almost in half (from the groin up), delicately balanced on a roof support beam. Personally, I couldn't help thinking what a lot of effort it must have been for Jason to lift the body up there and balance it just right, but by this point I was seriously bored.The real tragedy of this schlock-fest is that, despite the presence of some fairly hot (in an 80s way) teenage girls, none of them get their baps out. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure this is a flagrant violation of horror movie etiquette not to mention the fact that we had all come to expect some boob from this series as if by right! Ultimately, for me, this proved to be the last straw.This is a movie for die hard Jason fans only as it is easily the weakest in the series.

No one with a modicum of common sense would approach a movie like this and expect it be any good, in the strictest sense of the word. There are, however, at least two things which one expects to see in a cheesy slasher flick. The first is some serious gore, the second is boobies. Unlike most of the films in the Friday 13th series, this pathetic entry fails to deliver the goods on both counts.The plot is hilarious. It seems that, in spite of the savage murders that occurred at Camp Crystal Lake both last year and the year before (as well as the murders fifteen years earlier), yet another group of unsuspecting and apparently mindless teenagers go to the camp for a bit of fun and frivolity. In a huge twist, Jason returns from the dead - again - and starts killing them.As always, the first seven minutes of the film is just a replay of the last seven minutes of Part 2. One can't help but think that they were trying desperately to bump up the lousy running time, and they still couldn't make it to 90 minutes. If you think that's a rip off, keep watching.The only interesting thing about this film is that this is where Jason pioneered the iconic killer in a hockey mask look, having opted for a hessian sack over his head in the second instalment of the series. This is mildly diverting for about 30 seconds but is a long way from saving this turkey.The murders are all pretty tame here compared to the first two movies. Most of the violence happens off screen as the scenes all cut away just as the blade (or weapon of choice) is about to hit. We get to see the bodies afterwards, but there's nothing even remotely shocking about most of the shots here. The one exception is a body sliced almost in half (from the groin up), delicately balanced on a roof support beam. Personally, I couldn't help thinking what a lot of effort it must have been for Jason to lift the body up there and balance it just right, but by this point I was seriously bored.The real tragedy of this schlock-fest is that, despite the presence of some fairly hot (in an 80s way) teenage girls, none of them get their baps out. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure this is a flagrant violation of horror movie etiquette not to mention the fact that we had all come to expect some boob from this series as if by right! Ultimately, for me, this proved to be the last straw.This is a movie for die hard Jason fans only as it is easily the weakest in the series.

Pleading their innocence to an unsympathetic jury and public had got them nowhere, so they were left to fight for their freedom from the inside.As father and son Giuseppe and Gerry Conlon, both Pete Postlethwaite and Daniel Day-Lewis give passionate and outstanding performances as they struggle with both their failed relationship and the battle to prove their innocence.

After a successful re-release of the original STAR WARS trilogy, George Lucas has finally released the first prequel to his classic trilogy. STAR WARS EPISODE I THE PHANTOM MENACE, the first of three prequels to the original STAR WARS trilogy, was released in 1999, and instantly became one of the most talked about movie of that summer (it's also known to be The most anticipated movie of all-time since GONE WITH THE WIND perhaps) and also became the biggest hit of the 90's. One of the main attractions of course are the (expected) big-budgeted special effects, which are a breakthrough even for recent effects-laden hits like JURASSIC PARK and INDEPENDENCE DAY. The plot, which revolves around politics and government conspiracies disguised as Galactic annihilation, and characters were panned. True, the plot is sometimes confusing and the characters are a bit incomplete, but is this ever the strong point of the STAR WARS films? I think not. I for one put this criticism aside and enjoyed the film. Lucas has created a world here, and he fills every bit of it with startling discoveries and wildly imaginative visuals that will make you go wow.Since it is (chronologically) the first STAR WARS film, it gives us hints of the characters which will know later on in the following episodes. First we have a young Obi-Wan Kenobi, which will later be known as the wise Jedi Ben Kenobi, who is still a young apprentice to Liam Nesson's Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jin. There is also Anakin Skywalker, who would later be converted into the evil Darth Vader, who is just but a young boy with dreams of becoming a Jedi and a pilot. He is played by underrated Jake Lloyd, who may have slipped on some of his lines but has enough charm to play the young dreamer. Other characters who are introduced include Senator Palpatine, who would later become the evil Emperor, and those adorable droid duo R2-D2 and C3PO, which is but a bunch of bolts and wires. There was heavy criticism on the characters being pale and bare-bones. I think this criticism is overrated. We already know most of these characters, which will soon be more exercised and the later episodes. I think the point of THE PHANTOM MENACE is to introduce these characters. The characters are more like wine, the get better by age.An the plot? Well, it is convoluted and sometimes confusing, but I don't think the point of THE PHANTOM MENACE is not to create a political crisis version of a sci-fi epic. His point is to create some new things to give the audience a delight at the purchase of the movie ticket. Once again, Mr. Lucas succeeds in creating dazzling special effects, which aren't just terrific and innovative, it's also imaginative and wondrous. This are the best kind of special effects. You can create an explosion with many innovations on special effects, but if there isn't any imagination in it, it's worthless. The special effects in this film are innovative but imaginative. I liked that beautiful underwater villages, the terrific city towers of the planet Naboo, there is also the desert planet inhabited with various creatures. There is also an army of primitives fighting against an army of war machines created entirely of computerized images, not to mention the exciting pod race along rugged desert terrain. These dazzling and exciting visuals are a feast for the eyes, but they are also filled with awe and discovery.Granted, it is not as good as the original trilogy, but it really doesn't have to be to be a great film by its own account. Set aside the political talk and just let the visuals take you away from the limitations of a movie seat. I think it is a great film which is more enjoyable and entertaining to look at rather than to think about.Rating ****1\/2 out of 5.

I very much enjoyed it on its first release in 1994 and it stands up very well 13 years later. It's a strange thing really. The characters are a bunch of aging but immature unemployed hooray Henrys and Henriettas, thrown together originally in boarding school or at universities, now in their early thirties, still aimlessly partying their way through life. Charles (Hugh Grant) is terminally indecisive and the object of his desire, Carrie (an American), though beautiful, is lacking in self-confidence. I couldn't help thinking that the strong-minded Henrietta alias Duckface (Anna Chancellor) would have been a better mate for the feckless Charles, assuming he didn't mind being dominated.So why is this such a great comedy? First, Mike Newell, a very versatile director, has put it together beautifully and there is not a wasted moment. Second the dialogue is sparklingly fresh. Even 13 years later Charles's wake-up scene at the beginning still packs a punch. The scene at which Charles is trapped at a table with a posse of his ex-girlfriends is just hilarious. Third, although the characters are rather a shallow bunch they are still a good-hearted lot, and when one of them dies the mood changes dramatically. We wind up wishing them well, and the end of the film gives us their eventual matrimonial destinations. The minor characters are all well-drawn also.Richard Curtis, who was responsible for the script, is well-known for Blackadder (and Rowan Atkinson makes an appearance in this film), but the humour here is of a different sort. We recognise enough of ourselves in this bunch of upper-class twits to laugh along with them, as well as at them.I have only one niggle (shared with a lot of critics) and it is about Andie McDowell's performance as Carrie. It does appear wooden, in comparison with the others. If she is meant to be a pretty woman with no self-confidence, she does the job, sort of.
