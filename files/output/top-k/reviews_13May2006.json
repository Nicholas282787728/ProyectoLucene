The grand total of 2 people whose names I knew and the rest were faces I semi-recognized from other films or TV.I really can't see how the hooker was killed, she has something in the back of her head, obviously a drunken accident during frantic sex. Why they didn't call the police right away? Everyone apart from 1 man and the hooker were in the same room. They were all drunk. As soon as they start planning the cover-up they are incriminating themselves.Call the police, CSI go over the crime scene and work out what happened. The only person worrying about the drugs is the only person who took any. It wasn't murder but as soon as they start planning to cover it up and hide the body then they are committing a crime.They argue that long that Hotel security turn up. Legally he hasn't got the right to stroll in the room so the drugs he sees are inadmissible as evidence. Christian Slater then attacks him with a corkscrew (once he spots the dead hooker) and kills him so right now he's guilty of murder, drugs offenses & also conspiracy to conceal a crime.The idiots then clean up the crime scene, cut up the bodies and bury them in the desert.

It would have prevented all the crap that happened inside.Adam is succumbing to more paranoia at the wedding rehearsal dinner. Seeing as he was the only person who wanted to call the police from the 1st moment. The voice of sense, but calling the guy getting married (Mike) a murderer was a bit too much. It was an accident, wet floor, drugs, drink.Mike hitting the mini-van was totally pointless and lying to the police about arguing was also pointless. Killing Mike or is it Adam (we can't tell who is who, that's how easy the film is to follow. Especially with 2 actors who looks so physically alike) shortly after wards, utterly pointless. The film has gone from the stupid to the ridiculous.From here the whole religious aspect start getting a bit too intense. It just degrades into a bunch of Angry men shouting at each other, being too intense and fooling themselves into the illusion they did nothing wrong.The brother seriously over-acts unhappy at the funeral. Then another shouting match, the film is basically a large collection of shouting matches. The guy who died had left a note confessing to the whole killing of the hooker and security guy to his widow.They then lie to the widow telling her a modified version of the actual events.

I'd have been as far away as I could get from ANY water. I admit that scene with the shark pitching the guy in the stretcher against the window and breaking it was a bit far-fetched....the tank wasn't big enough to get-up that much speed, but it sure scared me ! Please wise-up the commentator who said those big sharks swam through those tiny doors they punched them in. Didn't you see the shark swim into the under-sea wreckage?

Half the plan works & Robin is whisked away but Peter manages to escape, he vows to find Childress & his son. Cut to 'Chicago 1978' & Dr. Jim McKeever (Charles Durning) is running the Paragon Institute for Childress, an institute that studies psychic abilities & tries to uncover people with these powers. Teenage girl Gillian Bellaver (Amy Irving) has been developing such powers & her Mother (Joyce Easton) agrees for her to spend some time in the institute in an attempt to help her. Meanwhile Peter is in Chicago & hot on the trail of Childress who becomes aware of Gillian & her powers which match Robins, Peter also knows about Gillian & the fact that she can help lead him to his son Robin. However Gillian & Robin start to suffer as they're powers grow stronger, it becomes almost impossible to control them...Directed by Brian De Palma I thought The Fury was a decent watch but nothing that special. The script by John Farris based on his own 1976 novel of the same name, which I have not read so I cannot compare the two although it's said that the film is considerably condensed, plays more like a thriller than horror for the first half, it sets up it's secret Government agency, the bad guy, the good guy, it has a few chases & even a bit of comedy relief in the shape of two bumbling cops & a new car. Then the film switches to more horror orientated territory with visions to sinister past events & psychic powers being used for evil & the two story elements come together at the end as Peter finds his son & Childress in a final confrontation type cliché. I thought the film dragged a little in places, too many elements just came & went too quickly & it ignores various aspects of it's story for long periods before going back to them which gave me the impression that it was was very inconsistent & at times a bit incoherent & confusing. It's never made clear as to why Childress is so interested in people with psychic abilities or what Government agency he works for. The story is complex, it's fairly engaging & gripping but at the same time it's rather dull & drawn out, I liked it for sure but I don't think I'd be in any hurry to watch it again.Director De Palma does a good job as you would expect from an accomplished director such as he. The Fury reminds heavily of Carrie (1976) with it's troubled teenage psychics which, by co-incidence or not, was the film De Palma made directly before The Fury. There is one sequence that inspired a few unintentional laughs though, the bit where Gillian breaks out of the Paragon Institute is played out in slow motion without any sound effects only some really awful & inappropriate music, it feels like it goes on forever. There's not much gore except for a cool bit at the end that looks like it belongs in David Cronenberg's Scanners (1981) when someone explodes all over the place, it's replayed several times in slow motion & from various different camera angles as well.With a supposed budget of about $5,500,000 The Fury is a very well made film & certainly has that Hollywood polish about it. One area where the film suffers from is that it has dated badly, the cars, the interiors, all the sharp suits & the latest 70's fashions tell it's own story. The acting was OK, I didn't think Irving was that good as Gillian but Douglas manages to bring a certain likability to his role.The Fury is a good watch, it's a bit long & a bit inconsistent but it entertains & tries to tell a thoughtful story. Definitely worth a watch if you have a couple of hours to spare.

It's never made clear as to why Childress is so interested in people with psychic abilities or what Government agency he works for. The story is complex, it's fairly engaging & gripping but at the same time it's rather dull & drawn out, I liked it for sure but I don't think I'd be in any hurry to watch it again.Director De Palma does a good job as you would expect from an accomplished director such as he. The Fury reminds heavily of Carrie (1976) with it's troubled teenage psychics which, by co-incidence or not, was the film De Palma made directly before The Fury. There is one sequence that inspired a few unintentional laughs though, the bit where Gillian breaks out of the Paragon Institute is played out in slow motion without any sound effects only some really awful & inappropriate music, it feels like it goes on forever. There's not much gore except for a cool bit at the end that looks like it belongs in David Cronenberg's Scanners (1981) when someone explodes all over the place, it's replayed several times in slow motion & from various different camera angles as well.With a supposed budget of about $5,500,000 The Fury is a very well made film & certainly has that Hollywood polish about it. One area where the film suffers from is that it has dated badly, the cars, the interiors, all the sharp suits & the latest 70's fashions tell it's own story. The acting was OK, I didn't think Irving was that good as Gillian but Douglas manages to bring a certain likability to his role.The Fury is a good watch, it's a bit long & a bit inconsistent but it entertains & tries to tell a thoughtful story. Definitely worth a watch if you have a couple of hours to spare.

Half the plan works & Robin is whisked away but Peter manages to escape, he vows to find Childress & his son. Cut to 'Chicago 1978' & Dr. Jim McKeever (Charles Durning) is running the Paragon Institute for Childress, an institute that studies psychic abilities & tries to uncover people with these powers. Teenage girl Gillian Bellaver (Amy Irving) has been developing such powers & her Mother (Joyce Easton) agrees for her to spend some time in the institute in an attempt to help her. Meanwhile Peter is in Chicago & hot on the trail of Childress who becomes aware of Gillian & her powers which match Robins, Peter also knows about Gillian & the fact that she can help lead him to his son Robin. However Gillian & Robin start to suffer as they're powers grow stronger, it becomes almost impossible to control them...Directed by Brian De Palma I thought The Fury was a decent watch but nothing that special. The script by John Farris based on his own 1976 novel of the same name, which I have not read so I cannot compare the two although it's said that the film is considerably condensed, plays more like a thriller than horror for the first half, it sets up it's secret Government agency, the bad guy, the good guy, it has a few chases & even a bit of comedy relief in the shape of two bumbling cops & a new car.

His cheeky, I'm so cute, don't you just love me looks, actually translate very well with this film. He is obviously playing an intelligent, driven, charming doctor, who most of the single (and probably some of the married) staff must be lusting after. Well, that would be if this move were directed by Sharon Maguire. Here, Michael Apted draws out a deeper, more complex Grant, who really comes across more as a highly driven, but slightly nutty young, inexperienced ER doctor. Still charming and likable, but with an edge that Grant is truly gifted at delivering.If you like Hugh Grant, or if you don't like Hugh Grant, you MUST see this film. It's got a fairly well paced excitement to it, that keeps you close to the edge of your seat, but without much intense action or gore. A truly well crafted suspense story.Veteran (bad boy?) actor, Gene Hackman, play very well against Grant. Even character actor Marcia DeBonis helps create the mood of intrigue. Sarah Jessica Parker's performance was the only slight disappointment. I believe she may have been mis-cast, as she is an excellent actor, who failed to really deliver in this film.I hope that this film is well received, and Hugh Grant's talents as more than a cool, good looking actor with an accent. From what I can see, we have only seen the tip of the iceberg as to what he is capable of. He is incredibly subtle, so its hard to see at times, but his development of the character Guy Luthan, ranks (in my view) as his best so far.I highly recommend this film, for anyone who appreciates an intellectual, mystery, chock full of real life intrigue that is highly accessible by the average bloke.See it!

Neil Page is one dry, too tight,suit-and-tie kinda guy that is trying to get from New York to Chicago. Unfortunately for him, the weather re-routes him and his plane to Wichita, Kansas. Simple enough right? It should be but it ain't because Neil has the misfortune of sharing the trip with a kind-hearted yet hugely irritating shower-curtain ring salesman named Del Griffith to help him on his way. From the moment these two meet in New York there are events that have to be seen to be believed. John Hughes is to be commended for making such a movie that you can watch again and again and never stop laughing from beginning to end. I think it is Hughes' keen eye for the Midwest that makes this movie so truly funny, very real characters at every stop that you can relate to and say, yeah, I remember a guy like that. Most of all, however, is Del Griffith, John Candy's greatest role. Del is someone who everyone has met in their life and probably try to avoid for the most part but Hughes shows a man that has an unreal ability for irritation but within that is a person that is truly a warm hearted, lovable and real man as well. The ending will make you teary eyed unless you have a heart of stone. The rest of the movie will have you memorizing lines like 'those aren't pillows', 'people train runs outta Stubbville' and Flintstones, meet the Flintstones. This movie was so overlooked at the time, a lot of it due to it's 'R' rating for a scene using the f-word 17 times, be warned, and consequently it may have lost a lot of audience due to that reason. As well, because it was a comedy, Candy got overlooked for a role that deserved, at least, a best actor Oscar nomination and that is no exaggeration. Ebert at least had the good sense to include this as one of the 100 greatest movies of all time and it certainly is that. In my opinion, the greatest comedy movie ever made.

Some moments from it - particularly the dream sequence - were still vivid in my memory, and I enjoyed it quite a bit...though it's undoubtedly the least of the major 80s werewolf films.The backwoods setting makes for a nice atmosphere throughout (and looks forward to another Stephen King adaptation, albeit a non-horror one, STAND BY ME 1986) and the love\/hate relationship between the teenage brother and sister - played by Corey Haim and Megan Fellows respectively - is like a breath of fresh air to the all-too-familiar proceedings. The make-up effects and transformation sequences by Carlo Rambaldi are good, if not quite in the same league as Rick Baker's work on AN American WEREWOLF IN London (1981; still my favorite film ever from this sub-genre, and that's some feat for a relatively recent title!).The werewolf attacks come thick and fast, though it's not overly gory - or even scary! Actually, the fact that crippled Haim is marked for assassination by the monster (in both its forms) associates the film more with the thriller than the horror genre! Still, like I said earlier, the hallucination of the local priest where he imagines his congregation turning into lycanthropes en masse is quite effective (if negating somewhat the eventual revelation of the monster's human identity!). Similarly, the fog-bound scene where the werewolf is hunted down by the angry villagers is straight out of THE WOLF MAN (1941) - were it not for its prevalent humor and the sheer cheek of having the lycanthrope take a baseball bat away from one of its 'predators' (a welcome but disappointingly under-developed role for 1940s tough-guy actor and notorious hellraiser Lawrence Tierney!) and proceed to beat him to death with it!! The later scene where the werewolf is blinded by a rocket fired by Haim also strains credibility, as does the climax with its nick-of-time retrieval of the silver bullet (while Gary Busey as Haim and Fellows' no-good and disbelieving uncle attempts to fend off the monster, but escapes unscathed despite being thrown around the place - rather than killed instantly, like the monster's previous victims - a number of times!)...

In recognizing that before I had seen it, perhaps I was disappointed because I expected more.What I found was a very confusing film, at least in the last third of the movie as everything started to be explained. It almost got ridiculous in the last 10 minutes when Dick Powell (Philip Marlowe) explained the whole story. He talked too fast and it was next to impossible to follow. I guess I will have to view this more often to understand it better, or find someone who can explain it for my feeble brain.The best part of the film was the cinematography, which really comes to life on the DVD. Someone did a very nice job restoring this film. That, and the general dialog by Powell, were fascinating. You could make a short book with all the wise-guy remarks made by Marlowe in this film - a lot of great stuff. I just wish they had made a simpler story and made it easier for the viewer to digest all the facts at the end.

She was killed in real life and it's dedicated to her memory. Anyway, I love this film. Of course, it's by John Hughes (master of teen angst comedies and dramas.) Again, he picks a great cast like Jon Cryer to play Duckie, James Spader to play the creep, Molly Ringwald to play Annie, Annie Potts to play her strange older friend, Harry Dean Stanton who plays Annie's father, etc. John Hughes always knows how to explain the adolescent psyche. This film is about rich and poor kids living together. There is this shame in the poor students and the rich kids are just spoiled brats. As always, John provides a believable love triangle among Jon Cryer's Duckie, Molly Ringwald's character, and that guy who I forget his name. Anyway, they are all great. I just have one problem and that is the fact we never understand why the mother\/wife left the family. Anyway, Gina Gershon has a small part in the film as well. Of course, it's about prom night which is an American ritual to all of us.

It simply entertains, which is what you want in a film. It's also well-acted by the two leads Hugh Grant and Gene Hackman.It's nice to see Grant in a serious role for a change while Hackman and David Morse are their usual intense selves. Also included in the cast are Sarah Jessica Parker, Paul Guilfoyle (of CSI-Las Vegas fame) and Debra Monk.BAD - My objections to the films are 1 - a few unrealistic scenes such as the meek doctor (Grant) beating up a tough FBI agent; 2 - the FBI guy (Morse) portrayed as a cold-blooded killer (boy does Liberal Hollywood hate any law- enforcement group); 3 - they also get a religious cheap shot in by showing the hateful bad guy at home with a picture of Jesus. The film world's bigotry never lets up.OVERALL - The unique story and the acting talents of Grant and Hackman make this worth seeing.
