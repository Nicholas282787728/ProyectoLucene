If the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in a nuclear war there would be no winners. Stanley Kubrick made a film about this impending doomsday. This was obviously a very serious issue so the film would have to be dark, dignified and grave. Or maybe it wouldn't. Instead it would be one of the most hilarious black comedies the world had ever seen. What to do when faced with the end of the world? Laugh.As the American president would later tell the Soviet premier an American base commander went and did a silly thing. This quite insane commander ordered his planes to attack the Soviet Union. When these planes drop their nuclear bombs the Soviet doomsday device will be activated and that for all intents and purposes will be the end of the world. Well that doesn't sound very funny. Oh, but it is. Kubrick played this dire situation for laughs and, helped to no small end by his amazing cast, created a comedic masterpiece.Everywhere you look in this film you see great actors turning in legendary performances. By virtue of the fact he played three different roles Peter Sellers gets most of the acclaim. And he is magnificent in all his various guises. He's the president, a British officer and Dr. Strangelove himself, a mad German scientist who has a hand with a mind of its own. Sellers was actually supposed to play a fourth role as well but that part, bomber commander Major Kong, eventually went to Slim Pickens. And while Sellers probably would have been fine in the part Pickens is simply perfect. A true-life American cowboy, patriot and total yahoo. Playing the truly insane base commander who starts the clock ticking to disaster is Sterling Hayden. It is a quite unique madness which afflicts this character and Hayden performs the role beautifully. Sellers, Pickens and Hayden are all fantastic. And there is a terrific supporting cast which notably features a young James Earl Jones. With all these great performances it would be near impossible for one man to steal the show. But George C. Scott comes really close to doing just that. He plays General Buck Turgidson who is ostensibly working to recall the American bombers but who quite clearly actually relishes the idea of mushroom clouds over Moscow. Scott's manic, over-the-top performance is comedic gold. His facial contortions alone are enough to induce side-splitting laughter. Scott may well be the best thing this film has to offer. And in a film this good that's really saying something. It's a film with a great story, great humor, great performances. Just for good measure Kubrick also tosses in one of the great movie sets of all time. How magnificent is that War Room? Do remember though that you can't fight in there.

It is fantasy fiction at its finest, and magnificently realized.Which sadly makes the few flaws it has all the more apparent.Mononoke has a theme of man vs. nature. However, instead of going the Avatar route, Mononoke presents both sides as fully fleshed out, and neither of them seems better or worse than the other. This is perhaps Mononoke's greatest strength real-feeling moral ambiguity where wrong and right are shady at best.Mononoke has also a multitude of other things going for it the animation and art are gorgeous, and don't seem dated in any way.

The first is the main characters they're believable and well developed, but there's an odd lack of emotion to them.

It clearly is there, why not go for it? The second, and biggest, problem with the film are its around last 45 minutes. In short, the whole story and all plot threads are solved in one long, intense action sequence which takes up most of the film's second half. The intensity is kept high for the whole time with little pause for breath, and eventually it does get tiring. I think it could have been done better. Also the ending feels quite abrupt after the long action sequence, as the what happened next? question is answered with only a few short scenes, and then we cut to the credits.

Beautifully shot by Vilmos Zigmond (although a few manipulated day for night shots look a bit wacky). The film moves at an even, moderate pace, without ever hurting the tension or drama. Thematically, it is an examination of the destructive nature of male machismo, the price of survival, the darkness of the human heart, the lies we're willing to tell ourselves and the world to get on, and the split between those of the land and those who use the land. These are not small themes, and sometimes they're a little too on the nose (e.g. dialogue like 'sometimes you have to get lost to find yourself' &#x96; although I'm not sure if the film is embracing that platitude or making very dark fun of it). At other times exactly what it's saying seems a bit fuzzy, or like it wants to have all its thematic cakes and eat them too. (Men need to be challenged to find their real self, but &#x96; on the other hand &#x96; trying to find your 'real self' may be an illusory path to your own destruction, literal or metaphoric). Also, I could see the people of Appalachia, who already carry understandable anger as being constantly portrayed as stupid, inbred and violent, taking offense to the film, and they'd have a point. Yet all that said, this is a movie that's more about a visceral experience than a collage thesis dissection, and that is where 'Deliverance' excels. It takes us to hell, and only partly back, and we get immersed in the journey in a way all too few films pull off. It is quite like being lost in a bad dream. And I mean that as a compliment.

The heavily anticipated disaster drama was action packed much like Bont's other films. Bont created Twister for anyone who loves to watch natural disasters unfold on the big screen. The movie had quite a few unrealistic scenes; however there were realistic ideas behind the actions. The script as well as acting is what lead to a very popular and exciting film.Twister in a nutshell is about two scientist\/ storm chasers meeting up to get divorce papers finalized. While husband Bill Harding is more concerned with ending his marriage to start another with fiancée, Dr. Melissa Reeves, wife Dr. Jo Harding is focused on launching a dangerous scientific machine (Dorothy) that will provide the scientist with never before developed tornado data. With the understanding of internal structures of tornados the scientist will be able to create an advanced tornado warning system. Along the way fiancée Melissa can't handle the exciting life Bill leads leaving husband and wife to tackle the storms together. After close calls and deadly storms the couple ends up sending sensors straight into the eye of the storm and rekindling a lost relationship.While parts of this action packed film are unrealistic the film is overall enjoyable for families, adults and children. Twister, in relation to director Bont's other film Speed had action unfolding during the opening of the film and never letting up, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats in anticipation. The film producers were able to produce new cinematography never seen before. The realism of the tornados created by new technology lead to this movie placing in one of the top ranked movies of its day. Compared to the graphic of today there is a noticeable improvement, but in the 1990's the realism of a natural disaster was unheard of. Director Bont creates moods and tornadic environments with the green, blue, and blackish coloring. Not only do the colors help the audience know its storm time but the wide verity of up tempo music leads into the scene as well. On the tail of one giant tornado the film's music ranges all the way from rock to classic, all setting the mode for the adventure filled chase.A tornado film had never been done before so at the time the technology seemed amazing, but if you exclude the graphics the film follows a pretty unrealistic path. Events such as a Dodge Ram truck staying grounded and surviving high velocity winds, while a semi barreled out of the tornado made me question the realism of the movie. During the film, lead actor Bill Paxton (Bill Harding) climbs into the back of a moving pickup while hail the size of golf balls come crashing down on top of him. Anyone who has ever been hit by hail knows just how much that hurts and standing in it for a period of time would be painful for him to stand.While the film contains unrealistic events it still has some realistic aspects that can be found in most movies. The films main characters whose job is to follow the tornados in order to collect helpful data do just that. The directors and producers worked hard at making their fast chases seem natural. The cast played these scenes particularly well and it seemed as if they were true scientist excited for the challenge. This film also contains a rivalry between two group of scientist and rivalry between two women pining for a man's love. The scripted bickering was completely believable and left the audiences rooting for scientist Bill and Jo. Not only does the script work in favor of a plausible story line, the main characters Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton create a chemistry that is also very believable. These actors played the parts to their fullest potential and if I had the choice to recast this movie none of the actors would have been replaced. Every part, major of minor played a role in creating the atmosphere and they were all spot on.Everyone was excited to see this kind of destruction on the big screen and the directors and producers exceeded expectations. In my opinion the unrealistic aspects didn't affect the quality of the movie and I think those who helped it reach second highest grossing film would have to agree as well. This movie will forever pop into my mind and the minds of others who watched when they hear tornado sirens blaring. Overall the film is enjoyable and one that everyone should see.

Halfway through the film you forget that the characters are German sailors, you forget about the Nazi ideology, you forget that the story is set in 1941 or even set on planet Earth. Wolfgang Petersen takes you to an alternate dimension, far away from anything we consider human, where there is no right or wrong and your only option is to kill or be killed. And the sensation of death draws ever closer, its certainty slowly driving every single man to insanity. The film is as much a world war 2 movie as Apocalypse Now is a movie about Vietnam.

Forster began his novel Howards End with the epigram Only connect&#x85;, words which have been interpreted as a plea for a greater degree of imaginative sympathy between people of different social classes and (just as importantly) between people with different attitudes to life. The book tells the story of three Edwardian families, the Wilcoxes, the Schlegels and the Basts. Although Leonard Bast and his wife Jacky are from a working-class background, there is not much difference in socio- economic terms between the other two families, both part of the well-to- do bourgeoisie. There is, however, a big difference in their outlooks. The cultured, artistic and intellectual Schlegels, of German extraction, represent old money. (Forster borrowed their surname from the Schlegel brothers, German writers and philosophers). The Wilcoxes, by contrast, represent new money. The father of the family, Henry, is a self-made businessman, and he and his three children are far more interested in business and making money than they are in culture or the arts. The Howards End of the title is the Wilcoxes' family home, a large farmhouse belonging to Henry's wife Ruth, who is more in sympathy with the artistic outlook of the Schegels than the rest of her family. She becomes a close friend of Margaret, the oldest of the three Schlegel siblings. In the meantime Margaret's younger sister, Helen, has befriended Leonard Bast, a clerk in an insurance company, who shares her reverence for high culture. (They meet at a lecture on Beethoven). The story then follows the complications arising from these two friendships. This film was the last entry in the cinema's great Forster cycle of the eighties and early nineties, a period which saw filmed versions of five of his six novels. It was the third adaptation of a Forster novel by Merchant Ivory Productions, following A Room with a View and Maurice. In my view it is, together with A Room with a View, the best film of the Forster cycle, for a number of reasons. The first is that the Merchant-Ivory style of film-making, with its meticulous concern for period detail and its gentle, unhurried method of story-telling, seems admirably suited to the works of Forster. David Lean's grand epic manner was never an ideal match for A Passage to India, a novel which, although it deals with political questions, concentrates on intimate personal relationships rather than the great historical events which formed the subject-matter of Lean's other late works. Charles Sturridge tried to imitate the Merchant-Ivory method in Where Angels Fear to Tread, but could never quite bring it off. The second is the remarkable number of great performances which James Ivory was able to elicit from his cast. The film only won one acting Oscar, Emma Thompson for Best Actress, but there were a number of other acting contributions of equal quality. Anthony Hopkins was perhaps not going to win a second Oscar so soon after The Silence of the Lambs the previous year, but to my mind he deserved Best Actor far more than Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman. (Whether he deserved it more than Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven is perhaps another matter). Hopkins succeeds well in his difficult task of bringing out the two sides of Henry's personality. On the one hand he is arrogant, snobbish and autocratic, but on the other Hopkins needs to imply a hidden, more likable side to him if the audience is to accept him as Margaret's husband. (The two marry after Ruth's death). Helena Bonham Carter was well-known around this period for her acting in period dramas; she had appeared in two earlier Forster adaptations, A Room with a View, and Where Angels Fear to Tread. There is a nice contrast between her Helen- passionate, impetuous and rash- and Thompson's calmer, more measured Margaret. Helen has a strong social conscience which Margaret seems to lack, and at first comes across as the more sympathetic of the two sisters, yet Helen's well-intentioned interventions in other people's lives can have disastrous unintended consequences. As for Thompson, she gives an object lesson in the art of portraying a quiet, reserved character without making her dull or uninteresting. Thompson and Hopkins were to act together in another Merchant-Ivory drama the following year, The Remains of the Day. Other excellent performances come from Vanessa Redgrave as Ruth Wilcox, James Wilby as Henry and Ruth's pompous, overbearing older son Charles and Samuel West as Leonard Bast. Bast is a tragic figure- he is clearly highly knowledgeable and intelligent, but because of his humble social origins is unable to put his intelligence to good use and is patronised and mistreated by those who consider themselves his social betters. He is also held back by his wife who shares neither his intelligence nor his aspirations. The third reason why the film works so well is the way in which it brings out the themes of the excellent novel on which it is based and makes them relevant to the 1990s (without ever labouring the point). The story might be set in the 1910s, yet its themes of the contrasting values of business and culture, of unemployment, of wealth and poverty, are still relevant even today. Henry Wilcox might be a figure from the Edwardian era, yet in 1992 his values would have seemed very familiar to those who had just lived through the boom years of the greed is good eighties. Leonard Bast recalls those who lost their jobs when that boom turned to bust. Even Helen, the woolly but well-meaning member of the liberal Guardian- reading classes, is a familiar figure to modern viewers. British heritage cinema, and the work of Merchant-Ivory in particular, is sometimes criticised as a mere exercise in sentimental nostalgia, with no relevance to modern times. Howard's End serves as the best possible refutation of that sort of criticism. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 November 2012","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" E.

British heritage cinema, and the work of Merchant-Ivory in particular, is sometimes criticised as a mere exercise in sentimental nostalgia, with no relevance to modern times.

M. Forster began his novel Howards End with the epigram Only connect&#x85;, words which have been interpreted as a plea for a greater degree of imaginative sympathy between people of different social classes and (just as importantly) between people with different attitudes to life. The book tells the story of three Edwardian families, the Wilcoxes, the Schlegels and the Basts. Although Leonard Bast and his wife Jacky are from a working-class background, there is not much difference in socio- economic terms between the other two families, both part of the well-to- do bourgeoisie. There is, however, a big difference in their outlooks. The cultured, artistic and intellectual Schlegels, of German extraction, represent old money. (Forster borrowed their surname from the Schlegel brothers, German writers and philosophers). The Wilcoxes, by contrast, represent new money. The father of the family, Henry, is a self-made businessman, and he and his three children are far more interested in business and making money than they are in culture or the arts. The Howards End of the title is the Wilcoxes' family home, a large farmhouse belonging to Henry's wife Ruth, who is more in sympathy with the artistic outlook of the Schegels than the rest of her family. She becomes a close friend of Margaret, the oldest of the three Schlegel siblings. In the meantime Margaret's younger sister, Helen, has befriended Leonard Bast, a clerk in an insurance company, who shares her reverence for high culture. (They meet at a lecture on Beethoven). The story then follows the complications arising from these two friendships. This film was the last entry in the cinema's great Forster cycle of the eighties and early nineties, a period which saw filmed versions of five of his six novels. It was the third adaptation of a Forster novel by Merchant Ivory Productions, following A Room with a View and Maurice. In my view it is, together with A Room with a View, the best film of the Forster cycle, for a number of reasons. The first is that the Merchant-Ivory style of film-making, with its meticulous concern for period detail and its gentle, unhurried method of story-telling, seems admirably suited to the works of Forster. David Lean's grand epic manner was never an ideal match for A Passage to India, a novel which, although it deals with political questions, concentrates on intimate personal relationships rather than the great historical events which formed the subject-matter of Lean's other late works. Charles Sturridge tried to imitate the Merchant-Ivory method in Where Angels Fear to Tread, but could never quite bring it off. The second is the remarkable number of great performances which James Ivory was able to elicit from his cast. The film only won one acting Oscar, Emma Thompson for Best Actress, but there were a number of other acting contributions of equal quality. Anthony Hopkins was perhaps not going to win a second Oscar so soon after The Silence of the Lambs the previous year, but to my mind he deserved Best Actor far more than Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman. (Whether he deserved it more than Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven is perhaps another matter). Hopkins succeeds well in his difficult task of bringing out the two sides of Henry's personality. On the one hand he is arrogant, snobbish and autocratic, but on the other Hopkins needs to imply a hidden, more likable side to him if the audience is to accept him as Margaret's husband. (The two marry after Ruth's death). Helena Bonham Carter was well-known around this period for her acting in period dramas; she had appeared in two earlier Forster adaptations, A Room with a View, and Where Angels Fear to Tread. There is a nice contrast between her Helen- passionate, impetuous and rash- and Thompson's calmer, more measured Margaret. Helen has a strong social conscience which Margaret seems to lack, and at first comes across as the more sympathetic of the two sisters, yet Helen's well-intentioned interventions in other people's lives can have disastrous unintended consequences. As for Thompson, she gives an object lesson in the art of portraying a quiet, reserved character without making her dull or uninteresting. Thompson and Hopkins were to act together in another Merchant-Ivory drama the following year, The Remains of the Day. Other excellent performances come from Vanessa Redgrave as Ruth Wilcox, James Wilby as Henry and Ruth's pompous, overbearing older son Charles and Samuel West as Leonard Bast. Bast is a tragic figure- he is clearly highly knowledgeable and intelligent, but because of his humble social origins is unable to put his intelligence to good use and is patronised and mistreated by those who consider themselves his social betters. He is also held back by his wife who shares neither his intelligence nor his aspirations.
