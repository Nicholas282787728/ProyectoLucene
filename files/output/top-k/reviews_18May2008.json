The story of an attempted suicide of a woman (Theresa Russell) and the following investigation where his boyfriend (Art Garfunkel) faces the suspicion of an obsessed detective (Harvey Keitel) is set in a Vienna filmed with taste and style and told in a non-chronological manner that builds the story in an a series of interleaved present and flashback scenes. The best parts of the movie are these where the actors are left to rather freely build the relationship of lust and mis-communication between Russell and Garfunkel, and the suspicion mind-game between Garfunkel and Keitel. Less convincing is the plot itself, it looks like after setting the story and putting the characters in motion the director and script writer did not really know how to end it at the level of interest they succeeded to build. Garfunkel itself in the middle of the story looks a little uncertain, this is by far his most important role on screen but his lack of confidence fits well a character who is supposed to look like he cannot make his mind in a relationship. Although this film came a little too early it set the rules and establish the ground for a niche genre that has developed a few years after it, and despite the aging of some gadgets and equipment and the intense smoking that looks now so outdated -) by its characters it does not look too tired or rusty, quite the opposite. Actually if I am to compare it with Basic Instinct (certainly with the second one, but maybe also with the first) Bad Timing is a better movie.

My all-time favorite.In the first place, it is not a huge, earth-shattering epic. It is a tiny little story, about a small handful of people. It doesn't have a life-changing moral. It is merely the most perfectly cut, perfectly polished gem Hollywood has ever produced.Humphrey Bogart is Rick Blaine, the burnt-out American who has found a place to die after his heart has died in Paris. He runs a saloon, living more from force of habit than anything else, and his granite cynicism makes him irresistible to others, men and women. When the love whose loss drove him to such despair returns, his mask cracks, and his agony is so wondrous to see. We get to watch his struggle, and he gives no hints as to his final decision until he announces it at the very end.Ingrid Bergman, as Ilsa, is, clichéd as it is, luminous. She so loves Rick, she so loves her husband. The scene where Victor, her husband, leads that stirring demonstration in Rick's, shows her face full of unadulterated adoration for him. What wouldn't I give to have any woman look at me like that! Her agony is beautiful. We all want her, and all wish we could be either of her heroes.Paul Henreid, Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Conrad Veidt, all gave such performances that they have become stereotypes.But I must pay worshipful tribute to Claude Rains. I think he has the very best lines in the movie. His cheerful cynicism, his unbridled lust, his proud greed, never bowing to the embarrassment of even acknowledging his naked hypocrisy, make him my favorite part of this great movie.This is the only movie I've ever seen I love more each time I see it. There are no great depths to plumb here, no hidden pieces of trivia for aficianadoes to find. Just a very nearly perfect story that is enjoyable time and again.Who's On First is the only comedy routine that is just as funny every time you hear it. Casablanca is the equally-miraculous movie, just as golden every time you see it, and maybe increasing in value with every viewing.You don't have to know a thing about the time. You don't have to remind yourself, as you do with Citizen Kane, that this is the movie that started all these things. It shines like a star. The perfectly cut, perfectly polished gem of Hollywood.

Not so much in the sense of how it looks, or how it is acted. More than anything the film stands out because it is a human drama that doesn't take a stance or one particular point of view. T. S. Garp is simply a man trying to live his life amongst all manner of eccentric characters and unlikely situations. And like life, things happen. People grow old. There are moments of joy. There are moments of tragedy. And people die.Robin Williams plays the title character known by most as simply Garp. His mother, played with dignified enthusiasm by Glenn Close, has brought him up all by herself. She is a nurse and during WWII, she used the sperm of a dying tail gunner who she happened to be caring for in his final moments. To call this woman a feminist would be a magnificent understatement. Her sexuality is never made that clear to the viewer but is is inferred by some around her that she is in fact a lesbian. Her only relationship with a man that we learn of is the encounter that produced her son, and she spends much of the film condemning the lusty ways of men and boys. As the film goes on, she becomes a famous writer and feminist leader. Garp spends much of his life trying to be a successful writer himself and raising a family, but he never seems to escape his mother's shadow.The plot simply follows the life of Garp and his family members. A great many things happen to these people over the span of many years. Careers are made, children are born, affairs are had, and the joys of life are often shattered by terrible tragedies. Williams is decent enough as Garp. He maybe acts a bit too zany in the light-hearted scenes, but he nails the more dramatic ones pretty well. That's the amazing thing about Robin Williams. The guy is an absolute nut most of the time he's in front of a camera, but when he bears down and plays something serious, it's stunning to see how great his range can be. He is an undervalued actor. Glenn Close steals this film though in terms of acting. She owns every scene she's in much like how her domineering character towers over that of her son's. The supporting cast is more than adequate with John Lithgow getting major props for his daring turn as a transsexual with a heart of gold. The film seems to take its share of jabs at radical feminism as it depicts a sect of women knows as the Ellen Jamsians. These women cut out their own tongues to protest the similar fate of a rape victim. And boy do these ladies HATE men. An act of violence in one of the final scenes shows how fanatical they can be. (as if cutting out their tongues wasn't bad enough!) Each person who views this film will probably see something different in it, and those are my favorite kinds of films. There are moments of definite humor, surprise, hope, and tragedy. You will not be bored. The film is based on a popular novel by John Irving and is worth 9 of 10 stars.The Hound.

The series was shown repeatedly on television and I could never resist watching it. For a casual viewer, few films are more entertaining. It has been several years since then and I have finally seen Raiders of the Lost Ark again. This time I was able to make some observations about what makes it so great.The acting is flawless. I'm tempted to say that Indiana Jones was Harrison Ford's career defining role. He is incredibly charismatic, honest, and iconic. There is not a single scene where he feels out of character. His heroic appearances always draw me straight into the film. His witty comments add a lot to the character. The rest of the cast almost matches Ford's quality. Marion Ravenwood (played by Karen Allen) makes a realistic and lively companion, often in extreme contrast to Indy's style. This makes for some intriguing development between them. Sallah (played by John Rhys-Davies) makes another good companion, although he is a bit one-dimensional. The villains are some of the most creative around. Dr. Rene Belloq (played by Paul Freeman) serves as the perfect nemesis. Although he claims to have a lot in common with Indy, some key characteristics are reversed (such as his ignorance of others). In addition, Major Arnold Toht is another unforgettable villain.The plot is very good. There are relatively few plot holes compared to other films that try to do as much. The events are unpredictable for the first time watching (well, except for Indy always escaping safely). The film alternates between riveting action sequences and slower plot development parts. This leads to some interesting pacing, which in my opinion is a success. The music score is varied enough to cover the entire range of situations while staying true to the adventure theme.The action is amazing. Everything is timed perfectly and executed with minimal inconsistencies. The film avoids simple punching or shooting action. Instead, it explores creative ways to maximize use of the surrounding environment. The climactic truck-chase scene is one of the best action sequences ever filmed.There are definitely some (but not many) better films, but Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the most accessible classics around. You don't need to understand symbolism, art, history, or filming technique to appreciate it. I can't think of a more complete adventure film. It also ranks among the best action films.

In DELICATESSEN, there were of course the weirdness and odd sets, but the story and acting was so much more important and this made me care much more for the characters. In CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, it felt more like I was gawking at a freak show and there was just no emotional involvement--none.In many ways, the film was reminiscent of several of Terry Gilliam's films--particularly BRAZIL. However, once again, BRAZIL had better characters and made me laugh. CITY OF LOST KIDS was just creepy and weird but with practically no charm.Now this isn't to say it's a bad film or that I didn't like it--I did. But instead of an involving or funny film, it was almost all visuals and weirdness. As for the plot, it sure took me a long time to even understand what was happening--and it seemed like I needed captions to explain the captions as I read along with the film!! But given the amazing sets and cool characters, it still kept my attention. I particularly enjoyed seeing Dominique Pinon playing a bunch of clones. I have liked this odd looking actor ever since I first saw him in DIVA and he was the best character in both this film and DELICATESSEN. His delivery and manner is just captivating.Now usually in most of my reviews I give a summary of the plot. Here it's very tough because I still am not 100% sure what I saw!! It all involves an evil genius who was created by one of the Dominique Pinons. This guy spends much of the movie kidnapping kids and trying to steal their dreams (kind of like an evil twist on MONSTERS INC.). At the same time, some evil freaks led by conjoined twins are thrown in as rival baddies. In the midst of this, Ron Perlman (who speaks no French in real life) and a little girl set off in search of Perlman's stolen little brother. There's more to it than that, but really I didn't think the story was that important--it was more a chance to give a canvas to all the weird sets and characters.Overall, I liked seeing the film but I never came close to loving it. I recommend it for those with an appreciation for the very weird and perhaps lovers of French cinema. All others, proceed at your own risk.

Compared with the other two, which are set in the 40's and 50's this one is supposed to be set on the turn of the decade, but for some reason it feels like present day, in fact it feels like it was shot at some awful party in the 1993. The Acting; Diane Keaton's characters in G1 and G2 are very weak, which suits someone who cannot act, in G3 she is supposed to be 'strong' against Michael but Keaton cannot pull this off, it also looks like she has been dressed by Celine Dion and had her done by Barbra Streisand in a Star is Born. Garcia looks like he stepped off the set of Greece and acts like Julio Iglesias would in a movie, like god's gift to woman, but for no reason, and also where the hell did he come from? Despite a lot of complaints about Sofia, I don't think her acting is her fault, she is given terrible material. D'Ambrosio who plays Anthony is a joke, when he was saying he wants to be a musician not a lawyer I cringed at the way he acted.

Some say the Wild West ended when the last famous outlaw Harry Tracy ended his career a little over a century ago, his Boot Hill being in a field about 50 miles west of Spokane, Washington. This movie takes place in Australia, which true enough, is some 8,000 miles west of the Mississippi, but it's also in the Far East part of the Eastern Hemisphere. And it's not your typical shoot-em-up either. There are no bank-robbing bandits, no gunfights on Main Street, no cavalry fighting the natives. But you'll find here a great coming-of-age romantic tale, with some stirring action sequences never seen before on film, all in the midst of some gorgeous location footage of the Snowy Mountains, which John Ford would have envied for his western films. This area of Australia, if one superimposed the map of the continental U.S. over Australia, would place the Snowy River country in about the same place as our Florida Everglades and not too far from where the Smoky Mountains begin in Georgia. Besides similar sounding names (Snowy-Smoky) this highest part of Australia contains its highest peak with an altitude very nearly the same as the Smokys' highest one in Tennessee, and a landscape that could pass for the southern part of the Appalachian chain as mentioned. Despite recent droughts and wildfires Down Under, the Snowy Mountains have changed little since Banjo Paterson wrote the poem on which this film is based and the equally memorable Waltzing Matilda, unofficial national anthem of that nation, in the 1890s. Paterson, by the way, is such a famous person even today, that his face appears on the Aussie 10-dollar bill. In contrast, the American sawbuck only has a guy whose greatest fame was getting shot in a duel. Sad to say, this film never did as well at the U.S. box office as other Aussie films like the Mad Max trilogy, which launched Mel Gibson to super stardom, and the even bigger moneymaking franchise of the Crocodile Dundee films. TMFSR never rated a single Oscar nomination (not surprising for a non-Hollywood film), but amazingly enough only won a single AFI award (the Australian Oscar) for its musical score. The Golden Globes, however, gave it a Best Foreign Film nomination, won that year by GANDHI.

If it had stood on its own it would have received a much higher rating.I understand why so many people here reviewing this film gave it top marks; it's action-packed, the acting is good, the storyline interesting, with excellent special effects and a dialogue that was filled with memorable quotes. But I can't help comparing it to the first film, and feeling that Aliens wasted an opportunity.In Alien it was suggested that once you leave the safe confines of the solar system, space can be mysterious and hostile in the extreme. Out there, species and technologies exist that are completely incomprehensible to us. Set against the grubby realities of pay disputes and faulty equipment, crew discontent and bickering, the sight of the utterly bizarre organic derelict is actually a real shock, and the subsequent appearance of an eyeless, brutal nightmare is equally stunning, and leaves you wondering just what else is out there lurking amongst the stars.In Aliens, the aliens become dumb canon-fodder, and have lost all the potential suggested by the first film's 'perfect organism'. In a way it took the franchise in the wrong direction, which we can still see repercussions of to this day with appalling duck-hunting that happens in AVP Requiem.This is a real shame because as one reviewer here said, Aliens is a great war\/action movie. It packs in some good storyline elements - the overconfident military summarily humbled; the inexperienced lieutenant falling in at the deep end; the wonderful interaction of the marines etc.But why waste the potential themes suggested by Alien by developing the story in this wise-cracking shoot-em-up way? Why not develop the alien as being potentially intelligent? Explore the connection with the derelict more?

I have, however, known about the film for quite sometime now, and all along, I have been aware of the fact that it's a sad one, so when I finally actually watched it after all these years, I had a pretty good idea of what to expect. Due to what I had heard, I had high expectations, expecting an excellent, touching, and sometimes heart-wrenching film. My expectations may not have been met completely, as I couldn't always stay into it, but in the end, it still struck me as a great film! Set in Victorian England, Dr. Frederick Treves is a surgeon who works in the London Hospital. At a circus freak show, he sees John Merrick, known as the Terrible Elephant Man, who is severely disfigured from a rare disease, and treated very poorly as a side-show freak. Treves is fascinated, and has Merrick sent to the London Hospital, where he studies his deformities and gives a lecture to his colleagues about them. Afterwards, Merrick returns to his owner, Bytes, who beats him severely and injures him! Treves is then called back over and told that Merrick fell. The surgeon soon takes the severely deformed man back to the hospital, where he gradually learns that his patient is surprisingly intelligent. Merrick is treated much better in the hospital, but Treves brings him a lot of publicity as his patient, causing the surgeon to wonder if he is any better than those who exploited Merrick in the circus! I have read about some inaccuracies in this film, which doesn't surprise me at all. Even though some criticise The Elephant Man for that, I've learned to expect it from movies based on true stories. I know that his name was actually Joseph Merrick, not John, though he is widely known as John, apparently due to Treves' memoirs for some reason. I know there are more significant inaccuracies, and probably significant things about Merrick's life left out as well. However, Merrick apparently was a very nice, intelligent individual who lived a sad life, facing discrimination just because of his deformities, which is all shown in this movie. This is what makes the movie so heart-wrenching at times (as I'm sure the true story was), seeing such a kind-hearted individual mistreated and living such a sad life. I know my eyes watered a bit a couple times! I'll admit I certainly wasn't moved by the entire film. Like I said, I couldn't always stay into it. This was mainly at certain times early on. I could have stopped the film, but I eventually found that forcing myself to keep watching was the right thing to do, as the story got so interesting that I couldn't stop watching! The Elephant Man is not the fastest-paced film ever made, and has somewhat limited musical score, which I'm sure could make it hard for some to watch, but overall, it is still a very well made, touching, and memorable biopic that shows what an unfortunate world we live in, where such kind-hearted people can be treated so cruelly for something they can't do anything about, and how you should not judge one by their appearance.

It cuts both ways; the happy group inside the lighted window, the figure in the long grass in the orchard seen from the train stay and support us in our dark hours. One-Hour Photo is a film about someone who invests almost all of himself in other people's lives. Sy Parrish works behind the photo counter of a large suburban supermarket and has spent the last twenty years of his life developing other people's snapshots. Sy is a lifelong bachelor, with no wife, family or romantic interest in his life. His one passion seems to be for his job, which he takes very seriously, doing his utmost to ensure that every customer receives a perfect set of photographs. He prides himself that his laboratory is the best mini-lab in the state, and his philosophy can perhaps be summed up in the following words- And if these pictures have anything important to say to future generations, it's this I was here. I existed. I was young, I was happy, and someone cared enough about me in this world to take my picture. Sy might seem like the perfect employee, but there is a darker side to his character. He has formed a great attachment to one particular family, the Yorkins- handsome dad Will, pretty young mom Nina and their cute young son Jake. He does not just see the family as customers- he has befriended them and appointed himself their Uncle Sy. What the Yorkins do not know is that Sy has, over a number of years, been making an extra copy of every photograph they have brought in to him to develop and has been using these copies to decorate his flat, where he has several hundred images of them stuck to one wall. In Sy's eyes the Yorkins are the family he never had, his one source of happiness in his humdrum existence. And then, suddenly, his life changes. He is sacked from his job and- even worse for his peace of mind- discovers that Will is cheating on Nina with another woman.The film, superficially, falls within the stalker genre which was popularised in the late eighties and early nineties by films like Fatal Attraction and Single White Female. When Sy discovers that his adopted family are less perfect than he had imagined, the emotional world he has constructed for himself is destroyed, and he decides to seek revenge. Unlike many stalker films, however, One Hour Photo contains a strong satirical element; it can be seen as a satire on suburban life not unlike American Beauty. The Yorkins are an All-American suburban family so eerily perfect they could be taken straight out of a commercial. Although the film was shot in the Los Angeles area, the identikit homes and shopping malls could be set in the suburbs of virtually any American city. This idea of suburban conformity is emphasised by the film's bland and impersonal visual look. We can all think of films (Girl with a Pearl Earring and Far from Heaven are two recent examples) where virtually every shot looks like a painting. One Hour Photo, with its hard, glossy look and vivid primary colours is a film where virtually every shot looks like a family snapshot. What surprised me most about this picture was not seeing Robin Williams playing a villain, as I had previously seen him in Insomnia (also made in 2002) and as a fanatical anarchist in The Secret Agent. What surprised me was seeing Robin Williams playing an introvert, as I had always associated him with brash extroverts, such as the motormouth DJ Adrian Cronauer in Good Morning Vietnam, or the inspirational teacher in Dead Poets Society, or the eccentric actor who disguises himself as his own children's nanny in Mrs Doubtfire. Here, however, he is completely different. Sy is the archetypal grey, anonymous little man, a reclusive, working-class, middle-aged bachelor, hardly noticed by the rest of society. His name Sy is not short for Simon but rather Seymour, a pun on see more. Others may overlook him, but his job enables him to see rather more of their lives than they might wish, and it is this which gives him a surprising amount of power. Even though this part is so different from the sort of roles I have come to associate with Williams, it is nevertheless one of his best. Unlike some characters in stalker films, Sy is never allowed to appear simply as a villain. He may be a creepy, dangerous obsessive, hovering on the brink of madness, but we are never allowed to forget that he is human. Williams and writer\/director Mark Romanek portray him with sympathy and compassion. He is perhaps one of the casualties of the suburban lifestyle, a man whose obsessions have their roots in loneliness and in alienation from the privileged, seemingly picture-perfect lifestyle of families like the Yorkins. Watching Williams's brilliant portrayal of this alienated loner, the question that came to mind was the one originally posed by the German writer Hans Fallada in 1932, one year before Hitler's rise to power, Kleiner Mann, was nun? Little man, what now? 8\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"18 May 2008","score":"","review":" In her novel The Death of the Heart Elizabeth Bowen wrote Not for nothing do we invest so much of ourselves in other people's lives- or even in momentary pictures of people we do not know.

It cuts both ways; the happy group inside the lighted window, the figure in the long grass in the orchard seen from the train stay and support us in our dark hours. One-Hour Photo is a film about someone who invests almost all of himself in other people's lives. Sy Parrish works behind the photo counter of a large suburban supermarket and has spent the last twenty years of his life developing other people's snapshots. Sy is a lifelong bachelor, with no wife, family or romantic interest in his life. His one passion seems to be for his job, which he takes very seriously, doing his utmost to ensure that every customer receives a perfect set of photographs. He prides himself that his laboratory is the best mini-lab in the state, and his philosophy can perhaps be summed up in the following words- And if these pictures have anything important to say to future generations, it's this I was here. I existed. I was young, I was happy, and someone cared enough about me in this world to take my picture. Sy might seem like the perfect employee, but there is a darker side to his character. He has formed a great attachment to one particular family, the Yorkins- handsome dad Will, pretty young mom Nina and their cute young son Jake. He does not just see the family as customers- he has befriended them and appointed himself their Uncle Sy. What the Yorkins do not know is that Sy has, over a number of years, been making an extra copy of every photograph they have brought in to him to develop and has been using these copies to decorate his flat, where he has several hundred images of them stuck to one wall. In Sy's eyes the Yorkins are the family he never had, his one source of happiness in his humdrum existence. And then, suddenly, his life changes. He is sacked from his job and- even worse for his peace of mind- discovers that Will is cheating on Nina with another woman.The film, superficially, falls within the stalker genre which was popularised in the late eighties and early nineties by films like Fatal Attraction and Single White Female. When Sy discovers that his adopted family are less perfect than he had imagined, the emotional world he has constructed for himself is destroyed, and he decides to seek revenge. Unlike many stalker films, however, One Hour Photo contains a strong satirical element; it can be seen as a satire on suburban life not unlike American Beauty. The Yorkins are an All-American suburban family so eerily perfect they could be taken straight out of a commercial. Although the film was shot in the Los Angeles area, the identikit homes and shopping malls could be set in the suburbs of virtually any American city. This idea of suburban conformity is emphasised by the film's bland and impersonal visual look. We can all think of films (Girl with a Pearl Earring and Far from Heaven are two recent examples) where virtually every shot looks like a painting. One Hour Photo, with its hard, glossy look and vivid primary colours is a film where virtually every shot looks like a family snapshot. What surprised me most about this picture was not seeing Robin Williams playing a villain, as I had previously seen him in Insomnia (also made in 2002) and as a fanatical anarchist in The Secret Agent. What surprised me was seeing Robin Williams playing an introvert, as I had always associated him with brash extroverts, such as the motormouth DJ Adrian Cronauer in Good Morning Vietnam, or the inspirational teacher in Dead Poets Society, or the eccentric actor who disguises himself as his own children's nanny in Mrs Doubtfire. Here, however, he is completely different. Sy is the archetypal grey, anonymous little man, a reclusive, working-class, middle-aged bachelor, hardly noticed by the rest of society. His name Sy is not short for Simon but rather Seymour, a pun on see more. Others may overlook him, but his job enables him to see rather more of their lives than they might wish, and it is this which gives him a surprising amount of power.

But the movie needs to be carried by Cusack and whenever he was on screen I tended to lose interest. At a macro level this is a cautionary tale about trying to turn one's passions into a business.

Trouble starts with Mona Demarkov (Lena Olin), a Russian hitwoman (or so says the IMDb synopsis says) that Falcone wants dead and the cops want alive to bring down Falcone (I think). Grimaldi is caught in the middle, but Mona offers him a solution to play them both and get away with a lot of money.The acting is solid all around. Gary Oldman is solid as Grimaldi. Oldman is not afraid to show a wide spectrum of emotion, and that's what makes him great here. Lena Olin gives promise as a complete psychopath, but strangely Mona isn't as developed as she could be. Still, Olin does what she can with what she has, and Mona is uncannily like Catherine Trammell in Basic Instinct (except that when compared to Mona Demarkov, the Sharon Stone character has the viciousness of a housecat). Anabella Sciorra is terrific as Grimaldi's wife, but again, she's not that developed. The only actor that doesn't work is Juliette Lewis as Grimaldi's lover. Lewis seems out of place in this role, but fortunately her character isn't on screen very much.Romeo is Bleeding has a great noirish atmosphere, complete with the soft jazz soundtrack.

It's really hard (if not impossible at times) to figure out what is going on. Hence my troubles.Here is what's clear. Jack Grimaldi (Gary Oldman) is a corrupt cop who plays both sides of the battle between the cops and the mob, run by Don Falcone (Roy Scheider). Trouble starts with Mona Demarkov (Lena Olin), a Russian hitwoman (or so says the IMDb synopsis says) that Falcone wants dead and the cops want alive to bring down Falcone (I think). Grimaldi is caught in the middle, but Mona offers him a solution to play them both and get away with a lot of money.The acting is solid all around. Gary Oldman is solid as Grimaldi. Oldman is not afraid to show a wide spectrum of emotion, and that's what makes him great here. Lena Olin gives promise as a complete psychopath, but strangely Mona isn't as developed as she could be. Still, Olin does what she can with what she has, and Mona is uncannily like Catherine Trammell in Basic Instinct (except that when compared to Mona Demarkov, the Sharon Stone character has the viciousness of a housecat). Anabella Sciorra is terrific as Grimaldi's wife, but again, she's not that developed. The only actor that doesn't work is Juliette Lewis as Grimaldi's lover. Lewis seems out of place in this role, but fortunately her character isn't on screen very much.Romeo is Bleeding has a great noirish atmosphere, complete with the soft jazz soundtrack. It's a throwback to the noir movies of the 40's, even though it's in color (director Peter Medak uses this to his advantage). It would be a great movie if the story had any coherence.
