That's why I was quite taken aback by how much of a turd Any Given Sunday is. It's the story of fictional NFL team the Miami Sharks. Al Pacino is the team's head coach who is trying to desperately to take them to the playoffs, but to do so he must battle against unnecessary roughness on and off the field. Dennis Quaid plays the teams star quarterback who, after a nasty hit, is put out of the game and replaced by Jamie Foxx who somehow becomes a superstar after winning just two games, because that's how the NFL works, right? Turmoil continually befalls the team as they try to keep it together so they can go all the way and have the season of a lifetime.What I love about Oliver Stone is the way he can take something we've seen plenty of times before and make it into something highly original and absolutely brilliant. He changed the face of war movies with his robust shout out to the troops in Platoon. He took a rock and roll biopic and turned it into an existential masterpiece with The Doors. He allowed the presidential biopic to soar to new heights with JFK. So his attempt at a football movie should have been revolutionary. But instead we are given this sappy, cheesy, poorly written, poorly directed stinker of a film. What the hell happened? Any Given Sunday is just one big melting pot of clichés. There is absolutely nothing original here for a football film. You might not realize it, but you know the entire plot of the film before you ever hit play. I'm not sure that this film get any more obvious. It is the complete package of typical football film story lines. You have the tormented coach who can't keep his team together. The all-star quarterback who gets injured, letting the far superior rookie play. Said rookie is an egomaniac who can't get his life together because of the excess of fame. But of course a few inspirational speeches from coach and the whole team is golden once again. The flat lining lack of originality in this film is appalling.However, what's even more appalling is Oliver Stone's god awful direction. This film is so sporadic and lacks any kind of structure to its editing. We are constantly barraged by quick cuts that do nothing but distract and quickly become very annoying. The look of this film is supposed to seem fun and artistic, but really it is just pretentious. Stone is trying to do something talented with the direction here, but it doesn't work at all and only gets in the way. There is hardly a shot in this film that lasts for more than 30 seconds. The camera will be focused on one person as they deliver a monologue, but the camera constantly changes angle on them, jumping from spot to spot on their face which gets ridiculously annoying. Stone has displayed such finesse and such raw talent for direction in the past. I really don't know what happened here.Any Given Sunday is easily one of the biggest wastes of close to three hours of my life. It's a truly terrible film that lacks any kind of control, structure, meaning, or purpose. Al Pacino does a nice job while the rest of the cast are pretty sorry. A football film from Oliver Stone should stand out amongst all other football films, but instead this film just takes every football film cliché and applies that to itself, never raising the bar of originality. The only reason this film would stand out amongst others like is would be because it is so horrible. I never thought I'd say this about an Oliver Stone film but... I hate this film.

But lets be honest, this movie is not bad at all, especially not when compared to other similar genre attempts.Still they did plenty wrong with this movie and made some serious bad steps. First of all; its settings. The jungle playground has this time been replaced by a large city. Yes, I get it, the city is often regarded as an asphalt and concrete jungle but that is just a figure of speech, no need to take it as literally as they did in this movie. Its settings already take so much away from its concept, that still made the first movie such a strong one.But also the hunting game of the Predator himself seems to have changed this time. Yes, this in itself is also partly due to the fact that it's being set in Los Angeles, that of course is being inhabited by millions of people. How can you effectively play an hunting game in it? No matter were you go, there are always people, so it's easy to kill. And that also seems what the Predator is doing in this movie; he just randomly kills people, without really toying with them first, or put any real effort into it. This takes away so much of the tension already and is part of the reason why this movie really isn't half as effective as the first movie.But what perhaps even more troubled me was that the roles were more or less reversed this time. The main character is after the Predator, instead of the other way around. As a matter of fact, the predator doesn't even seem aware of the Danny Glover character, until half way through or so. Because of this the movie for large part is lacking a real sense of danger, which again, takes away so much of the movie its tension.Another mistake they made was that they showed the Predator way too early on. He's in the first few minutes of the movie and gets fully shown, pretty much right away. The Predator is supposed to be a, literally, invisible hunter, who strikes out of nowhere. No need to show him all the time, in order to make him a scary killer and monster. They really wanted to show off way too much with the Predator this time and all of his cool new weapons.Typical sequel stuff. It tries to desperately to be bigger and better than the first movie, while it's actually involving a totally different cast and crew this time, which already makes this feel like a totally different movie from the first one. I'm not saying that John McTiernan (the director of the first movie) is a brilliant director but his touch was perfect for Predator, while Stephen Hopkins is a director who has basically never surpassed the level of average, with any of his movies.But that's all the negative stuff. The movie still has plenty of redeeming qualities in it. The story is quite weak but at least it's entertaining and ensures that the movie never becomes a boring one. There is plenty happening and the movie also has some amusing and good characters in it, played by some fine actors. Yes, Danny Glover, Gary Busey, Bill Paxton and Robert Davi all play some very typical roles for them but that's simply what they are good at and is why their characters work out and become entertaining ones.

I wasn't around in the early 1940s, but did live a town of about 3000 in the late sixties and early seventies, fifth through twelfth grade, and this was nothing like real life, especially with the characters. The characters in the movie all come across as very civil to each other, like a happy family, and that's a pipe dream. Not a single believable scene in the entire movie. Very disappointing.The movie is very predictable, even for 1971. It also lacks coherence for the first half. We don't know who is who, or what they are doing. It is confusing and looks botched.Sometimes confusion is good, or okay, but since this is a drama, a story, it comes across as poor directing and\/or writing, which it is.The story is just a poor story. The only ones who seem to have any soul at all are the ones who are called slow or retarded.

This one came close, but not quite, so it rated a 4.Too bad, because a film about nostalgic eras, about small town life, should have been much better. We're given the huge quantity here of a big budget, mostly good acting, small details paid attention to, but no quality of writing or directing. Typical seventies preaching.Mildly disappointing.

No, it's a Superman movie starring Richard Pryor.

(See what I mean about taking it seriously?) Though Pryor is surrounded by now-veteran SUPERMAN co-stars, Doug McClure (as Jimmy Olsen), Margot Kidder (as Lois Lane), Jackie Cooper (as Perry White) and A-Listers Robert Vaughn (as the villain) and talented comedienne Pamela Stephenson (as the villain's T&A, who does nothing more than minimally expose her T&A), he alone saves the movie from descending to the Ninth Level of Hell with his inimitable patsy turn as a computer hacker hired by Vaughn for evil ends.Christopher Reeve is once again the Man of Steel and is given such an abominable script to work with - coupled with the worst and cheapest flying effects you will ever see - that wearing his neon blue and red duds out in public is starting to look exceptionally gay.Gone is the slick production value; gone is the tagline You'll believe a man can fly because when you watch SUPERMAN III, you're pretty sure a man can't fly and that he's being levitated by guy wires attached to a crane. Gone is the majestic music - Ken Thorne is only allowed minimal snatches of John Williams's grand theme, the rest of the soundtrack consisting of slapstick toodles to accompany director Richard Lester's supposedly uproarious slapstick action. To call the opening credit sequence a third grader's idea of comedy is a compliment.The references to computers (in their boxy housings with big qwerty keyboards and green text on black screens) will look especially dated to youngsters; the acting will make you want to kill your pet, the audio looping will make you want to slap your child, and when Superman goes bad we see that his idea of badness is as juvenile as his idea of goodness...I've said this before with the powers that Superman possesses, he shouldn't even THINK about bank robbers or people falling down and hurting themselves - this guy should be dealing with crime at the highest corporate levels, the white collar crime that CREATES low level crime by creating economic social rifts.But who is really paying attention when his undies are so bright and tight? By the mid-1980s, Superman comicbooks had been developing story lines and character over 50 years - yet this third modern SUPERMAN movie still retains the provincial mentality of the 1950s.Superman is handed pseudo-kryptonite by Richard Pryor (doing his best General Patton - one of the films three great laughs) which doesn't kill him, but makes him do bad things straightens out the Leaning Tower of Pisa, blows out the Olympic torch, punctures an oil tanker, and gets drunk. You know, true evil. Oh, and he almost grows a three-day shadow, the universal stamp of sexy Euro villains. And when he has the opportunity to slam Pamela Stephenson atop the Statue of Liberty, he accedes to doing her a favor first in return for her sexual favors! Yeah, badness like Mister Rogers.It takes an hour for the film to reach this semi-interesting point - and then it goes nowhere with the concept. Superman merely splits into two people - himself and Clark Kent - and battles soporifically with himself in a junkyard, raising the film almost to the level of boring. Clark Kent triumphs.

An ultra-conservative Jerry Falwell-type politician, who predicted the earthquake, has exploited his good fortune to win the presidency for a lifetime in the next election. He rewrites the laws so that he can hang on to the post for life then relocates the nation's capital to Lynchburg, Virginia. A new morally white-washed America has emerged by the year 2013. Cursing, smoking, pre-marital as well as extra-marital sex, and eating red meat now constitutes crimes. The government deports anybody who doesn't conform and sends them to the gang-infested cesspool of Los Angeles. The U.S. Police Force maintains a chain of forts along the coastline to repel the efforts of a South American revolutionary, Cuervo Jones (George Corraface of Christopher Columbus), who plans to spearhead a Third World invasion to reclaim America. Things take a turn for the worse when the President's naive daughter Utopia (A.J. Langer) steals the black box. The black box contains the remote control to activate a necklace of lethal satellites designated 'the Sword of Damocles.' These satellites encircle Earth, and they can fire a magnetic pulse beam with pinpoint accuracy that can disable any kind of electric engine. Utopia hijacks Air Force 3 and the jetliner crashes in L.A. She allies herself with Cuervo Jones who threatens to use the weapon against America. The U.S. Police Force dispatches a rescue team, but all die. Enter 'war hero' Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell of Tombstone), unshaven, sporting a black patch over his left eye and his typically surly attitude toward authority in general, in handcuffs with a police escort. The only thing Snake seems to be interested in is where he can get his next cigarette. The police infect Snake with a deadly virus that gives him less than ten hours to retrieve the black box. Reluctantly, Snake agrees to take the mission and rides a nuclear mini-sub into Los Angeles.Snake shares the sentiments of Marlon Brando's motorcycle maverick from The Wild One. When asked what he rebels against, Brando's black-leather clad biker replies What have you got? Whatever it is, Snake is against it. Snake thumbs his nose at the rules and the rule makers. He is the ultimate anti-hero, sent to save a civilization that he abhors. Former Disney star Kurt Russell reprises the tough guy tongue-in-cheek role he created in Escape from New York. No, you don't have to have seen the original to appreciate Escape from Los Angeles. His fastidious performance boasts equal amounts of put-on and posturing. Russell delivers his dialogue in a low, rasping monotone that parodies Clint Eastwood's 'Man with No Name bounty hunter character. Snake resembles a fashionably rode-hard but put-up-wet Marvel Comic super hero clad in skin-tight, black garb, with matching pistols. Nevertheless, Snake hardly qualifies as a super hero. The filmmakers have a great time poking fun at their one-eyed protagonist. Instead of calling him 'blue eyes,' they refer to him as 'blue eye.' Everybody who comes into contact with Snake for the first time expresses surprise that Snake isn't taller. Snake acts rather gullible on occasions when he has to depend on characters who double-cross him.While the first Escape represented a triumph of style over substance, the Escape sequel triumphs both in style and substance. Escape from New York attained classic cult status as a darkly comic, industrial-strength escapade where Snake rescued a U.S. President from a grim maximum security prison on Manhattan Island. The story generated at least a modicum of tension because Snake had to contend with the severe time restriction. He had been injected with a poison that would kill him if he failed to accomplish his mission by its deadline. Strictly a follow-the-numbers formula melodrama, Escape benefited from its gritty looks, fantastic orchestral score, and the eerie atmosphere. The beauty of Escape from Los Angeles lies in the producer's refusal to stray from its formulaic origins. Moreover, the filmmakers have beefed up the budget, broadened the scope, and pumped up the story. Once again Snake battles the clock in his strenuous efforts to recover a device that can trigger world-wide destruction. There is a far greater sense of urgency in this Escape as we see Snake cutting corners and blowing away the opposition at every turn to save time. Director John Carpenter never lets the story slow down so we can catch our breath. Just when you think that you have it all figured out, he pulls a fast one with a clever surprise or two that enlivens this Escape. Escape from Los Angeles pushes the envelope further in all directions. Carpenter penned the script with producer Debra Hill and Kurt Russell. Snake's mission is no picnic. The filmmakers plunge Snake headlong into one rigorous, hair-raising adventure after another. Several familiar faces pad out the cast. Stacy Keach of Mike Hammer fame plays the same role Lee Van Cleef had in the original. Keach ranks as the top cop who coordinates between Snake and Cliff Robertson's scene-chewing president. Rain Man co-star Valerie Golino and Pulp Fiction's Steve Buscemi help Snake navigate through the rubble of Los Angeles. The only thing Escape from L. A. doesn't do better is repeat the same orchestral score. John Carpenter received credit for the music, but Shirley Walker of Batman) puts a spin on the theme that doesn't compare favorably to the original. If you thought the first Escape remotely entertaining, Escape from L.A. should blow your mind. Watch out for all that R-rated violence and profanity.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"8 August 2011","score":"","review":" If Snake Plissken had an attitude problem in Escape from New York, wait until you behold the havoc he wrecks in the long-awaited, slam-bang sequel Escape from Los Angeles, a memorable apocalyptic science fiction satire that more than compensates for many of the shortcomings in the original.In August 2000, an earthquake has separated Los Angeles from the California mainland. An ultra-conservative Jerry Falwell-type politician, who predicted the earthquake, has exploited his good fortune to win the presidency for a lifetime in the next election. He rewrites the laws so that he can hang on to the post for life then relocates the nation's capital to Lynchburg, Virginia. A new morally white-washed America has emerged by the year 2013. Cursing, smoking, pre-marital as well as extra-marital sex, and eating red meat now constitutes crimes. The government deports anybody who doesn't conform and sends them to the gang-infested cesspool of Los Angeles. The U.S. Police Force maintains a chain of forts along the coastline to repel the efforts of a South American revolutionary, Cuervo Jones (George Corraface of Christopher Columbus), who plans to spearhead a Third World invasion to reclaim America. Things take a turn for the worse when the President's naive daughter Utopia (A.J. Langer) steals the black box. The black box contains the remote control to activate a necklace of lethal satellites designated 'the Sword of Damocles.' These satellites encircle Earth, and they can fire a magnetic pulse beam with pinpoint accuracy that can disable any kind of electric engine. Utopia hijacks Air Force 3 and the jetliner crashes in L.A. She allies herself with Cuervo Jones who threatens to use the weapon against America. The U.S. Police Force dispatches a rescue team, but all die. Enter 'war hero' Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell of Tombstone), unshaven, sporting a black patch over his left eye and his typically surly attitude toward authority in general, in handcuffs with a police escort. The only thing Snake seems to be interested in is where he can get his next cigarette. The police infect Snake with a deadly virus that gives him less than ten hours to retrieve the black box. Reluctantly, Snake agrees to take the mission and rides a nuclear mini-sub into Los Angeles.Snake shares the sentiments of Marlon Brando's motorcycle maverick from The Wild One. When asked what he rebels against, Brando's black-leather clad biker replies What have you got? Whatever it is, Snake is against it. Snake thumbs his nose at the rules and the rule makers. He is the ultimate anti-hero, sent to save a civilization that he abhors. Former Disney star Kurt Russell reprises the tough guy tongue-in-cheek role he created in Escape from New York. No, you don't have to have seen the original to appreciate Escape from Los Angeles. His fastidious performance boasts equal amounts of put-on and posturing. Russell delivers his dialogue in a low, rasping monotone that parodies Clint Eastwood's 'Man with No Name bounty hunter character. Snake resembles a fashionably rode-hard but put-up-wet Marvel Comic super hero clad in skin-tight, black garb, with matching pistols. Nevertheless, Snake hardly qualifies as a super hero. The filmmakers have a great time poking fun at their one-eyed protagonist. Instead of calling him 'blue eyes,' they refer to him as 'blue eye.' Everybody who comes into contact with Snake for the first time expresses surprise that Snake isn't taller. Snake acts rather gullible on occasions when he has to depend on characters who double-cross him.While the first Escape represented a triumph of style over substance, the Escape sequel triumphs both in style and substance. Escape from New York attained classic cult status as a darkly comic, industrial-strength escapade where Snake rescued a U.S. President from a grim maximum security prison on Manhattan Island. The story generated at least a modicum of tension because Snake had to contend with the severe time restriction. He had been injected with a poison that would kill him if he failed to accomplish his mission by its deadline. Strictly a follow-the-numbers formula melodrama, Escape benefited from its gritty looks, fantastic orchestral score, and the eerie atmosphere. The beauty of Escape from Los Angeles lies in the producer's refusal to stray from its formulaic origins. Moreover, the filmmakers have beefed up the budget, broadened the scope, and pumped up the story. Once again Snake battles the clock in his strenuous efforts to recover a device that can trigger world-wide destruction. There is a far greater sense of urgency in this Escape as we see Snake cutting corners and blowing away the opposition at every turn to save time. Director John Carpenter never lets the story slow down so we can catch our breath. Just when you think that you have it all figured out, he pulls a fast one with a clever surprise or two that enlivens this Escape. Escape from Los Angeles pushes the envelope further in all directions. Carpenter penned the script with producer Debra Hill and Kurt Russell. Snake's mission is no picnic. The filmmakers plunge Snake headlong into one rigorous, hair-raising adventure after another. Several familiar faces pad out the cast. Stacy Keach of Mike Hammer fame plays the same role Lee Van Cleef had in the original. Keach ranks as the top cop who coordinates between Snake and Cliff Robertson's scene-chewing president. Rain Man co-star Valerie Golino and Pulp Fiction's Steve Buscemi help Snake navigate through the rubble of Los Angeles. The only thing Escape from L. A. doesn't do better is repeat the same orchestral score. John Carpenter received credit for the music, but Shirley Walker of Batman) puts a spin on the theme that doesn't compare favorably to the original. If you thought the first Escape remotely entertaining, Escape from L.A. should blow your mind. Watch out for all that R-rated violence and profanity.

This would seem to be Altman's tribute to his hometown and to the period when he was a kid-he would have been 9 in 1934.Altman's take on the outre political corruption in Kansas City at that time would seem to be of a sort with the corruption facilitated by the Pendergras machine of the time. His depiction of black characters as autonomous, strong characters is refreshing. Harry Belafonte's mob boss Seldom Seen has to be one of the most ruthless characters seen on celluloid in recent years. Belafonte is at the top of his game, his smoky baritone all the more ominous for his low-key manner. Belafonte really deserved an Oscar nomination for his performance in this movie. One of the many aspects to recommend this film is the music that lit up Kansas City at that time-jazz. The music, featuring Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins, and even a very young Charlie Parker before he was a musician, is electric. The musicians-played by world-class musicians like Joshua Redman, David 'Fathead' Newman, and Christian McBride, electrify the scenes they are in, particularly in one duel which continues until daybreak. The musical scenes are truly magical and electric. We get a sense of the energy and vibrance in the Kansas City music scene at that time.Altman also tweaks notions of race by having white Johnny Flynn (an almost silent Dermot Mulroney) attempting to knock off a mob underling while wearing blackface. Altman considers race and is not afraid to depict and play around with it. The very fact that he is willing to consider its existence and status in society is interesting in itself. There are many black characters, many given great depth and range. Altman adds depth to our understanding of race and fleshes out depiction of people of color in ways that the vast majority of directors do not even acknowledge or consider. This makes the film valuable in and of itself.The film's plot revolves around the kidnapping of the Missouri governor's wife Caroline Stilson (Miranda Richardson) who is kidnapped to pressure the Governor to release Blondie's husband (Dermot Mulroney's Jonny Flynn) who has been caught after trying to rip off one of Seldom Seen's mob lieutenants. Blondie thinks that taking the governor's wife hostage will cause the governor to take the release of her husband more seriously.Some people don't like Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance in this movie, suggesting that it is difficult to understand her. I think that was intentional on her part-an effort to pay tribute to the work of Jean Harlow who was from Kansas City and who we see in a movie that Caroline and Blondie are watching. It's clear that Jean Harlow was attempting to depict a tougher veneer than she really had, as we see as Blondie's tough outer shell collapses as the movie progresses. I found it a very original, Oscar-worthy, performance. Miranda Richardson's depiction of a depressed, drug-addled, lonely political wife who ultimately turns out to know more than she lets on is very compelling. The chemistry between her and Leigh is electric and Richardson's role is very interesting. She delivers an excellent performance in an unusual role.Altman interweaves story lines-those of Seldom Seen and Jonny Flynn on the one hand, and Caroline Stilson and Blondie on the other-expertly-linking them effortlessly. This is one of Altman's greatest strengths-tying in disparate story lines and making connections where they might be less obvious to most filmmakers. Altman makes connections among figures where most directors wouldn't see them.I don't think this film is on the level of his tours de force in Gosford Park, Short Cuts, The Player, MASH, and Nashville, but Altman was always more about depicting a milieu and setting a scene and if his story did not have the pyrotechnics of some of many films in theaters at the time, he didn't care. This film smolders quietly, suggesting a city rotting from the inside out as evidenced by the political and criminal malfeasance which are so brazen in the picture. Altman tells rich, colorful stories and this one is no exception.

Is the whole body just replicated, or does it get taken over mentally ? It's not clear from the movie.Dr Benett (Kevin McCrthy) is a small town doctor. One day when he goes out for a drive with his girlfriend Becky (Dana Wynter), a boy comes running out on the street almost getting runned over by his car. Later, the boy's grand mother brings the boy to his office claiming that the boy is upset over something. The boy is claiming that his mother is not his mother anymore. Thinking that the boy has over active imagination, Benett sends the boy to his grand mother's house for the night. Later that evening his friend finds a strange replica of a body and asks him to come and take a look. At inspection, the replica seems to be some sort of unfinished version of an actual person. Then they notice that more of them are growing in the greenhouse. Then it dawns on him that what the boy was saying was true, and the town is being taken over by the strange creatures that resembles a giant pea pod.This movie precedes the movie version of the Puppet Master by 20 years, and was better known for a long time. In terms of the production, this movie is superior to the Puppet Master or its own remake starring Donald Sutherland.The movie is in one hand a science fiction about an invasion from outer space, but on the other hand is a social drama depicting how vulnerable we are to covert take over of our society. It shows our mentality to believe everything is normal and prefer security over freedom. If the invasion took over the authority, infrastructure, and the government like it did in this movie, it would be relatively easy to take over the populace. We may be under such invasion right now, not by aliens but few people who controls the government, the media, and the financial system. The loss of freedom over security might be a very real scenario.Our society is turning into the caricature of this movie with people walking around with their iPODs. We're happy living this way as people in this movie were after they're taken over by the pod.Will we listen to Dr. Benett if he shows up in our society ? Will we give him the time of the day to see if what he's saying has any truth ? If not, we may be under attack, and never find out about it.

Is the whole body just replicated, or does it get taken over mentally ? It's not clear from the movie.Dr Benett (Kevin McCrthy) is a small town doctor. One day when he goes out for a drive with his girlfriend Becky (Dana Wynter), a boy comes running out on the street almost getting runned over by his car. Later, the boy's grand mother brings the boy to his office claiming that the boy is upset over something. The boy is claiming that his mother is not his mother anymore. Thinking that the boy has over active imagination, Benett sends the boy to his grand mother's house for the night. Later that evening his friend finds a strange replica of a body and asks him to come and take a look. At inspection, the replica seems to be some sort of unfinished version of an actual person. Then they notice that more of them are growing in the greenhouse.

This movie was not one of those movies, it had a creepy little ghost kid in it, but otherwise was just a straightforward good old fashioned ghost story without a lot of special effects.

In 1997, Andrew Niccol explored the future of our society where genetic perfection rules all. In Gattaca, Vincent Freeman, a genetic degenerate, assumes the identity of Jerome Eugene Morrow, the picture of genetic perfection, to gain access into the Gattaca space program. Vincent's dream was to travel to Jupiter before his heart was scheduled to stop; Jerome, who is paralyzed from the waist down, allows the use of his perfect identity to help Vincent achieve his dream. Acting\/Characters Ethan Hawke gives a brilliant performance as Vincent Freeman. Hawke shows the pain of a person cursed with the genetic defect of being what we consider a normal born child. His dedication to the role is seen through Vincent's dedication and drive at stopping at nothing to travel to Jupiter. Vincent is cunning in his disguise as Jerome Morrow making sure to clean and dispose of every hair and nail that may reveal his true identity thus derailing his lifelong dream. Jude Law as the real Jerome Morrow is an amusing character allowing Vincent to use his identity to pose as genetic perfect. Though he is often drunk and babbling about how much of an amazing person he use to be, deep inside Jude allows us to see Jerome's serious and vulnerable side. Irene Cassini is the lover of Vincent and is played by Ethan Hawke's past real life love Uma Thurman. Irene is sort of a cold character, but this is made so by her environment which disallows her (not as genetically perfect as she may seem) to be and love who she wants. She falls in love with Vincent posing as Jerome and is shocked yet memorized when she finds his true identity. Script Unlike most other first time screen writers, Andrew Niccol's Gattaca script was beyond brilliance. He takes us in deep at the very beginning of the film during Vincent's birth. Vincent's father refuses to name his first born son after himself as his name would be tainted by Vincent's genetic deformities. We are taken along with Vincent through his childhood where his is out-shined physically by his younger brother and shunned by his parents. The emotion digs even deeper as Vincent is denied job after job because of his poor genetics. He ends up as a janitor cleaning the ins and outs of the Gattaca building. It seems he will never travel into space even though the very building he cleans specializes in space travel.Niccol finally gives us hope as Vincent decides to take on Jerome Morrow's identity which is considered illegal in their society. Succeeding at literally becoming Jerome Morrow, Vincent is finally given the chance to travel through space as he is accepted into the Gattaca space program. But before he gets his chance, Niccol hits us again with a major stumbling block for Vincent &#x96; murder at Gattaca. Niccol continues to engage us as Vincent and Irene fall in love, and Vincent tries to conceal his true identity as detectives (including his own younger brother) rummage through Gattaca trying to find the murderer. Niccol gives us intense romance and thrill in this science fiction drama that once you've seen, it will never be forgotten.It's quite obvious I am in love with this film. It came out when I was only seven years old. I remember hearing Michael Nyman's brilliant score and remembering it up until I was about fifteen years old when I finally saw Gattaca in full.

There are lots of women in Iran without chador who use scarves to cover their hair and they don't even cover it completely as was shown in this movie. There are a few cases of asking women to cover their hair and it is never done as it is shown in this movie. They are often asked politely to cover their hair. The other point about chador is that it is not common for Iranian women to wear it at home and they definitely don't wear black chadors for praying at home. In this movie all women are wearing chador, even at home and even when they are praying. It was obviously tried to show everything about Iran dirty, ugly, primitive and savage. The houses and streets are dirty and destroyed, the women are ugly (which is actually the opposite!), men act like wild animals, etc. There are pictures of Khomeini and the logo of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards everywhere (even inside the house!). No woman wears make up. And I have no idea why there are soldiers and military cars in the streets! If you haven't been to Iran, please do not believe what you see in this movie. Although the Islamic regime is not what most of us want in Iran, it has never made our country as it is shown in this movie. ","genre":"Drama, Thriller"}]
