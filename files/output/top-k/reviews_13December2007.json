Or rather, I might have had more consistent laughter from the deliberate style of Spinal Tap, but with Phantom of Paradise the sudden bursts of manic behavior, of the spot-on satire of the period, it's hard to compare how big the laughs get. It might be just from seeing how original the material seems even as De Plama is borrowing so much (there's even a Psycho parody, only this time with Meat, a rock star with the voice of the guy from B52's, and the Phantom Winslow Leach), and how much De Palma reveals his love-hate bond with the music business. But beneath the surface there's also an interesting theme running through the power of creation and those who can just take it away and form it themselves. Who knows if, looking back at the director's history, De Palma was making a thinly guised jab at the producers behind Get to Know Your Rabbit? But it's more than that too The Phantom of Paradise is about selling your soul for artistic force, for vanity, for things that are unknown until the mask is pulled.In the 92 minute running time De Palma starts his film and ends it rocking along, thanks to Paul Williams's great songs and score (he also did the music five years later for the Muppet Movie), as the Juicy Fruits sing a number which Swan (Williams himself) is starting to not like much anymore. Enter in Winslow Leach, who plays piano and sings something fierce, and is approached by Swan's right-hand man to get into business. To be sure, if common sense were around, Winslow might try and get a copyright on his big opus on Faust. But Swan takes it away, forms and shapes it into his own thing, and Leach is set up and thrown in jail. Months pass, and he snaps and breaks out of jail (this, even if it was meant to be played seriously, which it might be, was the most hysterical part of the film), but gets injured and is presumed dead. And he arises- da-da-da!- to be a constant threat to the well-being of the Paradise theater, which is premiering his new musical without, as planned following a fake car bombing, the singer Phoenix (Harper).But there's more, much more, and it's insatiable entertainment, because De Palma understands how to skewer something as obvious to make fun of as the indulgent rock scene of the early 70s by having a product placement for a rock group name (including a singer who does Hispanic dialog mid-song!) and creates the backstage scene to look as vain and cruel as might be imaginable with just *this* much (holds fingers out) exaggerated. While Williams's songs are legitimately good, if not great, at being the kind of stand alone anthems that drag in a cult audience to sing along and jump and sing with it (albeit this is no Rocky Horror Show, this is poking fun at it more than reveling in it, which was the reverse for the big Midnight flick), it's the casting that clicks so well. It's amazing to see a scene like when Williams is looking at the mirror on the old film-reel, where comedy and creepiness merge together depending on when De Palma cuts. Or with the character of Meat, played by the actor so flamboyantly it's near classic. Or Harper, who is the gentle cliché of old who wants to be a rising star and gets it, at a Little Mermaid-type price.But the real star here, for my money, is Finley, who is one of the unsung great character actors of his time. From the rest of the work he did for other De Palma movies (be it an especially villainous role in Sisters, or the one uproarious scene in The Black Dahlia), one might think he was just this quirky, nerdy looking guy. Phantom of Paradise, however, allots him time to grimace and go bug-eyed and operatic to a beat that folds right in step with the typical (but brilliant in this case) style of the filmmaker.

It's too unpopular to do that. Mr Macy (the fictional owner of the Department store) is not going to denounce Santa, who helps bring holiday shoppers into his store at Christmas (neither - although he is not involved in the court case - would his fictional rival Mr. Gimbel). The wisdom of the entire matter is summed up in a great speech by Charlie Halloran (William Frawley), the political wizard behind Judge Harper (Gene Lockhard). If Harper decides to deny the existence of Santa he'll make enemies of merchants, toy manufacturers, kids and their parents, and others who get some satisfaction from the material side of the holiday season - Harper will ensure his total defeat at the polls! It is a lesson the astute Judge takes to heart.I suppose that the materialism of Christmas is to be denounced by purists, who think of the spiritual aspects frequently forgotten at Christmas. But the film reaffirms that the materialism of the holiday actually is an engine to the meaning of the holiday. In celebrating the birth and life of Jesus Christ, one is affirming a belief (ultimately) in the goodness of mankind and the truth of love. To show love frequently means sacrifice - here in expensive gifts to loved ones. If the pressures of modern advertising make this materialism too visible, the underlying purpose of gift buying is not to be materialistic but to show one cares for those one loves.Oddly enough Kris himself is willing to advertise the materialism to a point. At the Thanksgiving Day Parade he is last seen telling the children in the crowd that there are plenty of toys to be bought at Macy's (which, by the way, would be what he or the original Santa (Percy Helton) would have had to say in any case). Only later is Kris able to show more selective honesty here - he does tell one customer (Thelma Ritter) where she can get a toy at a cheaper cost than at Macy's. As a result the Department Store picks up on this and starts a policy of guiding people to other stores. In the real world I must admit it would not occur, but one likes the concept and wishes it would.The characters (for the most part) are likable, the one exception being Sawyer (Porter Hall) the obnoxious store psychologist. Sawyer misuses his so-called knowledge to make people feel mentally ill(telling one nice guy that his yearly stint at an orphanage as Santa is really from some bad act of his from many years past). Kris tells off Sawyer very easily, separating this vicious quack from genuine therapists who can help people.* (*Kris tells his friend Fred Gailey that he can easily control his visits with therapists, because he knows the answers to their questions which are usually the same ones. Actually this happens to be a common problem in therapy when dealing with criminals in prison who know what the therapists want to hear.

He says John Quincy Adams' Vice President was Daniel D. Tompkins. Tompkins (who was Governor of New York in the War of 1812) was James Monroe's Vice President - Adams' Veep was John C. Calhoun.) The real spiritual sense of the holiday is shown in the relationship of Kris and Fred with Doris and Susan Walker (Maureen O'Hara and Natalie Wood). Fred begins the process by softening the divorced Doris with his own version of kindness to her and Susan. But it is hard to reach Susan at first (though she likes Fred) because Doris is so determined to make her daughter a realist. It is only when Fred realizes that Doris does not like fancy or the outlandish because of her own hard fall into reality through her marriage that he shakes her up regarding what exactly makes life worthwhile (and it is not an adherence to reality all the time).As for Susan, her view is softened by Kris, who becomes a surrogate grandfather to her. The snagging point is that her world would be complete if she had a home, not a cramped apartment with her mother. Kris is concerned about the possibility of granting Susan that wish, but does not give up on it. And (as it turns out) it does complete the relationship between Doris and Fred - who will probably marry and move into such a house.

","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"13 December 2007","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" David Lean created a film that has already stood the so-called test of time &#150; in fact moreso, it has itself become the test and the measure against which all other war melodrama is compared. It has more to tell us about the struggle between the West and the Middle-East than any contemporary film I've seen. Here we have a strong contrast between the cynical career soldiers and diplomats (most memorably, Claude Rains in one of his last good roles) and an idealistic young man Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) who wants to help the Arab people establish their own state. But even with all his hope and his good intentions, Lawrence ends up destroying himself and perhaps leaving the Middle-East in a worse position than he found it. Lessons are to be learned from this film that still haven't been learned by all that many, despite its status as a revered classic. There's simply too many strong elements in this film to talk about within the space allowed here &#150; there are so many ideas floating around and so much beauty to behold on screen that every time I see it, it's like I'm seeing a slightly different movie that speaks to me about different things and inspires wonder in me that I've never felt before. With that in mind I advise anyone who hasn't seen it to stop reading, and also to try to see it in a theater if possible. Just to overview&#133;. Maurice Jarre's score is perfect; the instant you hear it you will always remember the images and characters of this movie. Freddie Young's photography has never been surpassed in terms of desert cinematography, and Lean manages not only to elicit deft performances from these actors but also to somehow keep the visual momentum flowing so that we're impressed with the monotonous nature and the isolation of the desert and yet never allowing the film's look to become totally static. For example when we see Lawrence sitting on the hill trying to decide if he should go South with Feisal (Alec Guinness) or lead some men West with Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif) we get a kind of night-time blueish color and a kind of slow breeze moving the sand in ripples that makes the scene totally unlike anything in the rest of the film. When Lawrence, Sheriff and Auda abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn) reach Acuba, there's a stunning shot that pans all the way from the desert through the city and to the ocean, at the same time breathtaking its scope and beauty and strangely depressing and isolating because it communicates the idea that the ocean is just a desert made of water, and we humans are the unfortunate ones who must make a living in the tiny spaces between.The performances are astounding, all around. Guinness is capable of doing more than he's required to here in this film, but he has the proper majesterial presence and his face is like a riddle. Quinn is all fire and passion, perhaps representing the most limited version of Arab identity in the film but doing so with so much force that his character is unforgettable. But the first time I saw this movie as an adult, I was most impressed with the performances of O'Toole and Sharif and the way those characters were developed in tandem &#150; Lawrence begins with noble intentions and ends up caught up in destructive and violent ego-fantasies, while Sharif begins as perhaps a petty and jealous man, shooting another Arab who dares to drink from his well, and becomes a politician with an appropriate amount of self-loathing and cynicism but who cares about the future of his people and believes in such a future more than Lawrence. The look on Sharif's face as O'Toole contemplates the fleeing Turkish army between his host and Damascus is one of the most haunting moments I've seen in any movie.I just can't say enough about how impressive this film is and how moved I am after watching it. It's really one of the most powerful films I've seen, worthy of comparison to other great epics like Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai and Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon.

It has more to tell us about the struggle between the West and the Middle-East than any contemporary film I've seen. Here we have a strong contrast between the cynical career soldiers and diplomats (most memorably, Claude Rains in one of his last good roles) and an idealistic young man Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) who wants to help the Arab people establish their own state. But even with all his hope and his good intentions, Lawrence ends up destroying himself and perhaps leaving the Middle-East in a worse position than he found it. Lessons are to be learned from this film that still haven't been learned by all that many, despite its status as a revered classic. There's simply too many strong elements in this film to talk about within the space allowed here &#150; there are so many ideas floating around and so much beauty to behold on screen that every time I see it, it's like I'm seeing a slightly different movie that speaks to me about different things and inspires wonder in me that I've never felt before.

Maurice Jarre's score is perfect; the instant you hear it you will always remember the images and characters of this movie. Freddie Young's photography has never been surpassed in terms of desert cinematography, and Lean manages not only to elicit deft performances from these actors but also to somehow keep the visual momentum flowing so that we're impressed with the monotonous nature and the isolation of the desert and yet never allowing the film's look to become totally static. For example when we see Lawrence sitting on the hill trying to decide if he should go South with Feisal (Alec Guinness) or lead some men West with Sheriff Ali (Omar Sharif) we get a kind of night-time blueish color and a kind of slow breeze moving the sand in ripples that makes the scene totally unlike anything in the rest of the film. When Lawrence, Sheriff and Auda abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn) reach Acuba, there's a stunning shot that pans all the way from the desert through the city and to the ocean, at the same time breathtaking its scope and beauty and strangely depressing and isolating because it communicates the idea that the ocean is just a desert made of water, and we humans are the unfortunate ones who must make a living in the tiny spaces between.The performances are astounding, all around. Guinness is capable of doing more than he's required to here in this film, but he has the proper majesterial presence and his face is like a riddle. Quinn is all fire and passion, perhaps representing the most limited version of Arab identity in the film but doing so with so much force that his character is unforgettable. But the first time I saw this movie as an adult, I was most impressed with the performances of O'Toole and Sharif and the way those characters were developed in tandem &#150; Lawrence begins with noble intentions and ends up caught up in destructive and violent ego-fantasies, while Sharif begins as perhaps a petty and jealous man, shooting another Arab who dares to drink from his well, and becomes a politician with an appropriate amount of self-loathing and cynicism but who cares about the future of his people and believes in such a future more than Lawrence. The look on Sharif's face as O'Toole contemplates the fleeing Turkish army between his host and Damascus is one of the most haunting moments I've seen in any movie.I just can't say enough about how impressive this film is and how moved I am after watching it.

My own recollection for Roberts was some unfair carping about her nice follow-up (with Richard Gere) to PRETTY WOMEN, RUNAWAY BRIDE. Basically a different storyline, the fans of the former film were confused by the nuttiness of the latter one. For Grant there has never been a negative comment about his films that I recall, but rather that embarrassing prostitute incident a few years back that really just showed that the actor was human. Both have a nice film charisma that makes their myriads of fans very happy. In NOTTING HILL the charisma of both mixed well on screen. It is a very sweet comedy.Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) is basically a clone of Roberts - she is a multi-talented and beautiful film star who is known around the globe. One day she is doing a Haroun - Al - Raschid act (like the Caliph in the stories of THE ARABIAN NIGHTS who goes in disguise among his subjects). She is doing some simple sightseeing and shopping in London's Notting Hill Section. She enters a bookstore specializing in travel books. It is owned by William Thacker (Hugh Grant), who lives in the neighborhood. Thacker's business is struggling along, with too many people coming in expecting it sells best-sellers (John Grisham) or classics (Dickens). He keeps correcting them about this.*(And the script writer makes a mistake - a minor one. Dickens, unlike what Thacker tells a stupid customer, did write several travel books THE UNCOMMERCIAL TRAVELLER and PICTURES FROM ITALY are two of them.)Due to an accidental collision between the two in the street, Thacker invites Scott into his home to clean herself. He behaves with typical charm and care not to offend her. She leaves, but a moment later rings the bell again, and when inside kisses him. Later she leaves a message (that is nearly lost due to Thacker's idiot roommate (Spike - Rhys Infans)) to visit her at the Ritz Hotel in London. Thacker does see Scott, but has to pretend he is a movie reviewer for the magazine HORSE AND HOUND. He ends up asking questions to her and her co-stars about their latest film (which he knows nothing about), and how it relates to horses and hounds (it is a space epic, so it doesn't). But Scott and he go out together that night to a dinner party at Thacker's family's home.The film progresses like this, as we see the attraction between the two develop. Both are basically simple types, and the glitz of Scott's film reputation belies her feet on the ground approach to life - except for her fear about scandal. Like all celebrities she tries to avoid that shade of limelight that Holly Golightly says really ruins many girls complexions. This makes things difficult for Thacker's dating of Scott, as she frequently is aware of cynical comments made about her (watch the scene in the restaurant for this), and she has to also put up with hyped publicity stories such as her long standing relationship with a prominent film actor (Alec Baldwin in a nice single scene). Finally, she flees to Thacker after a couple of months, when she is facing an embarrassment over some nude photos and an old (secret) nude film that was shot of her. Thacker gives her what seems to be quiet and protection in his home, only to find that the press is tipped off. Scott is aware that while Thacker will be able to shrug this off in a short time, she will have the scandal of their relationship follow her for her life. She leaves him in anger.Will that be the end of the line for the lovers? I'll let the viewer see the film. Savor the performances of the leads who do fit well together, but also of Infans, who is the guileless dimwit who never realizes the long range results of his blunders.

Later she leaves a message (that is nearly lost due to Thacker's idiot roommate (Spike - Rhys Infans)) to visit her at the Ritz Hotel in London. Thacker does see Scott, but has to pretend he is a movie reviewer for the magazine HORSE AND HOUND. He ends up asking questions to her and her co-stars about their latest film (which he knows nothing about), and how it relates to horses and hounds (it is a space epic, so it doesn't). But Scott and he go out together that night to a dinner party at Thacker's family's home.The film progresses like this, as we see the attraction between the two develop. Both are basically simple types, and the glitz of Scott's film reputation belies her feet on the ground approach to life - except for her fear about scandal. Like all celebrities she tries to avoid that shade of limelight that Holly Golightly says really ruins many girls complexions. This makes things difficult for Thacker's dating of Scott, as she frequently is aware of cynical comments made about her (watch the scene in the restaurant for this), and she has to also put up with hyped publicity stories such as her long standing relationship with a prominent film actor (Alec Baldwin in a nice single scene). Finally, she flees to Thacker after a couple of months, when she is facing an embarrassment over some nude photos and an old (secret) nude film that was shot of her. Thacker gives her what seems to be quiet and protection in his home, only to find that the press is tipped off. Scott is aware that while Thacker will be able to shrug this off in a short time, she will have the scandal of their relationship follow her for her life. She leaves him in anger.Will that be the end of the line for the lovers? I'll let the viewer see the film. Savor the performances of the leads who do fit well together, but also of Infans, who is the guileless dimwit who never realizes the long range results of his blunders. Yet in the end he proves to have more sense than Grant does in what to do about the relationship with Roberts.NOTTING HILL is a real charmer for the movie fan, and a rarity in the present age of angst and bloodshed in our films. I recommend it heartily.

First of all I personally see the movie as not a biopic of Jim Morrisons life but a biopic of Jim Morrisons myth and legend. We've all heard the stories of the excess of drugs and alcohol he had done, all of the insane antics he had pulled (hanging off from hotel balcony's and setting rooms ablaze), his strange and random sexual promiscuity's, and of course the infamous Miami concert. All of these incidents and more are put into the film as we would have remembered them from our outsiders perspective. Nothing solved and no insight gained, just a straight view of how we've been groomed to remember him. An easier way of putting it is that the film is a collage of memories we, as fans, would have when thinking back on The Doors legend. The ultimate sex, drugs, and rock&roll story. So if you're looking for a Coal Miners Daughter kind of insight into Morrisons true life, I recommend that you steer clear from this movie and go pick up one of the many Morrison bio's from the Library (No One Here Get's Out Alive would be my personal choice).The film begins where, as far as Jim would let us know, his life began. On a desert highway where he and his family passed by the sight of a wreck that killed some Pueblo Indians. Jim would later say that this was the most important moment of his life and believed that the soul of one of the dying Indians jumped into his body. We actually see this Indian soul in the film and get to observe as it follows Jim all the way up till the end. We see nothing else from Jims childhood and are brought directly to the next checkpoint in Morrisons legend, his quiting of UCLA Film School. This trend of going from checkpoint to checkpoint continues all the way up to the last point we know of in Paris.Val Kilmer, who is always fantastic, once again steals the screen with his performance of the late artist. Not only is he visually astounding in his replication of Jim but he also does some of his own vocals, nearly identical to that of Morrison. Another performance worth mentioning is Crispin Glover as Andy Warhol, he is only on screen for a very short amount of time but what a time it was.

The majority of the soundtrack is the Doors own music, in fact it's almost played out like a music video for the band half the time and a lot of the dialog spoken is even Jims own lyrics and poetry. All in all Stone did an excellent job in bringing to screen the ultimate rock lifestyle.To sum it up, see this film if you are into The Doors music, great performances, and an interesting look into the life of a stereotypical rock star legend... just try to understand it's a movie of a myth not a man.S.C.W.

But the first thing that stops me from doing so is the fact that I saw this as a child of perhaps 11 or 12, when the film should have been very effective, and I detested it at that time. I still remember that night because my folks didn't go out all that often, but they got this movie for us and hired a babysitter who happened to be a brunette! Anyway, seeing it now I realize there's a lot of good reasons why so many people love this movie. However, there are still enough problems with the movie from my own personal perspective that I think I can understand why this is more of a cult film than a hit film.First of all, it's far too much of a chick flick. The style in general is very gentle, even in the scary and violent parts. Compare the goblins to the villains in Henson's Dark Crystal or the stormtroopers in Star Wars. These goblins are too cute and goofy to present even the semblance of danger that the film needs them to. Then you have the whole faux romance between Jennifer Connelly's character and the Goblin King (David Bowie). The masquerade scene is pretty good cinema, but any boy from the age of 5 to 105 is going to want to tear his hair out.Speaking of Bowie, I still remember when I first saw the movie how much I hated his music and how badly it damaged the film for me as fantasy. I know they were probably going for something like The Wizard of Oz, but David Bowie is no Harold Arlen, and the overproduced technology of the song instantly dates it and removes the essential timeless element of the fantasy. If you think I'm simply engaging in wishful nostalgic sophistry, consider the fact that the producers of Wizard were wise enough to remove a silly song called The Jitterbug from the film despite having spent over $100,000 filming the scene for 3 weeks because they felt it was a bad idea to associate their fantasy movie with a 1940s dance fad that would damage its staying power. Their wisdom ensured that the film would continue to enchant audiences forever, while the short-sighted decisions of Lucas and Henson created a film that seemed dated the instant it was released, irreparably tainted by second-rate 1980s club music.Aside from the musical aspects Bowie is OK, though I never feel that he's either sexy or scary. But my girlfriend thinks he's sexy, so what do I know? Jennifer Connelly on the other hand saves the film in my opinion. It's an amazing performance given her age and the fact that she's playing opposite puppets. It's great how in the early scenes she seems uncomfortable and out of her element but seems to come into her own while in the fantasy world. She did it so flawlessly that I think some viewers (judging from the comments here) mistook it for tentative acting. I thought she really knew already how to use her eyes, always maintaining asymmetry for the sake of dynamics. Hiring Connelly was the smartest thing the producers did, and of course now that she's very well-respected it looks even smarter. She was very good a few years later in a film that Dario Argento did, but I didn't realize just how young she was when she was showing so much skill.The puppets &#150; the big huge one was fantastic, love him &#150; a cross between the Cowardly Lion and Snuffaluffagus. The little dog was also marvelous. Along with the talking doorknobs he reminds me the most of characters in other Terry Jones movies and sketches. The fiery dudes who take their heads off were fun too. But the main puppet was a disaster &#150; the face was far too humanoid and I didn't care for his voice either. Honestly I know this sounds harsh but it would have been a better film if they had just hired Billy Barty. The film relies on this character very heavily and the animatronic head on a little person just didn't work for me although the effort itself and the ambition is admirable. I noticed that Henson family members worked on this puppet and I think more scrutiny should have been applied in the concept phase.Sadly, the failure of this film along with Dark Crystal and Fraggle Rock permanently scarred Jim Henson's mystique and hastened the end of the golden age of muppets. Henson himself even more sadly never go the chance to redeem his reputation as he probably could have done. I always loved the muppets and I really wanted to love this movie too &#150; both when it came out and now &#150; but the awful 80s Bowie music and various other elements just don't mesh together for me. This movie is interesting to watch because of Jones' writing and Connelly's acting, but the execution is off. You get the feeling that some really good concepts are just not being done in the way that would make them work, there's a disconnect between the script and the direction and I suspect that Jones' script might have been too raunchy and earthy for Henson's tastes. I kept wishing that the film had turned out better.

The style in general is very gentle, even in the scary and violent parts. Compare the goblins to the villains in Henson's Dark Crystal or the stormtroopers in Star Wars. These goblins are too cute and goofy to present even the semblance of danger that the film needs them to. Then you have the whole faux romance between Jennifer Connelly's character and the Goblin King (David Bowie). The masquerade scene is pretty good cinema, but any boy from the age of 5 to 105 is going to want to tear his hair out.Speaking of Bowie, I still remember when I first saw the movie how much I hated his music and how badly it damaged the film for me as fantasy. I know they were probably going for something like The Wizard of Oz, but David Bowie is no Harold Arlen, and the overproduced technology of the song instantly dates it and removes the essential timeless element of the fantasy. If you think I'm simply engaging in wishful nostalgic sophistry, consider the fact that the producers of Wizard were wise enough to remove a silly song called The Jitterbug from the film despite having spent over $100,000 filming the scene for 3 weeks because they felt it was a bad idea to associate their fantasy movie with a 1940s dance fad that would damage its staying power. Their wisdom ensured that the film would continue to enchant audiences forever, while the short-sighted decisions of Lucas and Henson created a film that seemed dated the instant it was released, irreparably tainted by second-rate 1980s club music.Aside from the musical aspects Bowie is OK, though I never feel that he's either sexy or scary. But my girlfriend thinks he's sexy, so what do I know? Jennifer Connelly on the other hand saves the film in my opinion. It's an amazing performance given her age and the fact that she's playing opposite puppets. It's great how in the early scenes she seems uncomfortable and out of her element but seems to come into her own while in the fantasy world. She did it so flawlessly that I think some viewers (judging from the comments here) mistook it for tentative acting. I thought she really knew already how to use her eyes, always maintaining asymmetry for the sake of dynamics. Hiring Connelly was the smartest thing the producers did, and of course now that she's very well-respected it looks even smarter. She was very good a few years later in a film that Dario Argento did, but I didn't realize just how young she was when she was showing so much skill.The puppets &#150; the big huge one was fantastic, love him &#150; a cross between the Cowardly Lion and Snuffaluffagus. The little dog was also marvelous. Along with the talking doorknobs he reminds me the most of characters in other Terry Jones movies and sketches. The fiery dudes who take their heads off were fun too. But the main puppet was a disaster &#150; the face was far too humanoid and I didn't care for his voice either. Honestly I know this sounds harsh but it would have been a better film if they had just hired Billy Barty. The film relies on this character very heavily and the animatronic head on a little person just didn't work for me although the effort itself and the ambition is admirable. I noticed that Henson family members worked on this puppet and I think more scrutiny should have been applied in the concept phase.Sadly, the failure of this film along with Dark Crystal and Fraggle Rock permanently scarred Jim Henson's mystique and hastened the end of the golden age of muppets. Henson himself even more sadly never go the chance to redeem his reputation as he probably could have done. I always loved the muppets and I really wanted to love this movie too &#150; both when it came out and now &#150; but the awful 80s Bowie music and various other elements just don't mesh together for me. This movie is interesting to watch because of Jones' writing and Connelly's acting, but the execution is off. You get the feeling that some really good concepts are just not being done in the way that would make them work, there's a disconnect between the script and the direction and I suspect that Jones' script might have been too raunchy and earthy for Henson's tastes. I kept wishing that the film had turned out better.

But the first thing that stops me from doing so is the fact that I saw this as a child of perhaps 11 or 12, when the film should have been very effective, and I detested it at that time.

This is not because of its plot, which is fairly simplistic, or the characters, which play like the comic strip characters that inspired them. Rather its the pure ambition of the film that is puzzling.Dick Tracy was made after Batman, which was nothing short of a re-imagining of a comic book hero, removed from the confines of the colorful world of comic books. If Batman was an intent remove its hero from the comic book world, Dick Tracy sets out to celebrate it.The artistry of this film is original. It is not just merely an attempt to recreate a comic book world - it is one. The heroes' outfits are mixtures of all sorts of solid colors that look like their lifted straight from a painter's palette - Yellows, Greens, Oranges abound. There is no attempt to make the villains more realistic. They're here in classic form Prune Face, Flat Top, Big Boy, Lips Manless. The comic feel is even captured in the films scenes, which each play like a 3-4 panel comic strip.This is where ambition becomes a bit much for a film to handle. While the attempt to capture the spirit of the comic is to be admired, the result is a rather awkwardly paced film. While there's never a dull moment, the action and resolution seem rather trivialized. The barrage of characters is overwhelming. Furthermore, the cardboard characterizations keep us from really caring about anyone. It becomes a rich looking spectacle, and nothing more.Complaints aside, it is well acted. Besides Al Pacino's pastiche of noir gangster types everywhere, there are a couple of supporting and one could even say cameo performances that are memorable. Notably, Dustin Hoffman as Mumbles.

(Well, OK, maybe my Aunt Frici in the nursing home hasn't seen it yet either.) So permit me a moment or two while I preach to the choir. Far from being just another Exorcist rip-off, The Omen is a literate, handsomely mounted horror picture that shows us what happens when American ambassador Gregory Peck discovers that his cute little boy is no less a personage than the Antichrist. (And you thought you had problems with YOUR 5-year-old!) Peck's presence, as well as Lee Remick's, add immeasurable class and dignity to the proceedings. The picture would have been far less an achievement without their presences, but Richard Donner's imaginative direction and Jerry Goldsmith's creepy score (incorporating what sounds like Gregorian chants) help put it over the top. Billie Whitelaw should be singled out as well, for her turn as the (literal) nanny from hell. Leo McKern, strangely uncredited, is also fine in his small but crucial role. The film contains at least half a dozen classic and violent set pieces, culminating with what might be the most suspenseful haircut in film history. But then again, the entire film is extremely suspenseful and believable, and not a little scary. My stomach was in knots by the final credits, but I'm so glad that I FINALLY got to see this modern-era horror classic.

The director, Paul Verhoeven (who later became an even bigger player with films like Total Recall and Basic Instinct) has definitely indulged in extreme violence and has no qualms about presenting violence as an object of fun. But I would defend it even if its only virtue was its action sequences because those elements are handled so well. There's a number of imaginatively staged action scenes, and it never devolves into an arcade-style shooting gallery like so many 80s actions films do. The action is compelling because of Verhoeven's style and because he's given the characters enough substance that we care about what happens to them, including at least a half dozen interesting villains.A lot of discussion has revolved around whether or not this film deserves to be called satire. Those looking for Moliere-like pearls in Verhoeven's modestly amusing commercial interruptions are understandably disappointed. This isn't the kind of movie that you can look at or objectify in order to access its ideas on an intellectual level. It's a different kind of beast it must be entered into, it must fulfill its function as an action narrative first and foremost and it carries its ideas like a wedding train dragged by a semi-truck&#133; a prominent after-thought. At any rate I feel it's closer to camp than satire, one of the first camp action films of the 80s style I would argue (Remo Williams being another, now largely forgotten). It's a good drinking movie, and this most recent time when I watched it my friend and I were laughing and yelling so much that we probably missed half the dialog. But I don't think we missed much of the point. If it was a satire, Robocop wouldn't emerge as such a serious figure invested with pathos and personality. The movie itself is best enjoyed in my opinion as a joyride with some interesting commentary about America's relationship to violence thrown in by way of farce; you wait for each villain to meet his fitting end and watch the carnage pile up. The villains are all so easy to hate, and all the actors playing them are having a lot of fun. Ronny Cox is fantastic as the corporate heel, but I've always enjoyed Kurtwood Smith the most. Really this is a very well-cast movie all around. I love the scene where Miguel Ferrer has his coke party interrupted by Smith with his bomb and his video. It's easy to underestimate the kind of skill Smith shows when he's so funny and obviously has his tongue in cheek but still manages to be convincingly sadistic and evil. Honestly, a comparison to Vincent Price in his heyday is not unwarranted.Weller for his part is adequate and it's a difficult role so that's no insult. I didn't care for Nancy Allen in the movie but I can't really put my finger on the reasons. I guess she just came across as very tentative. I think it was a small mistake for Verhoeven to have her play it in a more grounded mode; his butt-kicking females are more fascinating but he does always have problems directing female heroes (see Showgirls and Total Recall for example).I think this is a pretty intelligent movie with some layers to it. It's better as science fiction than you would at first suspect, mining Frankenstein territory in a number of scenes &#150; particularly where the callous nature of the creator is shown (lose the arm) and when the police force turns on Robocop like the mob of angry villagers in Whale's film version. In Shelley's time perhaps a single scientist was a suitable object of terror, but by choosing corporate monster-makers the writers of this film gave the story a far more prescient object for paranoia. Indeed, even since I last saw the film in the late 90s, the film's central premise has become even more relevant due to America's misadventures with corporate security forces in Iraq. This time around I noticed all the elements of Western parody in the film. Not just the twirling pistol (which also, interestingly, performs a plot function by identifying Robocop as Murphy) but also in various other scenes. For example one poster here complained about the generic or obligatory nature of the convenience store scene and the rape scene where Robocop is introduced as a hero. I couldn't disagree more. They parallel the arrival of the hero in a traditional Western; the convenience store works for the trading post in Shane, the nightclub scene doubles for a tavern brawl (i.e. the beginning of Rio Bravo) and the attempted rape parallels any number of damsel in distress scenarios. That's a very funny scene for me because of the way the girl goes up to Robocop after he rescues her and kind of drapes herself over him (My hero!), a very prototypical American bit that you'd see in a Randolph Scott Western from the 40s. Robocop's sterile reaction is perfect, again a parody of the emotionless law enforcing gunfighter of the Old West of American mythology.I expect to find more and more interesting elements the more I watch the film over the years. I think recently its reputation has taken a slight hit &#150; look at the interesting life this film has had. Originally it was a big hit both in theaters and on video. Over the years it was not forgotten because action movie fans would return to it and be surprised at how well it holds up and how many ideas are floating about beneath the surface. Then based on their recommendations movie-goers of a more intellectual bent gave the movie a chance and were disappointed. It's time for the pendulum to swing back and for the movie to be reclaimed as what it is &#150; an intelligent violent film.

It brought to attention the previously unknown Tim Burton, who provided the perfect starring vehicle for oddball comedian Pee-wee Herman (in real life Paul Reubens).The mingling of Burton's kitsch aesthetic with Reuben's bizarre persona turned out to be a perfect match. Big Adventure had a very simple story to go from. Pee-wee wanted to be reunited with his beloved bike. And that basic premise was all it needed. Burton infused the film with a beautiful colour scheme, oddball delights and kooky curiosities, all played to the hilt by the irrepressible Pee-wee.Pee-wee's Big Adventure turned out to be a surprise box-office smash hit, cementing Burton's place among Hollywood's brightest and eccentric filmmakers.It took three years for a further instalment to arrive on the big screen. In the interim, Pee-wee got his own TV show, Pee-wee's Playhouse, and dominated the ratings as the host of one of America's most popular children's shows. Reubens took time out from the show in 1988 to make one more film, Big Top Pee-wee.Big Top came about a year before Reuben's career was damaged after he was caught masturbating in an X-rated movie theatre. The character was effectively retired after that, and although there is talk of a new Pee-wee Herman movie in the making, I'm still not entirely sure it will ever happen.In the meantime, we do have two of his adventures to fall back on. But after seeing Big Top, you wonder if you really want to see another one. Because the Pee-wee Herman you see here is not quite the one you remember.It seems that Pee-wee has done a bit of growing up. Where in the first he was content to potter about his pastel coloured mansion playing with Rube Goldberg breakfast making contraptions and copiously caring for his customized bike, here Pee-wee has settled into an almost normal life.Don't forget...I said almost! Pee-wee's now a farmer. He cultivates hot dog trees, tends to cows that produce chocolate milk, and he even has a talking pig, Vance as a business partner!He even has a personal life now. He's engaged to prim schoolmistress Winnie (Penelope Ann Miller), and lives in a normal town. Unfortunately, he's forced to share it with some not very nice townsfolk.But one windy day, fate blows a circus right into Pee-wee's backyard, all filled with curious kooks. First there's ringmaster Mace Montana (Kris Kristofferson, excellent). His wife, Midge, 2 inches tall, with a voice much bigger than she is. And best of all, Gina (Valeria Golino), the beautiful acrobat and star attraction, the woman Pee-wee falls for.I think the reason Big Top Pee-wee isn't as successful is because it doesn't have a director who's perfectly attuned to the material. The joy of the first film was Tim Burton provided an eccentric outsider's take on life. But this film's director, Randal Kleiser doesn't have that quality. He doesn't occupy Pee-wee's headspace the way Burton was able to.And the more Pee-wee tries to fit in to our world, the more apart from it he seems. He has no place in our world. He lives in one of his own rules and devisings.Also with foreknowledge of what was to come for Reubens, you do get a bit uncomfortable watching him 'nail' Winnie, engage in a bit of two-timing, and the film even implies that he loses his virginity to Gina. With him still hosting a children's show at the time of the film's release, that makes it seem all the more unpalatable.There are occasions where Big Top shows some of the similar quirks that made the first film so endearing. Like Pee-wee's farm animals sleeping in beds. Pee-wee plucking a worm from an apple to feed birds. And all the animals gathered around a table for breakfast. Danny Elfman also provides another whimsical film score to enjoy.But Big Top never really ignites. It never bursts out with the joy and exuberance that Burton brought to the first one. There is a good cast, but they somehow look a little awkward trying their best to connect with someone as alien as Pee-wee.Kris Kristofferson probably comes off best by playing the sincerity perfectly straight. But the one real shining light is the underrated Valeria Golino. She brings a passionate charge to the role of Gina. She brings Pee-wee down to earth, but is wise enough not to leave him there for too long. Because she knows he's always at his best when filled with childlike whimsy. She reminds us of the Pee-wee we once knew.Big Top Pee-wee never inhabits the bizarre, unreal world that made the first film such a treat. I think Pee-wee has become too domesticated. If there is to be another Pee-wee adventure, he can't be kept on a leash. He must be allowed to flourish. That way we can enjoy the company of the Pee-wee we remember so well.

It brought to attention the previously unknown Tim Burton, who provided the perfect starring vehicle for oddball comedian Pee-wee Herman (in real life Paul Reubens).The mingling of Burton's kitsch aesthetic with Reuben's bizarre persona turned out to be a perfect match. Big Adventure had a very simple story to go from. Pee-wee wanted to be reunited with his beloved bike. And that basic premise was all it needed. Burton infused the film with a beautiful colour scheme, oddball delights and kooky curiosities, all played to the hilt by the irrepressible Pee-wee.Pee-wee's Big Adventure turned out to be a surprise box-office smash hit, cementing Burton's place among Hollywood's brightest and eccentric filmmakers.It took three years for a further instalment to arrive on the big screen. In the interim, Pee-wee got his own TV show, Pee-wee's Playhouse, and dominated the ratings as the host of one of America's most popular children's shows. Reubens took time out from the show in 1988 to make one more film, Big Top Pee-wee.Big Top came about a year before Reuben's career was damaged after he was caught masturbating in an X-rated movie theatre. The character was effectively retired after that, and although there is talk of a new Pee-wee Herman movie in the making, I'm still not entirely sure it will ever happen.In the meantime, we do have two of his adventures to fall back on. But after seeing Big Top, you wonder if you really want to see another one. Because the Pee-wee Herman you see here is not quite the one you remember.It seems that Pee-wee has done a bit of growing up. Where in the first he was content to potter about his pastel coloured mansion playing with Rube Goldberg breakfast making contraptions and copiously caring for his customized bike, here Pee-wee has settled into an almost normal life.Don't forget...I said almost! Pee-wee's now a farmer. He cultivates hot dog trees, tends to cows that produce chocolate milk, and he even has a talking pig, Vance as a business partner!He even has a personal life now. He's engaged to prim schoolmistress Winnie (Penelope Ann Miller), and lives in a normal town. Unfortunately, he's forced to share it with some not very nice townsfolk.But one windy day, fate blows a circus right into Pee-wee's backyard, all filled with curious kooks. First there's ringmaster Mace Montana (Kris Kristofferson, excellent). His wife, Midge, 2 inches tall, with a voice much bigger than she is. And best of all, Gina (Valeria Golino), the beautiful acrobat and star attraction, the woman Pee-wee falls for.I think the reason Big Top Pee-wee isn't as successful is because it doesn't have a director who's perfectly attuned to the material. The joy of the first film was Tim Burton provided an eccentric outsider's take on life. But this film's director, Randal Kleiser doesn't have that quality. He doesn't occupy Pee-wee's headspace the way Burton was able to.And the more Pee-wee tries to fit in to our world, the more apart from it he seems. He has no place in our world. He lives in one of his own rules and devisings.Also with foreknowledge of what was to come for Reubens, you do get a bit uncomfortable watching him 'nail' Winnie, engage in a bit of two-timing, and the film even implies that he loses his virginity to Gina. With him still hosting a children's show at the time of the film's release, that makes it seem all the more unpalatable.There are occasions where Big Top shows some of the similar quirks that made the first film so endearing. Like Pee-wee's farm animals sleeping in beds. Pee-wee plucking a worm from an apple to feed birds. And all the animals gathered around a table for breakfast.

It is nauseatingly violent, but then so are the kind of people it is based upon. No sensitive person should try to see this, as it is far, far too horrible. The violence is so sickening that it is intolerable. The entire project is of questionable integrity, even though in the latter half, some justification is offered when there is a major change of heart and mind by the lead character. Edward Norton, one of the world's most versatile film actors, gives another staggering performance, as does Edward Furlong as his younger brother. It is all very well done, but should it have been done, that is the question. This film portrays in a way no mainstream film has ever done the extremes and depths of racist hate cults, and we are left with nothing to speculate about as far as American Neo-Nazis are concerned. By the time you have sat through this, you have seen more swastikas than you could find in 'Triumph of the Will', but these are up close and personal, like Norton's tattooed on his chest. The scenes in prison are so far beyond appalling that we run out of shocked adjectives. If you ever wanted to know how Neo-Nazis think, because you just couldn't wait, here it all is. But have plenty of vomit bags handy. I am inclined to think that this is a piece of exploitation masquerading as a serious social and psychological study. Why not make a film about suicide bombers and decapitating people next? But why stop there? There is always bayoneting babies to move onto after that. Can this sort of thing be justified? The fact that it is a well-made film makes it worse. I think our 'need to know' is spurious, and that the people who made this film are all deeply, deeply sick, and should be ashamed of themselves. This film will only stimulate crazies to emulate the insane racists, and I bet tattoo artists get a lot more business after this. Also, the racist attitudes portrayed and statements made in the film are so disgustingly offensive that no one has ever plumbed such depths in a film, and I believe that such unspeakable evil should not be given publicity, and that such maggot-ridden and rotten things should not be brought out into the light. It is a fallacy to think that by showing them anything constructive can be achieved. Elliott Gould in the film looked shell-shocked at the horror of it all. I know how he feels. He should have walked out of the film, not just out of the house. What was he doing, lending his name to this?
