To the outside world, the Burnham family is happy everyday American family living the American dream. As we learn through the very detailed movie is that is not quite the truth. The truth is that the Burnham family is fake and that that Lester, Carolyn's husband, is just for show, and that Carolyn isn't faithful to her husband. We learn that Jane hates her parents, and that they she is like every other teenager, Janie's a pretty typical teenager. Angry, insecure, confused. I wish I could tell her that's all going to pass, but I don't want to lie to her. (Lester Burnham narrating) Compared this to the Fits's family were the father is a marine colonel and is an angry man. His son Ricky is a distributed person who might me the most liberated person through out the whole movie or at least till the end. Barbra Fits the wife to Col.

Things we've seen before, countless times in other films, are simply shuffled around.

It is a wonderful psychological drama, a satire about the American community and about the American life; dark, painful irony and cynicism in the descriptions of life and characters; deep sarcasm on types of people in the community, habits of behavior such as ...if you want to succeed, you always have to seem successful... or never stop smiling, parasites of the community, and, most importantly, the treatment of people who are different, who are freaky to some extent; and eventually, there is no character in the film that is not odd in its way, although we have to wait for the very ending of the film, to discover this. In order to start looking at this in-depth film we must start at the begging, with one of the best opening lines in film of all time. My name is Lester Burnham. This is my neighborhood; this is my street; this is my life. I am 42 years old; in less than a year I will be dead. Of course I don't know that yet, and in a way, I am dead already. With this line we learn that the downfall of Lester has already begun, and this downfall will subsequently lead to his untimely death. At the start of the movie we learn that Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a 42 year old man living what seems like an ordinary life, but is from an ordinary life. We learn that Lester's home life is what people would consider normal, we learned that his wife (Carolyn) and him have not been happy in years and that his daughter (Jane). Throughout the movie, Lester is trying to get with Jane's bff (best friend) Angela Hayes, Angela a 16 year old cheerleader. By the end he does, and that's when the role of not judging a book by its cover comes in as he learns out that Angela is not a promiscuous person, and that she is anything but that, for she is a virgin. This concedes with another important part of the tale with Jane, meeting Ricky Fits, Ricky who is anything but normal, and people find him a outcast, finds true love with Jane. We also realize that Ricky was most likely the most liberated person in the begging of the film but by the end him and Jane would both be UN-liberated. Then we get to Carolyn story, of having a unfair life, and has more interest in material things, then actual family. With this in mind she ends of cheating on Lester, with THE REALSTATE KING (Buddy Kane) Finally we get to the person who kills Lester with a single gun shot to the back of the head. Col. Frank Fits USMC, from the begging of the film we are to believe that Col. Fits beats his son, and is a tough man, and is anti gay! But this is not true, in actuality Col. Fits is a closeted gay, and when he kisses Lester, (he saw Ricky and Lester doing things that looked like Ricky was giving Lester a blow-job) and his secret is revealed and not only is it revealed but that, Lester rejected him, Col.

For some reason, David (Christopher Eccleston), Juliet (Kerry Fox) and Alex (McGregor) suddenly decide to find a fourth flatmate and after discarding several candidates they finally agree on giving novelist Hugo a chance, on the grounds that he is interesting. Shame this guy dies mysteriously overnight, leaving a suitcase full of money behind. This triggers a conflict between the protagonists, as Alex and Juliet want to keep the money, while David doesn't think it's a good idea. It takes quite some arguing to convince him to hide the cash somewhere in the flat and get rid of the corpse as fast as possible (hence the title). Having done this, David starts to develop a dangerous paranoia, while in the meantime two gangsters are obsessively looking for Hugo and the money.On a thematic level (the exploration of greed and its effects on people), Shallow Grave is hardly original, yet Boyle manages to compensate this by creating a suitably eerie atmosphere and alternating moments of shock and laughter. This is also due to the great cast, the director and writer's decision to focus solely on the leading trio proving both a weakness and a stroke of genius the weakness lies in the fact that no back-story is provided, thus giving no information on the exact nature of the bond these people and no explanation to their behavior in some sections of the movie; in addition, all the other characters who show up, particularly the two gangsters, are quite hollow, their presence having only the purpose of moving the events forward, leaving a good actor like Peter Mullan, for example, with no real material to work on (although, in retrospect, that can be forgiven by Boyle's wise decision to give him a larger role in Trainspotting). On the other hand, constantly keeping the eye on the three leads is a brilliant idea, given how satisfying the performances are, especially the contrast between Eccleston's coldness and McGregor's carefree vitality (another hint of things to come), while Fox remains in the middle, willing to have fun but more rational and subtle than her accomplice. It is the work of these three terrific actors, as well as the short running time and consistent pace, that keep Shallow Grave interesting and smart throughout, with little time to stop and think about minor flaws. And that goes without mentioning the superb conclusion, which I cannot spoil of course.

It can be loved by the audience and disliked by critics. George Romero was asked once why has he chosen to restrict his career to a genre not favored by critics. His answer was that he never saw himself as working in a genre other than horror.Many typical slasher movies have been released where a bunch of teenagers get it. Most of these films got mixed with the rest of the crowd of nonsense horror and forgotten. In 1985 along came re-animator a horror film so unique, bizarre and disturbing it just had to become a classic. From my point of view the brilliance of re-animator lies not in its over-the-top gore or its black humor but in the plot. Scientists have always been interested in prolonging life. Think about the pseudoscience called alchemy, (chemistry's predecessor) the main objective of an alchemist was inventing an elixir that prolonged life indefinitely. Re-animator is the impersonation of this idea. Conquering death has been in the minds of people since the dawn of time.As far as the gore goes well, I see it as the disastrous consequences of playing God. While Dr Hill (I think that's his name) was alive he did not pursue Barbara due to society's norms and rules. Herbert West's so called re-agent brought back his ID (demand for gratification) not the ego (social conscience), thus turning him into a monster.It is not very clear who the villain is in re-animator. Herbert West is simply an obsessed scientist who wishes to help humanity. All that is inhumane about his actions is the single premeditated murder of Dr Hill, who then becomes the actual villain.William Friedkin, the director of the exorcist said that a film should inspire and provoke you, which is exactly what re-animator does through its disturbing nudity and gore and the quite big content of accurate science.

This would ordinarily not be a weakness as it would permit virtually anyone to connect with his characters.The problem is that Kevin Smith apparently has failed to see his characters Jay and Silent Bob as being real people with real problems. This not only dehumanizes them, but it strips away almost all of the material that Smith is capable of turning into either plot or humor. The film is consequently lacking both in plot, character, and humor. Smith cannot write based purely upon fantasy without that connection to reality and to human experience. It seems very odd to see that Smith has failed to get under the skin of Jay and Silent Bob, considering how much these characters have added to other films that Smith has made, and for that matter, considering that Smith plays Silent Bob himself, but apparently Jay and Silent Bob are 'spice' characters in the 'dish' of Kevin Smith movies; seemingly vital and adding an enormous amount, but utterly incomplete on their own. Instead of a tasty meal, the viewer of this film is presented with a set of salt and pepper shakers!The film is so lacking in plot that Smith has apparently attempted to make it a spoof of Hollywood, but this attempt fails miserably. Rather than spoofing Hollywood, the film effectively refers to it. This film contains the worst spoof elements that I have seen in any commercial film, up to and including the atrocious Date Movie.

These stories reveal the political, social, and economical reconstruction evolving in Japan during the 1950s. The cinematic elements portray the dilapidation of Rashomon not only in the set but also by the actor's clothing, for example the rags worn by the bandit and Tajomaru. The idea that humans are evil and corrupt beings and the world we live in might as well be hell provides the central theme of the movie. The individual tales told within the structure of the larger story of the day, waiting for the rain to subside inside the gates of Rashomon. The conflict between an individual and their own conscious, perceive the nature of human beings to be weak and corrupt, this realization takes heed through the recounts of each character. Verification to the priest that the world we live in is a state of decay. Furthermore, it is ironic that the bandits reveal most of the moral lessons and insights on human behavior in the movie. For instance when Tajomaru recalls that if not for the wind, he would not have killed Takehiro that day, maybe it was because he only caught a glimpse of her that he felt the urge to follow them. Another illustration of irony, in the movie, occurs when Tajomaru takes Masako to her husband. Tajomaru almost looks ashamed. In addition, it is ironic that Tajomaru would even worry about killing someone honorably. Yet, this reveals the mentality of Japanese society in the 1950s. Moreover, the conversation between the Bandit and the Priest reveals the tendency for dishonest people to generate significance of a message to obtain what they want. Although, in the same instance the bandit tells the priest he does not want to hear his sermons. The bandit informs them that it is human to lie, that half the time we are not honest with ourselves, let alone others. Whereas, the priest tries to unveil that men are weak and this is their reason for lying. The bandit also points out, that maybe even the thought of good things is a farce and man wants to forget the bad stuff and believe in the make-believe good stuff. Beyond, the medium tells Takehiro's side of the story, revealing the mentality and nature of Japan in the 1950s. Considering the fact that a medium's testimony is valid in their political hearings at the courthouse, demonstrates the Japanese beliefs in the supernatural or ancestral realm. The medium also reveals the nature of forgiveness, how Tajomaru asking him what to do with his wife, makes Takehiro want to pardon him for his crime. Additionally, the woodcutter's account of the situation relates the nature of the Japanese to change their opinion of someone close to them. This occurs when Masako wants Tajomaru to kill her husband due to shame and describes her opposition to living her mundane life. Rashomon is definitely worth watching, and helps portray the outlook the Japanese have on the world and what they consider important. For the westerners that watch this movie remember it is not always the words that can tell a story, and at times one might wish the movie would move quicker, but just a thought, take that time to inquire about what has happened thus far.

Adventurer-archaeologist Indiana Jones barely escapes with his life from the opening adventure with blowsy nightclub singer Willie Scott and street urchin Short Round in tow. After an airplane mishap, they find themselves stranded in India and coerced into searching for sacred stones being used by a Thuggee cult.If anything, this entry seems more exotic than its predecessor. While the screenplay does not have the intelligence of Raiders and is all too willing to sacrifice believability for thrills, then one must also admit that the film is paced like a speeding bullet and it is only after it concludes that anyone is really given the breathing space to notice its flaws. The all-stops-out roller-coaster thrill ride which keeps attempting to top itself is well within keeping to the genre to which it pays its respects.Technically the film is very much at the same level as Raiders, although there were a few visual effects that could have used touching up. The Thuggee cult of India is an interesting choice of villains and Amrish Puri's malevolent priest Mola Ram is rather intimidating. Ford virtually owns the Indiana Jones role by now and has the audience's support and willingness to go along on another adventure almost immediately. Although I really miss Karen Allen for this outing, I don't find Kate Capshaw at all the detriment that many insist. I credit director Spielberg and producer Lucas for trying a completely different route and presenting us with a daffy prima donna with a hilariously shrill scream that cannot cope with bugs or dirt and suddenly finds herself thrust into an adventure that includes all that and more. Ke Huy Quan is also quite effective, if overused, as Short Round. He seems to help move the plot forward without falling into the aren't I cute school of child acting. My largest complaint is that in the second half when Capshaw's character starts becoming more reliable they should have transferred some of Quan's proactive action scenes to her. As it stands, Quan does increasingly ridiculous fight scenes, which could have easily gone to making the female lead more accessible.At the end of the day, it is a worthy prequel and deserves its spot in the pantheon of action films. I find it a more rewarding viewing experience than the third film in the series.

As it stands, Quan does increasingly ridiculous fight scenes, which could have easily gone to making the female lead more accessible.At the end of the day, it is a worthy prequel and deserves its spot in the pantheon of action films.

Adventurer-archaeologist Indiana Jones barely escapes with his life from the opening adventure with blowsy nightclub singer Willie Scott and street urchin Short Round in tow. After an airplane mishap, they find themselves stranded in India and coerced into searching for sacred stones being used by a Thuggee cult.If anything, this entry seems more exotic than its predecessor. While the screenplay does not have the intelligence of Raiders and is all too willing to sacrifice believability for thrills, then one must also admit that the film is paced like a speeding bullet and it is only after it concludes that anyone is really given the breathing space to notice its flaws. The all-stops-out roller-coaster thrill ride which keeps attempting to top itself is well within keeping to the genre to which it pays its respects.Technically the film is very much at the same level as Raiders, although there were a few visual effects that could have used touching up. The Thuggee cult of India is an interesting choice of villains and Amrish Puri's malevolent priest Mola Ram is rather intimidating. Ford virtually owns the Indiana Jones role by now and has the audience's support and willingness to go along on another adventure almost immediately. Although I really miss Karen Allen for this outing, I don't find Kate Capshaw at all the detriment that many insist. I credit director Spielberg and producer Lucas for trying a completely different route and presenting us with a daffy prima donna with a hilariously shrill scream that cannot cope with bugs or dirt and suddenly finds herself thrust into an adventure that includes all that and more.

French critics and other European Critics consider Under Capricorn as one of the best films from Hitchcock.Helen Simpson's book Under Capricorn was published a year before Rebecca was published. In the novel, We see the idea of tormented wife, and trouble causing housekeeper just like we see in this film. But this film is very different from the Helen Simpson's Under Capricorn.Alfred Hitchcock made his own adaptation with Hume Cronyn and Screenplay was written by Playwright James Bridie.But the film is much more stronger due to strong script and great performances. The problem is people try to see this film as a thriller. Its not a thriller. Its a drama with some thrilling moments.James Bridie (along with Alfred Hitchcock) wrote the screenplay in such a way where 4 characters (Charles, Sam, Lady Henrietta, Milly) are so alike.Charles Adare and Lady Henrietta belong to the higher class. While Sam and Milly belong to the lower class. The mind of Charles Adare is filled with shameful emptiness. Charles Adare says to Henrietta I spent most of my life warding off boredom. Charles Adare wanting to recreate Hattie as if she were still young Hattie Considine, he desires his own form of second chance, to return to the point in the past where he might start afresh, without the shameful emptiness of his adventures so far. So he is looking for redemption just like Henrietta and Sam. Alcoholism represents the shame of Lady Henrietta.Charles Adare is also like Milly. Charles Adare loves Henrietta. And he tries to take her away from Sam. Milly loves Sam. And she tries to take away Sam from Lady Henrietta. As for Milly and Lady Henrietta, they both love Sam. They are willing to do anything for Sam. Lady Henrietta killed Dermot to save Sam's life. Milly tries to kill Lady Henrietta, because she believes Lady Henrietta is only making Sam's life miserable. Milly doesn't feel any sympathy towards Lady Henrietta just like Lady Henrietta didn't have any feelings towards her brother Dermot.As you all know, Lady Henrietta's request to Sam to let Milly go at the end is an act of forgiveness.Milly makes the audience realize certain things that we aren't aware of. Here is an example. When Lady Henrietta says something like this at the end of the film - what kind of love drives you to make such horrible things to do..., after she finds out that Milly tries to kill her. And Lady Henrietta says when we speak of the love, we don't mean same thing. And she asks Milly Why did you want to kill me? Do you think he could love a murderess? And immediately Milly replies He married one. I think that's when Milly makes Lady Henrietta and us realize something - Lady Henrietta killed her brother Dermot to save Sam from getting killed. Milly requests Sam to stay with her, because Sam will be done for (if he returns to Ireland with Lady Henrietta). To save his life, Milly tried to kill Lady Henrietta. She makes the decision to kill Lady Henrietta only after Sam makes his mind to go to Ireland with Lady Henrietta. So Milly and Lady Henrietta are so alike. Through forgiving Milly, Lady Henrietta gets her redemption. And through forgiving Sam, Charles Adare gets his redemption.Both Sam and Milly are alike, because of their crippling inferiority complex. We see Sam's inferiority complex especially when he finds out that no women came for the dinner feast at his house. Later, when Milly gives Sam the impression that Charles Adare is trying to take away Lady Henrietta from him, the inferiority complex rises again. For Example, Sam angrily says this to Charles at the ball at Government house - I am not good enough to stand beside my wife... This is the same case with Milly. Remember what Milly said to Sam at the end - Oh no, Mr. Flusky. I am not good enough for you. I know that. I am only good enough to work for you and slave for you and look after your drunken..

Basically Gilbert Grape (Johnny Depp) lives in Endora, where not much happens, with his quite unusual family. He has an obese 36 stone mother Bonnie (500 pound weighing Darlene Cates), two sisters, Amy (Laura Harrington) and Ellen (Mary Kate Schellhardt), and a very close and inescapable bond with his mentally handicapped autistic brother, Arnie (Oscar nominated, and then unknown Leonardo DiCaprio). Gilbert's life is almost stolen from him by having to look after his family, particularly Arnie, but stranded free spirit Becky (Juliette Lewis) who gives him more feelings. Also starring Escape to Witch Mountain's (the crap one) Kevin Tighe as Ken Carver, The River Wild's John C. Reilly as Tucker Van Dyke and Crispin Glover as Bobby McBurney. The only giggle I laughed at was the car driving with half almost on the ground (because of the mother), there are many serious issues as well, e.g. coping with mental handicapped people, extreme obesity and losses. The most memorable moments, good and bad, are the mother being stared at (and photographed!) when leaving the police station, Gilbert striking Arnie, and the mother's tragic death after Arnie's 18th birthday (the doctor's predicted he'd die at 10) and being cremated in the house instead of having more starers see her lifted by a crane. As the only Oscar nominated was for DiCaprio's extraordinary and believable performance, he could have won it (he lost it to Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive). Leonardo DiCaprio was number 94, and Johnny Depp number 22 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was also number 9 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 2 on The World's Greatest Actor.

During his career, he made many brilliant films with amazing characterizations (such as DR. STRANGELOVE, BEING THERE, THE MOUSE THAT ROARED and many others), but he also did a lot of amazingly limp films that he practically slept through (THE FIENDISH PLOT OF FU MANCHU and THE PRISONER OF ZENDA). AFTER THE FOX is unusual in that it isn't exactly brilliant but still is very good. As far as Sellers' performance goes, he did a lovely Italian accent and his character was pretty credible, though despite being the star of the film, he wasn't the standout performer (I think this was actually Victor Mature--doing a wonderful self-parody).The Fox is a master criminal who escapes from prison rather easily in order to keep his sister out of trouble. At first, he thinks she's become a prostitute, but later he finds she's become (horrors) and actress!! Interestingly enough, his sister is played by Sellers' real-life wife, Britt Ekland and his love interest in the film was played by an unknown (but beautiful) Italian. Once out of prison, he learns about a big caper from Akim Tamiroff--smuggling in millions of dollars worth of gold into Italy. So, inspired by his sister's desire to be a movie star, he decides to make a fake film and use this as the cover to smuggle in the gold--and this is how Victor Mature comes into the film. He plays a parody of himself but is very vain and over the hill--telling everyone he's in his thirties even though he's pushing 60! I loved how he insisted he was so young when it was so obvious he wasn't--especially in the scene where Britt throws herself at him and runs her fingers through his hair--only to have them stained black by hair dye. Plus, he was so full of himself that he was gullible enough to believe he was making an art film when in fact Sellers and his gang obviously had no idea what they were doing.By the way, how Sellers got all the film equipment was pretty interesting. As the film was directed by Vittorio DeSica, he himself appeared in a small scene. He and his crew were filming some Egyptian epic when suddenly the wind machines turned on at full blast. When they were finally turned off, all the equipment--even DeSica's platform and cameras--were missing--stolen by Sellers' gang.Throughout the film there were many cute moments, but also towards the end the film did lag a bit and the ending seemed to be a bit of a letdown. I especially became bored with the chase scene and the ensuing courtroom scene. Still, it was original and moderately funny with some excellent performances.By the way, the film clip we see of a younger Victor Mature in an older black and white film was from EASY LIVING--one of Mature's better films.

As time goes on, we see Rhodes for what he really is a soulless shell of a human being desperate for power and God-like status. He's an obnoxious, drunken, selfish, opportunistic, womanizing lout who's on the bottom of the totem pole of human decency and morals. Most shocking of all? Lonesome Rhodes, one of cinema's most realistic, repugnant villains, is played by Andy Griffith.That's right, Andy Griffith. The beloved TV icon best known as wholesome, laid back country boy Andy Taylor on The Andy Griffith Show, screams, yells, leers, laughs maniacally, throws tantrums, and shows a frightening array of ugly emotions in a performance that actually rivals Humphrey Bogart's as Fred C. Dobbs in Treasure of the Sierra Madre. It's a shame that Griffith has been pigeonholed by his classic TV show. A Face in the Crowd could prove to any skeptic that Andy Griffith is really, truly, an honest-to-God ACTOR. He initially plays Rhodes as a slovenly, deceptively innocent hick from the sticks. When he is given a shot at fame by ambitious talent scout Marcia Jeffries (Patricia Neal), Rhodes milks it for all it's worth. It starts out all in good fun, but as his star rises, his morals plummet dramatically, and poor Marcia is forced to bear the burden of knowing she's helped create this monster.I also must take my hat off to Ms. Neal, an underrated actress and master of slow-burning intensity. She eschews common acting choices for ones that really feel painfully real. For instance, in one scene where Rhodes has hurt her yet again, she slowly approaches her bed. Instead of the predictable falling down on the bed and crying, Neal lets out one tortured, anguished sob and walks away, a crushed woman. It's acting at its most devastatingly honest.Elia Kazan creates a scorching, brutal indictment of the media age and the corrupting power of celebrity.

As Mel, the pragmatic writer played by Walter Matthau tells Marcia, we the people are responsible for a celebrity's power. It when we see through them, that's our strength, he says.

Instead he just tells this story of a group of outlaws this Wild Bunch who face the reality of their actions leading up to the point where they no longer find what they do compelling and in a final gesture of conscience, they decide to do what's right. In those moments before the epic finale we see Pike question himself as he drinks from the nearly empty bottle of whiskey while sitting on an old bed in a run-down shack. He questions his whole life, practically comparing it with the empty bottle in hand. That moment seals it, he knows what he must do, he knows he won't live through it, but it doesn't matter his time is over. The land had changed but Pike couldn't, they all couldn't.

I truly doubt anyone could have done it better than Holden. When it comes to the other aspects of the movie, Sam Peckinpah continues to excel. His direction is bloody and vicious, has more in common with an war movie. Action scenes are a battlefield where innocents are often caught in between the line of fire.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Western"},{"date":"1 May 2007","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Rashomon. When the movie first opens in which seems to be a rundown house, it has a very slow storyline, but after the first 20 minutes, I was drawn into the story and found myself thinking ahead trying to figure out the mystery that was going on. The movie seems to take place in the past, but I can only assume this because the people were using samurai swards and getting around by foot and horses. The acting in Rashomon was different, but not necessarily bad. You must remember to watch this movie with an open mind, and realize that it is completely different than American movies during this same time period. The editing and framing was pretty much what one would expect from an older movie, and did not affect the film in any negative way. Like I mentioned earlier, the plot seemed to develop kind of slowly, but picks up about half way through the film when you started to get different stories on the murder and tragedy that has happened. For being a movie from the fifties, I was quite surprised with the details of the characters conflict.To my pleasant surprise, I really enjoyed Rashomon. This story has many valuable lessons to life in it that can still be used today. It addresses the cruel nature of man and the way we are deceitful to fulfill our greed. I only had a few problems with the movie. First was the slow pace that it moved in. Although interesting, when the last man who actually witnessed the murder tells his story, I was still trying to figure out what the real point of the movie or message of the movie was. Eventually I figured it out, but after a couple this has to be over soon quotes. Next I found the wife of the murdered man to be extremely annoying. She cries in 3\/4th of the scenes she is in. And finally there was a random baby at the end of the movie to prove that there was still good in some men. I think that this could have been accomplished in another way. The baby just appeared and it was kind of awkward. Overall, Rashomon was a good film, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys older movies.
