Sometimes when you make a movie that is meant to be tragic, metaphorical, profound and\/or moving, it only makes it worse when the movie is a failure. To be honest, while I quite like the first two movies in the series I think they're somewhat overrated. Trying to glorify the mob is an immoral and futile cause. The good thing about the first two movies is that they manage to encompass all of the sins humans are commonly affiliated with- anger, pride,greed etc, and put them in an emphatically harsh context. Namely, that of a life and death situation. Sins that are normally unimportant domestically, ironically become a major problem because of domesticity - the family. This particular installment attempts to recreate this sentiment, but gets it all wrong. I actually laughed at the ending. It was a poor attempt at trying to move the audience and blatantly duplicates the endings of the last two movies for the sake of it(i.e. all the enemies being wiped out). The difference being, this time perhaps karma has brought about the emotional downfall of Michael, then, it is exemplified in a physical context-that of the accidental assassination of his daughter. My biggest gripe outside of the ending is quite simply the build up. It is somewhat confused and misdirected yet almost lacking in complexity. You feel nothing at all by the time we reach the climax which is then a rampant anti climax in itself. I can't believe they focused also, on an incestuous relationship as the chief romance. There is something very unnatural about the whole film. All due respect should go to the actors who give a reasonable performance despite the poor script. I think though, that it was a matter of misinterpretation of how good the script really was for actors such as Pacino and Keaton which is why they were forced to be associated with this movie.

Hitchcock's The Birds was one such film. Through suspense and mystery, The Birds leaves the viewer terrified. One of the greatest devices Hitchcock utilised was to not tell the viewer what the problems were, they are simply presented for the audience to react. No one can explain at first why giant flocks of birds are flying around madly. It is left to the audience to piece together the story.And a good mystery it is too. For some reason birds of all kinds are flying around terrorizing everything and everyone in sight. Perhaps the mysterious stranger in town could explain the happenings? But as with all Hitchcock, things are not always what they seem. The scenes involving birds were incredibly ahead of their time. Even today in this age of computers and special effects, this film still matches up and also, contains an overwhelming simplicity which is sometimes lost today. Real birds, fake birds and brilliant camera work combine to provide very dark imagery.  The lack of score gives the film a scary silence and helps to accentuate the spine chilling calls of the flocks of birds. The film also relies on the feats of nature, the ability of the birds to haunt people with their incredible grouping together. Overall The Birds is a mastery of cinema, made by a master of his craft. Interestingly, the film represents a deviation from Hitchcock's normal stories. The mystery of human behaviour is replaced by the mystery of animal behaviour.

Certainly one of the most daring movies ever made, FC never backs down or pulls any punches, but constantly pushes the envelope. It's a love-it-or-hate-it affair, but whatever your feelings, you can't deny the dazzling technical skill displayed by David Fincher. The camerawork and editing is first rate, although perhaps a bit too flashy at times.The acting is pretty damn good. Brad Pitt delivers his most memorable performance (his best since 12 Monkeys), and Edward Norton is simply superb. He is one of the great actors of our time. Helena Bonham Carter also comes off brilliantly. I found her both attractive and repulsive-a VERY difficult balance to pull off.Once, I took a mass media class, and they showed this awful video showing two crabby old men whining about how much violence there is in the media. I can only imagine what they would say about FC, they would certainly seperate content and context and miss the point entirely. It's very violent, yes, but it's not there for it's own sake. It's a statement on alienation and miscontent in today's society.

Certainly one of the most daring movies ever made, FC never backs down or pulls any punches, but constantly pushes the envelope. It's a love-it-or-hate-it affair, but whatever your feelings, you can't deny the dazzling technical skill displayed by David Fincher. The camerawork and editing is first rate, although perhaps a bit too flashy at times.The acting is pretty damn good. Brad Pitt delivers his most memorable performance (his best since 12 Monkeys), and Edward Norton is simply superb. He is one of the great actors of our time. Helena Bonham Carter also comes off brilliantly. I found her both attractive and repulsive-a VERY difficult balance to pull off.Once, I took a mass media class, and they showed this awful video showing two crabby old men whining about how much violence there is in the media. I can only imagine what they would say about FC, they would certainly seperate content and context and miss the point entirely. It's very violent, yes, but it's not there for it's own sake. It's a statement on alienation and miscontent in today's society.

Part of me feels repelled by the graphic violence (I winced several times), but another part wishes I'd directed it myself.The film has been compared to A Clockwork Orange. Granted, it's not quite as good, but it sure sticks in your mind, I'll give it that.

But all I got was the 'shock' ending...The basic problem is that this is a movie which seems unable to decide what it wants to say, and says whatever it does say (hard to tell what that is) badly. Great acting does not save a bad script full of characters I can't care about.Now maybe if I didn't moonlight in the movie industry I'd be shocked to discover the dumb politics and exploitation going on behind the screen, but as it is my feelings are as summed up above 'Ho Hum'.2\/10... would have been 1\/10 if it weren't for the acting and the paper cut scene.

First off Gary Sinise looks, and acts, very uncomfortable playing the head villain. He's a good actor, but this role is underwritten and he doesn't really play villains all that well. Charlize Theron was actually pretty good. I've never liked her before, but this role seems to fit her perfectly (especially at the end). Biggest problem with this movie is Ben Affleck. Yeah, he's very cute and a very good actor...but not for an action movie. His acting style is low key and he's not exactly muscular--an action film needs a physically and emotionally imposing actor--that isn't Affleck! The scenes when he had a gun in his hand actually drew a few snickers from my audience--he just looks so out of place with a gun! All together the movie was unexciting, unfunny (even though it tries to be) and just plain boring at times. Worth a video rental MAYBE. However, there is a hot sex scene between Affleck and Theron.
