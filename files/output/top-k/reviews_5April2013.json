Really, it is that bad. I do not have to talk about how beautiful the decors are, or were for that matter (we are 30 years on and it's quite impressive for the time it was shot), and even better looking than some of the earlier CGI movies. But who cares if the movie plot is totally ridiculous and sucks in every way possible. The reviews i have read here are all completely beyond me. How can people possibly overlook all the gaps in the plot. No character building whatsoever. Bad acting, unbelievable and ridiculous storyline. And it's not mediocre. No it's just all bad. Deckard's hunt for the replica's? I don't believe him, nor do i believe all of the other characters who feel totally forced into roles and extremely bad writing. It's beyond me how someone can get sucked in to this movie nor the protagonist. There is no hunt. There is no excitement. Nothing is thrilling. And o my god how predictable can a movie be??? Not to mention the agonizingly stupid view on the future. I don't want to play captain hindsight here but the movie is set in 2019. Which makes it even more painful to watch. Flying cars everywhere but then stopping for a payphone?! I could have handled this if the movie was done better. I mean i like Sci-Fi, but not this kind. Everything is dark, the streets should be crowded but are all empty. And the so called 'decors' they look like decors. Normally i wouldn't write a review because everyone has already done it and there is just not much to add to all the reviews already written.

Two very different movies but let's talk about The Mummy. An ancient, evil, mummy comes back to life to revive his dead girlfriend while terrorizing Brendan Fraser and Rachael Weisz, I'm OK with that. The Mummy is an entertaining experience and goes down as one of my favorite movies as a kid.In the beginning there is a prologue showing Prince Imhotep and Anck Su Namun and their forbidden love story in the ancient city Hamunaptra. It is really interesting and the visuals of ancient Egypt and the story really sucked me in. I love a good prologue and the opening scenes to this movie were strong. Characters were introduced well with their first impressions. Imhotep is a clever villain. O'Connell is the level headed, strong, leader. Jonathan is the witty idiot who provides comedic relief, and Evy is the beautiful genius. The characters are cliché but for the goal of the movie it works. The plot is basic, acting is OK, and the special effects\/action scenes are above average. The Mummy, for 1999 was a good movie but it is easily forgotten.Brendan Frasier plays Rick O'Connell and this is the best performance of his career, and that really isn't saying much. He is the standard superhuman who can do anything. He is smart, strong, handsome, and everything somebody wants in a hero. He wasn't a mindless action star because this isn't an action movie, thank god, so he has character development and is way different from the beginning compared to the end. He has his one-liners, he has his witty comments and funny moments, and sometimes they work really well, and sometimes it's painful to watch. When he first sees the mummy he freaks, says something stupid, shoots it in the face, and runs. That didn't work whatsoever. It was a typical one-liner that makes the hand smack the forehead. Then there is a moment where he yells at another mummy and it is his battle cry. The mummies respond and the look on his face was great before he runs away. I loved it, I laughed and it worked. Halfway into the movie we leave the desert and move to Cairo. This is where I expected the movie to slow down and become really boring, but it didn't. I loved most scenes in Egypt with the bugs that eat people and the digging in then tombs. That is all interesting to me and I almost wanted to go back. In Cairo, the movie gets really good because Imhotep needs to regenerate and seeing him slowly become human again, and by human I mean having skin and not a decaying corpus, was really cool and scary. The visuals of the ½ man ½ mummy were really cool. I love the visual of a bug crawling across his face and it crawls into a hole in his cheek and Imhotep just bites down and eats the bug, brilliant. For the entire movie I was waiting for when I would get taken out of the experience and would be turned off, and that was the plane scene with Winston. He was a pointless character with a meaningless plot point. I know why he was in the movie and it does make sense but I just hate it. The whole scene with the giant sandstorm was just so stupid. I watched it just loathing it and wanting it to end as soon as possible. Then it just ends in the worst way possible. I won't spoil but if this scene was cut out the movie would have been no different. For my favorite character it is a split between Beni and Jonathan. Beni is the weasel who works with the devil to save his own life. He even admits it. It is better to be at the right hand of the devil then in his path. Every time I saw him I was waiting for somebody to kill him. There is no way he can possibly live and I was waiting for the bullet to the head, or the sword in the stomach, or even the mummy tearing him to shreds. Needless to say his character is very entertaining; we feel emotion towards him and is the wildcard in the movie. Jonathan is just straight up funny. He is dumb but had flashes of brilliance. He is kind of a sidekick but I enjoy seeing him on screen and his charisma adds a nice charm to the movie. This isn't a good movie without Jonathan or Beni in it.Overall, The Mummy is a good movie. It isn't a classic, but it isn't awful either. I liked the movie and every time it's on I will watch it. I can hop in at any point and have fun watching it. There is really nothing special about it, positive or negative. The CGI and special effects weren't groundbreaking. The acting won't win any awards, it's just a fun movie to watch and enjoy it for what it is. As for a grade, it's tough. It isn't good enough for an Honorable Mention, but isn't bad enough for an A For Effort. It is somewhere in the middle. I know, The Mummy gets the WillyT Recommendation. I recommend this movie to anybody who wants a decent movie to watch with friends and enjoy the story and action. Don't expect the best movie ever but don't expect garbage either. Just expect The Mummy.

This movie has captured the soul of my youth; I loved it as a teen and I loved it even more as an adult.This movie is an absolute must see and if you haven't seen it yet, this is going to be an informative yet spoiler-free review from a fan's perspective.The atmosphere, the hilarious one-liners, the appealing conflict, its strong character development, the witty writing, the inspiring directing of it all, the ideal cast who played believable characters (except for Vicky & Heather, who are both one-dimensional, but the rest did an amazing job), these are the strengths that I hold dear to my heart.Our story revolves around the raunchy misadventures of four horny friends that are on the quest to get laid. Will they succeed? What tactics will they use to get the women of their choice in bed? What are their strengths and weaknesses? When is the deadline for getting laid? Which guy gets which girl? All of these questions will be answered once you sit down to watch this movie, after reading this.Every time I watch it, I wish my high school life was as spectacular as it's portrayed. The diverse characters enhance the experience of watching it. Of course, everybody knew a Stifler and the male audience can relate to Jim, our protagonist, and his struggles throughout his journey.I hope this review was helpful and if I could rate it higher than a 10\/10 (10 out of 10), I would.

The film basically is about a deadly virus that initially plagues California and then spreads to other areas of America and Dustin Hoffman and his team of Army personnel have to determine who or what is causing it. This film packs a perfect blend of drama, humour and tension so it does have a bit of something for everyone. What elevates this film is its strong script, excellent acting (particularly Dustin Hoffman who has already proved himself to be a brilliant actor after his Oscar winning performance in Rain Man- a personal favourite film of mine which is definitely worth checking out if you haven't seen it). Another of the film's strengths is the interaction between the characters (the dialogue was great and never became dull) and I personally thought Hoffman and Spacey worked well together in this film. The only scene which didn't really ring true was the scene at the house in California where Hoffman and Gooding Jr send the little girl outside to coax the monkey out of the woods so that they could shoot it. What I couldn't understand is that they sent her outside with no protective clothing and no face mask (knowing or 'being pretty certain' that this monkey was the 'Host' which contains the virus). That seemed unrealistic to me. To sum up, Outbreak is an underrated film which deserves a much wider audience. This is an excellent thriller which is well worth your time. Enjoy!

Without these good performances, it could have been a boring movie with meaningless discussions in the jury room and in the court room. These talented actors bring life to the movies. The movie could edit out 5-10 minutes. It is a classic so it warrants watching. Otherwise, a bit slow.
