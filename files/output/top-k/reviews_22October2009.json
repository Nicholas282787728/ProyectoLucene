The Man with no Name is alongside Harry Callahan the character that most people think about when they hear the name Clint Eastwood, and this is definitely one of his best roles. Many have called it a corny and unimaginative character, I call it the contrary. The Man with no Name or Joe is one of the most enigmatic and clever roles ever conceived in the western genre. credit must also go to Sergio Leone for directing this great film, which has been imitated so many times in the following years, even by Clint Eastwood himself.This movie is one of the most famous Italo-Western movies, and was probably only overthrown by it's sequels. I must admit I was surprised when I read that this film was shot in Italy, the film was very authentic and believable and there's a reason it's called a Italo-Western movie.The only downside of this movie is if you watch the English dubbed version. Some voices can be really annoying, especially the child which was so obviously dubbed by and adult. Then again this is not Sergio Leones fault, I only mention this as a warning for you.The movie has obviously aged a bit, it has some uneven acting, and most of the dialogue has been dubbed, probably even in the original Italian version. But being from 1964, I won't down-rate it for it's age.I really don't have much more to say, I loved it. And this is a must see for all wester and Clint Estwood fan. Even if you aren't a fan, I advice you to see it. And as mentioned before i look forward to see the sequels. I give this movie a 8\/10.

When it puts its mind to it, there is no subject, no person, no concept, no artifact that Hollywood can't debase. In this instance they've managed by dint of great effort and skill to take Hitchcock's 1960 classic and turn it into a schlock slasher movie.All the characters are by now either crazy or terminally stupid. The plot consists of unordered incidents unconnected by any logic that you or I might recognize.This remake, released twenty-six years after the original, was hobbled from the outset by the fact that there is no secret to speak of. We already know that Norman Bates is impersonating his dead, stuffed mother. Therefore, there is no mystery about the goings on except to the extent that we are puzzled at all about why this movie was ever made.Tony Perkins as Norman seems to have lost his taste for investing any acting skills in his performance. He was quite good in the original. He had a boyish, birdlike charm about him, an oddball candor, that elicited sympathy in a viewer, even one who knew how murderous he might be underneath that mask of sanity. Here, he's simply weird from the outset, his face aged in a way that has transformed that pale vulnerability into a darker menace. He reads his lines in a constant sing-song with no values. The script gives him a few in jokes that don't begin to compensate for the recklessness of its commercial blight. Diana Scarwid as the young woman who challenges Mother's dominance over Norman has done fine work elsewhere (eg., Silkwood) but here is shackled by the role of a half-nutty and unsuspecting failed nun who has tried to commit suicide in one of the motel's cabins, a fate from which she is rescued by Norman. That provides the material for one of the in jokes. Scarwid I must have left the bathroom a mess. Perkins I've seen worse.

I have never seen anything that would ever surpass it. How wonderful every aspect of this movie is. From the lighting to the costumes to the scenes. Victor Flemming out did himself on this film in so many ways. Even though he made his mark directing films all the way from 1919-1956 this by far I believe to be the best film he had ever directed. (Gone with the wind, Joan of Arc, and Dr. Jekyl & Mr. Hyde are other classics of his- but in my opinion they are not in the same boat as this film!) From the moment the film started you were caught up with Dorthy Gale (Judy Garland) and cant take your eyes off her. So beautiful and innocent. For this film only being 101 minutes long it seems much longer because it was so detailed and vibrant. Even today if you watch the movie you still get caught up in it and end up loving it no matter who you are or what age. I also believed Margaret Hamilton (The Wicked Witch of the West) did such an amazing job. I watched this movie for probably the 100th time in my life and her character still shakes me up a little bit. I loved how the movie went from sepia tone and when the gates of oz opened up then it went into Technicolor. I thought that was such an amazing effect, especially for its time. The lighting and scenes in this movie are totally MGM (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) quality. Each scene, costume, lighting, character, is out of this world cool and back then so expensive. Bright lighting throughout the film showed how much money time and effort Fleming put into this film. Timeless classic, must see, life isn't complete without seeing it.

One of them is Rodriguez and Tarantino's From Dusk Till Dawn. Thought it is extremely Silly, Gory and so far into the red zone that it is at times just shy of black, the film not only delivers the goods, but it delivers them which a descent sense of black humour, a sensational make up effects job, and a cast of characters that you actually end up kind of liking more than one usually does with these movies (well some of them arn't so likable). Once you watch it, you'll know what I mean. If this is your thing and you haven't seen this flick yet, you really and truly should.It is a hot God damn day in Big Springs, Texas when the movie starts, Seth and Richard Gecko, are the most notorious bandits in the state and are responsible for the deaths of a good twenty people (both cops and civilians) After blowing up a liqueur store in scene one, they know they have to get over the border before the FBI get them (the Mexican border that is, not the Canadian). The Gecko Bros highjack a retired priest and his family who have a big RV, and devise a plan to get across. After they do, the gang heads for a bar with the degrading name Titty Twister.

What can you say when such a film loses several Oscars to -- God forbid -- Ben Hur?Simply said, Anatomy of a Murder is one of the greatest films of the 1950s. Even if you're not a fan of legal procedurals, there's something about this film that draws you in -- most likely because it is a film about the behavior of people who happen to be lawyers (and other court folk), rather than a film about talking heads with the title of lawyer. Wendell Mayes' screenplay takes the source novel, and fleshes out the characters to a point where you can trace the motives of the characters from their behavior, not from convenient dialogue. Indeed, the one true instance of character exposition -- Stewart's speech to the woman who may have been the victim's mistress --is less a matter of tacked-on exposition than a calculated strategy by Stewart's character to provoke a response. In doing so, Stewart creates one of the warmest, and best, monologues of the film.Likewise, director Otto Preminger fought fiercely to maintain the context of the novel by refusing to compromise on key elements of the underlying rape (or simply overeager coupling, depending on who you believe. Preminger's efforts are less a case of trying to keep scandalous (for the time) material in the film than insisting that key flashpoints for character motivation be maintained. Equally, Duke Ellington's noirish jazz score (as well as his cameo) lend texture and gravity to the proceedings.And then, there is Stewart's performance. Many prefer his work in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (a performance I've always found too naive to fully enjoy) or It's a Wonderful Life, or in the Anthony Mann westerns. For me, however, this performance combines the marvelous boyish sincerity of Mr. Smith, the world-weariness of his western characters, the moral ambiguity of Scottie Ferguson (Vertigo), the wit of his Margaret Sullavan comedies (The Shop Around the Corner), and the uncertainty under stress of George Bailey -- in other words, a career of experience and characters all brought to bear. The result is one of most superb performances of the 1950s (or, for that matter, the 1960s). Stewart would never again have another role like this -- and it's almost as if he knows it.Not that Stewart's performance is an isolated occurrence -- every supporting performance is as near perfect as can be Arthur O'Connell's insouciant partner; Eve Arden giving Thelma Ritter a run for her money as the loyal (and wisecracking) secretary; Murray Hamilton as a biased, but deeply human witness for the prosecution; Ben Gazzara's cipher of a defendant; Lee Remick's sultry (possible) victim; George C. Scott's brilliant legal fencer; and, perhaps most joyously, real lawyer Joseph Welch as the folksy judge -- laid back, but always in control.In other words, a film that should not be missed.

For me, however, this performance combines the marvelous boyish sincerity of Mr. Smith, the world-weariness of his western characters, the moral ambiguity of Scottie Ferguson (Vertigo), the wit of his Margaret Sullavan comedies (The Shop Around the Corner), and the uncertainty under stress of George Bailey -- in other words, a career of experience and characters all brought to bear. The result is one of most superb performances of the 1950s (or, for that matter, the 1960s). Stewart would never again have another role like this -- and it's almost as if he knows it.Not that Stewart's performance is an isolated occurrence -- every supporting performance is as near perfect as can be Arthur O'Connell's insouciant partner; Eve Arden giving Thelma Ritter a run for her money as the loyal (and wisecracking) secretary; Murray Hamilton as a biased, but deeply human witness for the prosecution; Ben Gazzara's cipher of a defendant; Lee Remick's sultry (possible) victim; George C. Scott's brilliant legal fencer; and, perhaps most joyously, real lawyer Joseph Welch as the folksy judge -- laid back, but always in control.In other words, a film that should not be missed.

What can you say when such a film loses several Oscars to -- God forbid -- Ben Hur?Simply said, Anatomy of a Murder is one of the greatest films of the 1950s. Even if you're not a fan of legal procedurals, there's something about this film that draws you in -- most likely because it is a film about the behavior of people who happen to be lawyers (and other court folk), rather than a film about talking heads with the title of lawyer. Wendell Mayes' screenplay takes the source novel, and fleshes out the characters to a point where you can trace the motives of the characters from their behavior, not from convenient dialogue. Indeed, the one true instance of character exposition -- Stewart's speech to the woman who may have been the victim's mistress --is less a matter of tacked-on exposition than a calculated strategy by Stewart's character to provoke a response. In doing so, Stewart creates one of the warmest, and best, monologues of the film.Likewise, director Otto Preminger fought fiercely to maintain the context of the novel by refusing to compromise on key elements of the underlying rape (or simply overeager coupling, depending on who you believe. Preminger's efforts are less a case of trying to keep scandalous (for the time) material in the film than insisting that key flashpoints for character motivation be maintained. Equally, Duke Ellington's noirish jazz score (as well as his cameo) lend texture and gravity to the proceedings.And then, there is Stewart's performance.

The word that makes up the title, suspicion, is composed of those two elements and Hitchcock was a master at them. The movie stars Joan Fontaine (who became the only actor or actress to win an Oscar in an Alfred Hitchcock-directed movie) as a charming, but shy young woman who becomes increasingly aware that her husband (Cary Grant) has become entangled in a wide variety of legal tie-ups. Her questions turn to fear as she becomes convinced he's planning to kill her.That was just the sort of story that would attract Alfred Hitchcock. He is the leading force in the movie, but those also due enormous credit are the two leading performers, who provide the glue that keeps this movie together even when its shockingly disappointing resolution comes up. Hitchcock was famous for taking leading men such as James Stewart and having them play the exact opposite of their usual idealistic characters. Like Stewart, Cary Grant was and still is famous for playing endlessly polite, charming, and likable leading men. It took the nerve that only Hitchcock had to not only make Grant into a suspicious character, but to believe that he could kill. This sparred a lot of controversy in the studio system at that time, but frankly, there's nothing they should have worried about. Not only is Grant very good in the movie, but having him play the opposite of his usual character personality was hands-down brilliant. If you want to frighten an audience or make them suspect (and thus generate fear of anticipation), give them a leading man whom you don't suspect. It would have all been too easy to suspect the husband if say Lon Chaney Jr. had taken the role. Because Grant is so charming and handsome and charismatic, somehow that makes him seem more lethal.And of course, I can't leave out Joan Fontaine, who gets second-billing to Grant due to promotional reasons but is really the star of the show. Fontaine, among Grace Kelly and Kim Novak, is one of Hitchcock's most professional and well-cast leading ladies in his movies. Like with any movie of this sort, Hitchcock knew he had to get the audience to identify with Fontaine. This is unusual for Hitchcock, for he oftentimes like to have his leading ladies somewhat icy and cold, controlling and deceiving the leading man. So by taking these two elements and casting the actors and playing the roles the opposite of how they would usually be treated, Hitchcock created a web of suspense that even today many people try to imitate.As I've mentioned before, the resolution to the picture disappoints, and this blame is due one-hundred-percent to the studio and not to Hitchcock or his screenwriters. Hitchcock's intended ending would have been the quintessential way to conclude the story, but that's Hollywood for you. Although the ending is a crop-out and a head-shaker that does not ruin the suspense and anticipation and enjoyment levels that were built up in the previous ninety-five minutes. This is an overlooked and rarely mentioned masterpiece. One of the master-filmmaker, Alfred Hitchcock's very best.

Only later did it begin to occur to me (and, of course, to many others) that there is possibly much more to Rosie than we (and Marco) are led to believe at the outset.Ms. Leigh was a major star when the film came out, so why would she be given such a relatively small supporting role? How, really, does she happen to be on that train to begin with? Why, indeed, do Rosie and Marco carry on this bewildering conversation? Are these two merely playing an insipid, meet-cute scene to soften the tone of an otherwise-consistently acerbic and caustic film for awhile, a film which never, otherwise, loses its satiric-tragic tone (and how many movies, short of RoboCop, to name one, are able successfully to present a sustained balance of satire and tragedy)? How can Rosie so precipitously jettison her fiancé without a second thought and with no apparent pain or regret? Is there, in their conversation, Marco's version of Shaw's trigger question, Why don't you pass the time by playing a little solitaire? When Marco proposes marriage, why does Rosie never unequivocally answer his question?Every character in the film is being somehow controlled by someone Dr. Yen, toeing the Party line he clearly views with contempt as being beneath his virtuosity and cunning; Raymond's mother, who has discovered to her horror (and, probably, delight), in a magnificent perversion of the pieta, that her own, only son had been given over to the Grand Plan and who then, straight from Macbeth, vows both complicity and revenge; Senator Iselin, a (willing?) pawn to Raymond's mother and (unwillingly?) to his alcoholism; Marco, enslaved by two PtSD triggers combat and brainwashing; but who remains a loyal Army officer saved (or later sacrificed?) by his beloved Rosie; Shaw, an unwilling pawn to brainwashing and (perhaps willingly) to his mother and who suffers from a third PtSD trigger incest, until he is saved (or would he, too, later have been sacrificed?) by his beloved Jocie (yes, the names rhyme), who, like Rosie, also appears seemingly out of nowhere with a superficially-insipid manner.It may just be that the film ends with the death of all the characters, even if some of them--up to the point the narrative stops--continue to walk and breathe.

Rule number two Watch 'Scream 2' and maybe even 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' then you may safely move onto 'Scary Movie.' I've seen 'Scream' multiple times, but 'Scary Movie' ('Scream's spoof) many more times. It's hard not to laugh throughout this viewing of 'Scream' remembering the hilarious scene-by-scene, line-by-line mock-ups in 'Scary Movie.' That being said, I do remember my first reaction to this movie 13 years ago at its premiere. What a fantastic movie and though it's an homage to previous slasher films (there has to be six dozen references, names, scenes, innuendos in 'Scream') it really reinvented the genre, leading itself into multiple and extremely poor quality rip-offs. In fact, as this brought back the slasher horror and gave it more intelligence, it also brought it back crashing down, harder than before with the horrid carbon copies following. The movie starts with a bang, and the horror references begin early. You think you're watching a Drew Barrymore film, but quickly it shifts to main character Sidney and her group of friends who get picked off one-by-one while everyone's a suspect. Director Craven (loved him as the janitor) has definitely hits\/misses (even see part 3 of this series) but his two most influential films &#x96; of my generation, that is &#x96; is 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' and 'Scream.' While this one's not perfect, it's a real gem, with great comedy, homage, great acting, horror; 'Scream' was an excellent balance of all the right elements to horror-comedy and a perfect teen-night-out. Sure, it's now dated, and teens now probably need a little more (thanks, 'Saw' and other torture porn) but anyone growing up in the genre should appreciate this.
