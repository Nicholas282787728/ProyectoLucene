","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"11 January 2004","score":"","review":"  (Written 7\/16\/02) **CONTAINS SPOILERS** Personally, I am a die hard horror fanatic..anyone who knows me should know this by now. They should also know that before I go see a sequel, I see all the movies prior to just to make sure they actually make sense in the connection. This 8th installment in the Halloween series does do a pretty okay job of picking up where the last one left off and explaining how he came back after he was supposedly decapitated in the last one (MUCH better continuity than Jason X had), but it was a crappy way of having Michael Myers just appear out of nowhere 3 years later.As far as scariness goes, this movie only proves that to get the TRUE effect of scary movies, you have to see it in a theater..widescreen, surround sound, all that stuff. Because if you see such a movie on video or DVD (or worse, cable), you're getting SOME of the great effects, but not the best. Anyhoo, I say this because its great to hear the footsteps behind you, the creepy breathing on your right, and of course the famous Halloween Theme (thank you John Carpenter for such brilliance!). Other sounds that can be heard around you are the sounds of dogs barking, crickets, and other night creatures that were added for effect. But as far as the scariness of the movie...I personally think it lacked individuality. It was obviously a cross between The Blair Witch Project and House on Haunted Hill. There was even a scene where the girl puts her camera up to her face and goes on about how scared she is (JUST LIKE IN BLAIR WITCH!). That must've been intentional..I can only hope and assume. And the whole 'staying the night in a haunted house' deal was done in House On Haunted Hill...twice. And this movie did give in to its classic serial killing based movies..killer jumps out of closets, appears out of nowhere, is standing behind an unsuspecting victim, etc. No surprise there, but due to the fact that the volume was so loud, everytime something or someone did jump out, the sound of the shrieking and whatnot would pierce my eardrums..maybe that was the theater screwing up or maybe just another way to give the movie extra pizazz in the scariness department..it wasn't scary..it was annoying and painful..but if it makes you happy, I will admit that I did jump because of such events.And now of course, we move on to blood, gore, killings, nudity, and all that great stuff that makes a horror movie great. Well, there was REALLY nothing more outside of the classic stabbing. Obviously, Michael Myers is not as creative as Jason Vorhees when it comes to murdering his victims. Stab here, stab there...maybe a hanging over here..a body crushing over there...more stabbing..in fact, it got really old..but then again, after seeing all 7 of the Halloween movies (even the ones that didn't have Michael Myers in it), stabbing is pretty much all you got (except in the second one where Michael burned the skin off of a nurse in a hot tub..that was pretty good). As for the blood and gore...eh, not too much of it, which I think is a good thing. Its a bad idea to overdue with the blood and stuff because then it doesn't look that real. However, there is only so much blood that can come out of a person's eyes, nose, and mouth...I guess. Not like I've ever seen anyone get murdered in such a manner before, so I don't know..it just didn't look believable anyway. As far as nudity goes..thankfully, it was kept at a minimal. There wasn't really any at all. This is good because I think that nudity and sex in horror movies is part of what makes a horror movie a horror movie, but its not necessary at all. Lets just stick to the basic goal of scaring people, not arousing them (but if sex and naked women do scare you, then I guess there is no problem then).AND NOW, THE ENDING...now, anyone who watches horror movies should know that they can get pretty ridiculous with the endings as well as leaving leeway for a sequel. Example In Jason Goes to Hell..Jason basically, well, went to hell. That was SUPPOSEDLY the end of the 'Friday the 13th' saga...of course he came back in Jason X, but they did a very CRAPPY job of picking up where the last one left off. They didn't even bother to explain how the crap Jason got from underground to a confinement prison! I guess that was the best move to make though considering that they were taking a chance by making another sequel to something that was supposedly over anyway. They would've gotten ridiculous with the explanation of how he mysteriously returned from the dead. Now, as far as Halloween Resurrection goes with its ending..I'd say 'been there, done that'. I don't want to spoil it, but I have to if I want to get my point across. In order to 'destroy' Michael Myers for the umpteenth time, the victims who managed to survive burned him alive..doesn't that sound a little cliched? Well, it is. IN FACT, thats the EXACT same way Michael was killed in Halloween 2...they poured gas on him and burned him..did he die? NO! SO WHY ARE YOU GOING TO TRY AND DO THE EXACT SAME THING AGAIN? Maybe the writers forgot about that or didn't care. I guess they figured, who actually pays attention to stuff like that? Well, news flash, its one of MY many passions of life to criticize horror movies. So, like I was saying..the ending was really redundant. As far as leaving room for a sequel, they did do that. Of course, we all know that Michael isn't REALLY dead (and I still am not sure why the people of Haddonfield haven't figured it out either that he ain't gonna die!). The last scene of the movie shows him in a body bag in a morgue..the coroner unzips the bag (ever so slowly for suspense reasons) of the supposedly dead serial killer (and guess what, I think they actually show his face..or maybe thats just the charred remains of the infamous mask). After a few seconds of the camera focusing on his face...BAM! His eyes snap open, and then the screen goes blank signaling the end of the movie and possibly the beggining of the 9th installment in the Halloween series. The whole eye snapping thing has been overworked in horror movies, but it actually seemed to fit in this one. Though the morgue scene made the movie go on longer than it needed to (it just seemed like they were trying to kill time by having it), it did make for a better ending.All and all, this movie was alright for a film that is doomed to bare a part 8 at the end of its title. It had its bad points, as well as some good. It had its points where you can tell whats going to happen next without a doubt...seriously, in one scene I thought to myself she is going to open the door and he is going to jump out with the knife and stab her and behold, I was right. I had to chuckle at myself for that. And also as predicted, there were 3 black people (or African Americans to be politically correct, but why should I be when its my own race I'm talking about?) in the movie. Its been said and joked about many a time how black people never survive in such movies. Well, that was proven wrong in House on Haunted Hill when Taye Diggs character survived in the end (along with his white female entorage). And just as Halloween Resurrection stole House on Haunted Hill's plot..it stole its ending. One black guy survives (Busta Rhymes's character), along with the white female lead whom which the little subplot there is focuses on. I did, however, catch myself doing something that I know shouldn't be done in a horror movie...I yawned during this movie. Maybe it was because I didn't get enough sleep, or maybe it was because it felt like the movie was just dragging along..it didn't have a real good pace to it...nor a real good plot, but thats automatically forgiven in the horror genre. I predict that if there is a Halloween Part 9, NONE of the surviving characters that were in this one will be in it. I've noticed that trend with horror movies. Example In Halloween H20, Jamie Lee Curtis's character, Laurie Strode, had a son (Josh Hartnett's character). Well, we hear NOTHING about this son at all in this movie. We assumed hes moved on and doesn't care that his mother was murdered in the insane asylum she was sent to for 3 years. This also brings back the fact that in Halloween 4, Laurie Strode had a daughter and not a son. I'm not sure what they did with that whole situation, but I've read somewhere that the producers wanted to forget that the movies Halloween 3-6 ever happened in order to focus on the Laurie Strode aspect of the story. That is understandable..we all make mistakes.

There wasn't really any at all. This is good because I think that nudity and sex in horror movies is part of what makes a horror movie a horror movie, but its not necessary at all. Lets just stick to the basic goal of scaring people, not arousing them (but if sex and naked women do scare you, then I guess there is no problem then).AND NOW, THE ENDING...now, anyone who watches horror movies should know that they can get pretty ridiculous with the endings as well as leaving leeway for a sequel. Example In Jason Goes to Hell..Jason basically, well, went to hell. That was SUPPOSEDLY the end of the 'Friday the 13th' saga...of course he came back in Jason X, but they did a very CRAPPY job of picking up where the last one left off. They didn't even bother to explain how the crap Jason got from underground to a confinement prison! I guess that was the best move to make though considering that they were taking a chance by making another sequel to something that was supposedly over anyway. They would've gotten ridiculous with the explanation of how he mysteriously returned from the dead. Now, as far as Halloween Resurrection goes with its ending..I'd say 'been there, done that'. I don't want to spoil it, but I have to if I want to get my point across. In order to 'destroy' Michael Myers for the umpteenth time, the victims who managed to survive burned him alive..doesn't that sound a little cliched? Well, it is. IN FACT, thats the EXACT same way Michael was killed in Halloween 2...they poured gas on him and burned him..did he die? NO! SO WHY ARE YOU GOING TO TRY AND DO THE EXACT SAME THING AGAIN? Maybe the writers forgot about that or didn't care. I guess they figured, who actually pays attention to stuff like that? Well, news flash, its one of MY many passions of life to criticize horror movies. So, like I was saying..the ending was really redundant. As far as leaving room for a sequel, they did do that. Of course, we all know that Michael isn't REALLY dead (and I still am not sure why the people of Haddonfield haven't figured it out either that he ain't gonna die!). The last scene of the movie shows him in a body bag in a morgue..the coroner unzips the bag (ever so slowly for suspense reasons) of the supposedly dead serial killer (and guess what, I think they actually show his face..or maybe thats just the charred remains of the infamous mask). After a few seconds of the camera focusing on his face...BAM! His eyes snap open, and then the screen goes blank signaling the end of the movie and possibly the beggining of the 9th installment in the Halloween series. The whole eye snapping thing has been overworked in horror movies, but it actually seemed to fit in this one. Though the morgue scene made the movie go on longer than it needed to (it just seemed like they were trying to kill time by having it), it did make for a better ending.All and all, this movie was alright for a film that is doomed to bare a part 8 at the end of its title. It had its bad points, as well as some good. It had its points where you can tell whats going to happen next without a doubt...seriously, in one scene I thought to myself she is going to open the door and he is going to jump out with the knife and stab her and behold, I was right. I had to chuckle at myself for that. And also as predicted, there were 3 black people (or African Americans to be politically correct, but why should I be when its my own race I'm talking about?) in the movie. Its been said and joked about many a time how black people never survive in such movies. Well, that was proven wrong in House on Haunted Hill when Taye Diggs character survived in the end (along with his white female entorage). And just as Halloween Resurrection stole House on Haunted Hill's plot..it stole its ending. One black guy survives (Busta Rhymes's character), along with the white female lead whom which the little subplot there is focuses on. I did, however, catch myself doing something that I know shouldn't be done in a horror movie...I yawned during this movie. Maybe it was because I didn't get enough sleep, or maybe it was because it felt like the movie was just dragging along..it didn't have a real good pace to it...nor a real good plot, but thats automatically forgiven in the horror genre. I predict that if there is a Halloween Part 9, NONE of the surviving characters that were in this one will be in it. I've noticed that trend with horror movies. Example In Halloween H20, Jamie Lee Curtis's character, Laurie Strode, had a son (Josh Hartnett's character). Well, we hear NOTHING about this son at all in this movie. We assumed hes moved on and doesn't care that his mother was murdered in the insane asylum she was sent to for 3 years. This also brings back the fact that in Halloween 4, Laurie Strode had a daughter and not a son. I'm not sure what they did with that whole situation, but I've read somewhere that the producers wanted to forget that the movies Halloween 3-6 ever happened in order to focus on the Laurie Strode aspect of the story. That is understandable..we all make mistakes.

They should also know that before I go see a sequel, I see all the movies prior to just to make sure they actually make sense in the connection. This 8th installment in the Halloween series does do a pretty okay job of picking up where the last one left off and explaining how he came back after he was supposedly decapitated in the last one (MUCH better continuity than Jason X had), but it was a crappy way of having Michael Myers just appear out of nowhere 3 years later.As far as scariness goes, this movie only proves that to get the TRUE effect of scary movies, you have to see it in a theater..widescreen, surround sound, all that stuff. Because if you see such a movie on video or DVD (or worse, cable), you're getting SOME of the great effects, but not the best. Anyhoo, I say this because its great to hear the footsteps behind you, the creepy breathing on your right, and of course the famous Halloween Theme (thank you John Carpenter for such brilliance!). Other sounds that can be heard around you are the sounds of dogs barking, crickets, and other night creatures that were added for effect. But as far as the scariness of the movie...I personally think it lacked individuality. It was obviously a cross between The Blair Witch Project and House on Haunted Hill. There was even a scene where the girl puts her camera up to her face and goes on about how scared she is (JUST LIKE IN BLAIR WITCH!). That must've been intentional..I can only hope and assume. And the whole 'staying the night in a haunted house' deal was done in House On Haunted Hill...twice. And this movie did give in to its classic serial killing based movies..killer jumps out of closets, appears out of nowhere, is standing behind an unsuspecting victim, etc. No surprise there, but due to the fact that the volume was so loud, everytime something or someone did jump out, the sound of the shrieking and whatnot would pierce my eardrums..maybe that was the theater screwing up or maybe just another way to give the movie extra pizazz in the scariness department..it wasn't scary..it was annoying and painful..but if it makes you happy, I will admit that I did jump because of such events.And now of course, we move on to blood, gore, killings, nudity, and all that great stuff that makes a horror movie great. Well, there was REALLY nothing more outside of the classic stabbing. Obviously, Michael Myers is not as creative as Jason Vorhees when it comes to murdering his victims. Stab here, stab there...maybe a hanging over here..a body crushing over there...more stabbing..in fact, it got really old..but then again, after seeing all 7 of the Halloween movies (even the ones that didn't have Michael Myers in it), stabbing is pretty much all you got (except in the second one where Michael burned the skin off of a nurse in a hot tub..that was pretty good). As for the blood and gore...eh, not too much of it, which I think is a good thing. Its a bad idea to overdue with the blood and stuff because then it doesn't look that real. However, there is only so much blood that can come out of a person's eyes, nose, and mouth...I guess. Not like I've ever seen anyone get murdered in such a manner before, so I don't know..it just didn't look believable anyway. As far as nudity goes..thankfully, it was kept at a minimal. There wasn't really any at all. This is good because I think that nudity and sex in horror movies is part of what makes a horror movie a horror movie, but its not necessary at all.

But Schwarzenegger can undeniably count sole proprietorship on two characters. The first, and undoubtedly the most famous, is the &#145;Terminator'. Who can ever begin to imagine any one else playing this role? Without him, the &#145;Terminator' franchise can only produce products based on the three movies. He is the franchise &#150; period. Then there is &#145;Conan'. If there ever were roles tailor made for an actor, these two were made for Schwarzenegger. Here was another story that could not continue without this star. The audience identified Arnold with the character. No &#150; one else would suffice.The obvious implication of the above statement is that Arnold was a huge contributor to the movies success. This together with the story &#150; albeit with some cheesiness &#150; and a powerful soundtrack helped to prevent the negative factors detracting from an entertaining movie. The detracting factors of note were the obligatory 80's cheesiness, weak special effects and hammed up acting. Oh, I almost forgot to mention the wigs. How can anyone ever forget those?The gargantuan presense of Arnold is all conquering from the moment we see him. He is perfect for the role. Besides fulfilling the physical appearance needs of the character with his obvious girth, he radiates the charisma of a leader. As in real life, the audience is in no doubt as to the fact that this is a man destined for greatness. His chiseled features and thick accent accentuate him as a mighty warrior with a deadly purpose. It also gives us the audience's visual pre &#150; conception of barbarians. The word barbarian conjures up an image of powerful warriors who ensured that their foes met with a bloody end. They were ruthless and justice was meted out with powerful swings of their oversized weapons. Their history has been more than glossed over with tales of fantasy and folklore. This is a fact that is also attributable to Arnold when we hear of stories of incredible feats in his bodybuilding days. The character thus demanded someone larger than life and Arnold fills the tag quite comfortably.The story tells of a man who when released from slavery, seeks revenge and embarks on a dangerous journey with many perils in the form of creatures of the night and fearless warriors. He befriends others as daring as himself and their combined talents draws the attention of the King whose daughter has been kidnapped by Conan's enemies. This is a classic version of the hero's journey where he rises from suppression against his enemies overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles and wreaks his revenge. This is a story that has mass appeal since most people feel suppressed by the system and would like to cause their own havoc in overcoming it. The resonance of the characters therefore has a real effect despite the fantasy aspect of the story.The mixture of characters is reminiscent of folklore, especially the barbarian's small sidekick. All knights and warriors have their dependable right hand man who is usually very much the second man. This is also evident in other media and I was particularly reminded of &#145;Slaine' from the 2000AD comic strip. It is this combination of characters that keeps the story moving forward with added interest. Each new character must add something different thus making a worthwhile contribution. This necessary element is well included here.Movies in this era were unfortunately burdened with obligatory cheesiness in order to have appeal to the audience. A concomitant factor to this is that the acting becomes hammed up. Although understandable from a financial point of view since movies have to be in tandem with the current trend, better scripting could have been used in order to retain the stories respectability. It would have also contributed to audience appreciation in later years. Lines such as &#145;Do you want to live forever?' should be changed to &#145;They can keep their cages for somebody else'.The soundtrack resonates the strength of the lead character. Its booming drums are the battle cry of the barbarian. A barbarian must make a loud entrance to be in character. The larger than life character now has a larger than life soundtrack and the movie explodes into life in front of the audience. The strong opening number is thus very effective as it sets the tone for the movie. Audience mood is initiated as value is added to the character as well.The special effects as delivered to today's audiences will result in these on show here being a detracting factor. Audiences are now inundated with high &#150; tech CGI and will immediately notice the artificial nature of the effects. Most of them looked very fake which will adversely affect the movie's longevity. It is difficult to immerse yourself into a story when you are jolted to reality with effects that literally stand out like a sore thumb.I will take one final look at the last of the detracting factors. It concerns the little matter of the wigs. Although this could fall under the previous paragraphs discussion, the wigs were so bad that they deserve special mention. Even in the 80's where big hair and even bigger wigs were the norm, these must have been noticeable. The wigs looked exactly like what they were &#150; wigs. Forget the sore thumb &#150; this one was a sore limb.Well told fantasy stories will always have an audience. Together with a strong cast the story will carry itself through to general acceptance. Members of the cast of special note were William Smith, Franco Columbo (a small appearance but the well known name draws attention) and Max Von Sydow. Powerful character players were well utilized here which complemented the aura of the age of the barbarian. It is this factor together with the story that will keep the movie available to future audiences, although the flame is starting to falter in the face of greater expectations for CGI. Production companies will invest heavily in CGI as this is what the current audience expects. There will, however, be fans of Arnold for many generations to come and it will be his star appeal that will be the key to this movie's endurance.This also means that the continuing story of &#145;Conan The Barbarian' will not be told for many years to come. There is no &#150; one today who can prise this role from Arnold. Any remake can only be attempted long after Arnold has left the movie arena. Others will only pale by comparison as movie fans have resoundingly chalked up another character for Arnold. If a remake is attempted, please do not raid the props cabinet where the old material may lay. Maybe they can digitally animate the wigs.

","genre":"Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"11 January 2004","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  There are few stars that can lay claim to a character as being solely their own. But Schwarzenegger can undeniably count sole proprietorship on two characters. The first, and undoubtedly the most famous, is the &#145;Terminator'. Who can ever begin to imagine any one else playing this role? Without him, the &#145;Terminator' franchise can only produce products based on the three movies. He is the franchise &#150; period. Then there is &#145;Conan'. If there ever were roles tailor made for an actor, these two were made for Schwarzenegger. Here was another story that could not continue without this star. The audience identified Arnold with the character. No &#150; one else would suffice.The obvious implication of the above statement is that Arnold was a huge contributor to the movies success. This together with the story &#150; albeit with some cheesiness &#150; and a powerful soundtrack helped to prevent the negative factors detracting from an entertaining movie. The detracting factors of note were the obligatory 80's cheesiness, weak special effects and hammed up acting. Oh, I almost forgot to mention the wigs. How can anyone ever forget those?The gargantuan presense of Arnold is all conquering from the moment we see him. He is perfect for the role. Besides fulfilling the physical appearance needs of the character with his obvious girth, he radiates the charisma of a leader. As in real life, the audience is in no doubt as to the fact that this is a man destined for greatness. His chiseled features and thick accent accentuate him as a mighty warrior with a deadly purpose. It also gives us the audience's visual pre &#150; conception of barbarians. The word barbarian conjures up an image of powerful warriors who ensured that their foes met with a bloody end. They were ruthless and justice was meted out with powerful swings of their oversized weapons. Their history has been more than glossed over with tales of fantasy and folklore. This is a fact that is also attributable to Arnold when we hear of stories of incredible feats in his bodybuilding days. The character thus demanded someone larger than life and Arnold fills the tag quite comfortably.The story tells of a man who when released from slavery, seeks revenge and embarks on a dangerous journey with many perils in the form of creatures of the night and fearless warriors. He befriends others as daring as himself and their combined talents draws the attention of the King whose daughter has been kidnapped by Conan's enemies. This is a classic version of the hero's journey where he rises from suppression against his enemies overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles and wreaks his revenge. This is a story that has mass appeal since most people feel suppressed by the system and would like to cause their own havoc in overcoming it. The resonance of the characters therefore has a real effect despite the fantasy aspect of the story.The mixture of characters is reminiscent of folklore, especially the barbarian's small sidekick. All knights and warriors have their dependable right hand man who is usually very much the second man. This is also evident in other media and I was particularly reminded of &#145;Slaine' from the 2000AD comic strip. It is this combination of characters that keeps the story moving forward with added interest. Each new character must add something different thus making a worthwhile contribution.

A massive, gigantic understatement! But it is also a display of film-genius.The movie is filmed in Black and White and is presented as a documentary of a serial killer. The film crew follows Benoit, the killer, around town as he recites poetry, muses on welfare and housing reform, ponders philosophy, and ... well, kills. Totally randomly.He explains to the film crew the lessons he has learned about killing, how to stay low key, who to go after, and what potential victims are a waste of time. For Benoit, killing is an art form, but not one that should be undertaken frivolously.There are scenes when his lunacy are briefly pierced by humanity - he counsels one of the film crew not to kill, because once you start it becomes a habit. In another scene he laments having killed a suburban family, because they had nothing good to steal, as it turned out. He proclaims that there should be a law against killing for no good reason.Those who shy from blood and killing - about the most graphical violence you'll ever see documented in a film - should shy from this movie. But anyone with an interest in a glimpse at the darkest side of human nature will appreciate this film, not necessarily for its story or its darkness, but for its ability to make us think, and open our eyes to human behaviour we don't like to admit might exist.During the course of the movie you become totally numb to the act of killing (or maming or torture or rape or any violent crime). It is no longer shocking when he kills yet another victim. It has become commonplace. You just sort of scratch your head and wonder - why this one? why now? why him? why her? This mental numbness is made possible by the way it is filmed - as though it were a documentary. Not long into the movie you begin to wonder if this is real, or just a movie. I wonder if this is the kind of numbness that soldiers experienced in wars like WWI, entrenched and under constant fire - to where the violence around become the norm. I read a book once called My War Gone By, I Miss it So (that's a whole 'nother review) in which a war-writer kept returning to the front because after experiencing violence all around him day after day after day, he could no longer live without it. In Man Bites Dog the killing is Benoit's addiction, but we, as viewers become complacent to it. We have been numbed to where it is no longer disturbing. Makes you scratch your head and wonder is such detachment from emotion and what's right really possible???To add to the realism, all the actors play characters with their real names. The killer's mother and grandparents in the movie - are really the actor's mother and grandparents in real life. During most of the filming they were not told it was about serial killing, just that they were in a movie with their son. So they just act normal around the son they love, only to find out in later scenes that the whole film is about killing. Imagine the look of shock on their faces to find this out - to them the story then is no longer acting but real they've just discovered their son\/grandson made a film about brutal killings and the shock shows in their faces.Is it real? Is it a movie? What defines the difference?When I told him about this movie, a friend mentioned that society,as a whole, is already numb to brutal killing and violence. He's right about that.

After seeing that Leo would, Caspar leaves along with his brutal henchman Eddie Dane (J.E. Freeman), and in a sense has threatened Leo by saying he's 'sick of the high hat'. Leo's advisor Tom Reagan (Gabriel Byrne) disagrees with Leo's decision, and knows he refused Caspar because he is dating the target's sister, Verna (Marcia Gay Harden). Things began to get messy as a war begins to take shape, and Tom is afraid Leo will not be able to hold up against Caspar anymore. More-so, the target Bernie Bernbaum (John Turturro) begins to meet more with Tom, causing him problems. The main factor in 'Miller's Crossing' is the superb writing. The dialogue is quite refreshing and flows extremely well, (also see 'The Man Who Wasn't There' for an example of this). The characters are individual, living, breathing human beings and most of them want different things. The dialogue comes alive the most in several scenes between Tom and Leo. The performances are also good too, most notably Finney as the like-able Leo, a kind man who doesn't realize what trouble he's starting for everyone. Also worth mentioning are Bryne as the somewhat cold Tom, a man who is extremely intelligent and knows what he's doing. The supporting cast puts in some refined work as well, Polito as the temperamental Caspar, Turturro as the slick Bernbaum, and a nicely done cameo by Steve Buscemi as Mink, one of Bernie's friends. The photography by frequent Coen collaborator is also very nicely done, with some very beautiful shots. The action scenes in the film are also great to watch and the music by also frequent collaborator Carter Burwell is a nice touch too. Joel Coen also did a good job directing, making the scenes work out dynamically and getting the viewer into the film all the while building up momentum and throwing some surprises to the audience. The style of the film also was a different approach for them, it came after the dark and suspenseful thriller 'Blood Simple' and the whacked out comedy 'Raising Arizona', and instead transferred to a more smooth looking feel.

Also worth mentioning are Bryne as the somewhat cold Tom, a man who is extremely intelligent and knows what he's doing. The supporting cast puts in some refined work as well, Polito as the temperamental Caspar, Turturro as the slick Bernbaum, and a nicely done cameo by Steve Buscemi as Mink, one of Bernie's friends. The photography by frequent Coen collaborator is also very nicely done, with some very beautiful shots. The action scenes in the film are also great to watch and the music by also frequent collaborator Carter Burwell is a nice touch too. Joel Coen also did a good job directing, making the scenes work out dynamically and getting the viewer into the film all the while building up momentum and throwing some surprises to the audience. The style of the film also was a different approach for them, it came after the dark and suspenseful thriller 'Blood Simple' and the whacked out comedy 'Raising Arizona', and instead transferred to a more smooth looking feel. 'Miller's Crossing' is definitely a must see for all fans of the Coen brothers, a nicely styled little masterpiece and a refreshing look at the mob of the 30's. 10\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"11 January 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Circa World War One a low ranking British officer somehow manages to unite the rival tribes of Arabia to drive the Turks out of their yet unmapped country.Whether you like the work of David Lean or not you cannot begrudge him his chapter in cinema history.

However, if you do, read on...Plot synopsis An MI6 agent and his secretary are murdered while in Jamaica working on an inquiry regarding massive interference with American rocket launches. 007 is sent to investigate. Along the way he crosses paths with several beautiful young women, a helpful CIA agent (played to perfection by Jack Lord), and a megalomaniacal villain.....OK, it's a James Bond movie, do you reeeeeeeeeeeeeally need a plot synopsis? Didn't think so. Now on to the good stuff...Even though this is the first James Bond film, it doesn't have a few of the things that have gone on to become Bond trademarks. There is no pre-title sequence, no gadgets, and no appearance by Q; although a character named Major Boothroyd (the official name of Desmond Llewelyn's character) does issue Bond his handgun, though played by a different actor. What this film DOES have though, more than any other 007 flick is the James Bond character portrayed the way Ian Fleming wrote him. Anyone familiar with the novels knows that James Bond wasn't particularly friendly, and was about as far away from the cute, cuddly Bond that Roger Moore gave us as you could get. In fact, the James Bond that Ian Fleming created was pretty much a cold, ruthless ba****d.Back in 1961 Harry Saltzman optioned the screen rights to Ian Fleming's James Bond novels. He then formed EON productions with Albert R. (Cubby) Broccoli and they began the task of bringing 007 to the silver screen. They then signed Sean Connery to play Bond and Terence Young to direct.

Hey, if you can watch Bond's intro in the casino and not smile the first time Connery utters the immortal line Bond, James Bond, you should never bother watching another 007 film.There are certain things that feel dated but should be forgiven due to the fact that the movie was filmed in 1962. This film should be viewed as what it is the introduction to James Bond and the series, a task that it pulls off superbly.The new version of the DVD includes a great 42 minute 'making-of' documentary.

To make is life harder, his wife leaves him, his lover announces she is pregnant, his protégé goes off the rails (or claims to) and his editor turns up with his transvestite lover looking for a book.I missed this at the cinema but had heard good things about it and the cast seemed to suggest a very good film.  The plot summary is a little more than a summary of the various little happenings within the film as that is as close to a narrative flow as I could do.  The plot here is not that good and is spread over characters who come and go like players in a sketch rather than people.  What the film actually does well is a look at the character of Grady and the learning experience that these various little events bring him to.While this is weakened by the lack of a strong, traditional plot it is not weakened to the point that it doesn't work - it would only have worked better with a better plot.  As it is, it still manages to be quite bitter sweet and interesting enough to keep watching.  I considered it a disadvantage that the sketch-like events were more comic than anything else when the central character had more of a touch of the tragic to him - these were not balanced very well and the comic took something away from the more tragic character, but it still worked reasonably well.Douglas gave one of his best performances here - he is sensitive and understated and he plays it without glamour the whole way.  The support cast are also all good, even if some of them have very little to really do in the grand scheme of things.  Downey Jnr is in fine comic form but his actual character is more of a mystery.  Maguire is a good actor but he plays his cards too close to his chest and the script isn't as interested in him as it suggests by the first half of the film, leading to the feeling that he has just been forgotten in the later stages.  Holmes is cute but very sidelined and it is very much Douglas' film in line with the character-over-plot focus of the film.Overall this is a rather more low-key film than the heavy cast list would suggest and it may prove a bit disappointing to some viewers as a result.

Although the story is nice and sometimes emotional, what I really like is the animation. It has the animators' dedication inside it, I can tell. The voice acting is superb, particularly from the likes of Kurt Russell, Jack Albertson and Mickey Rooney. The younger Tod and Copper are adorable to watch and are brilliantly animated and voiced, but the film is at a more oppressive side later on as they get older, and to good effect as well when they have to confront a large bear. The emotional scenes are well done indeed, enough to bring tears to anyone's eyes. Not the best movie in the world, but then again it doesn't need to be because it is still a good enjoyable animated family film. It's five years since I've seen it, but the magic and charm is still there, and I know I will be seeing it again someday. I don't know how or where, but I will see it again someday... Although the first half is a bit cutesy for some, I give it 9\/10. So that means it is still well worth watching. Overall, a very nice film which is regrettably underrated.

Alex has to take him on and try to stop the ship as it `races' out of control.As if Twister hadn't done it already, Speed 2 basically showed us that the potential that was shown by De Bont's debut was clearly misplaced and he has yet to show he was really anything other than in the right place at the right time when it came to Speed.  The smell of desperation is in the air from the very start when Reeves declined to star, although Bullock was more desperate and did it.  This caused Annie to repeatedly state that `relationships built on etc etc never work out', all in an effort to explain it away and help the audience move on.  That the film is constantly harking back to a much better film is a big problem, it would almost have been smarter just to move totally away than to retread.The plot is plain silly and never gets close to being involving.  To demonstrate this, I never once gave a rats' ass what was happening - people got crushed by the boat and mangled in it's propellers (unseen) but the film (or me) never care and never lingers.  Likewise the supposed big climax is unengaging and smacks of desperation - bang for buck and all that.  The whole set up never really feels immediate or threatening, even when the boat swings out of control it is difficult to feel terrified as the boat slooooowly goes towards the tanker, worst come to worst people can jump off to safety.  The cruiser setting also is daft when seen beside the bus concept - the vast majority of the audience will ride a bus quite often, very few of us can relate to an ocean liner!  The speed is a problem and it is almost laughable it works so poorly!The cast is another problem.  Bullock tries to repeat her sparky performance from the first film - when she manages it, it only feels like an impression, when she doesn't manage it she is cast as a shrieking beauty needing saving. However she also struggles from a lack of chemistry with Patric.  It is a shame as he is an OK actor but not used to a pure action role and not used to not having material to work with.  He lacks charisma and is quite unconvincing.  Dafoe is awful; he drags the film down as much as anyone. His villain is a joke and never threatens in the way that Hopper's did (who managed to be funny and scary).  It is a bad impression all round.  The support cast of `innocents in peril' do much the same as the ones on the bus did, but we care less about them - they are well off and are separated from the action; those on the bus were in the thick of it and `normal' people who we could relate to.Overall this is as good a reason for not making unplanned sequels as any - there should be a board to approve all sequels to prevent cashing in!  The memory of the original is cheapen by this nasty film that is uninspiring and unthrilling at best, dull and stupid at worst.  De Bont never gets up a decent head of steam and he shows his inability to inject drama out of his own skill - anyone can point a camera, not everyone can (or should) direct.

Although a definite improvement over Patriot Games, and on par with The Hunt for Red October, the film contains serious points of lag.  The material in these drawn out sequences is interesting, but it molds the film into an average entry in either of two categories either as a tepid action film, or an underdeveloped drama.  Holes aside, the film is engaging enough to wet the appetites of fans of either genre, and is an entertaining experience overall.     Ford is the best Jack Ryan in my opinion, successfully conveying Ryan's intelligence as well as his vulnerability in dangerous situations.  Plus he is able to inject his trademark charm and snide humor into the role which gives the character a more down-to-earth character we can relate to.  Part of the problem with the movie is the lack of development of the rest of the characters.  Since the script is burdened with an array of important roles, their screen time is often marginalized.  For example, Willem Dafoe is given hardly any development prior to the climax of the film.  I respect Dafoe as an actor greatly, and found myself wishing that he would be involved in more of the film.  Anne Archer has the throwaway role as the wife of Jack Ryan, but James Earl Jones is able to shine as Admiral Greer, even though he's on the sidelines.  Some characters just don't fit, like the entire cabinet of political bigwigs who orchestrate the events of the movie.  Donald Moffat is ridiculous and an utter buffoon of a president, and Henry Czerny seems to be insidious for no reason.  Many of these holes in characters could have been remedied with another half hour of screen time.     However, my last comment would have shifted the context of the movie to a full blown drama.  As much as Clancy's work is engaging, the movie cannot stand on its own without the promise of action.  The action scenes are well done and gripping at times, but they are merely peppered throughout the film.  Philip Noyce is able to create scenes of tension without using weapons, such as the well-done scene involving a computer battle between Ford and Czerny.  Overall, the film gives off an odor stemming from a lack of sustained tension, and the plot visibly loses steam at points.     Ultimately, the main problem with Clear and Present Danger is the problem of defining what it clearly is as a movie.
