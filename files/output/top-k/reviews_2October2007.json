[{"date":"2 October 2007","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" In this day and age of teen comedies that rely upon sex-driven plots and crude toilet humour, Election is like a breath of fresh air. This is an intelligent, witty and scathing assault on high school presidential elections. Its got a wonderful cast. Superb direction by Alexander Payne. And a very clever, masterful screenplay to work from. This is how teen movies should be made.Not since the days of John Hughes have I seen a teen film so astute. Election is a film that is scarily realistic about the inner workings of the high school caste system. And Payne has an imaginatively assembled cast to carry the film off with aplomb.One of the most inspired touches to Election is the fact that Ferris Bueller himself, Matthew Broderick plays the part of a teacher. It seems that Ferris has gone from skiving off school to teaching at one! Broderick plays Jim McAllister, a popular civics teacher at Carver High. He seems an affable chap who gets along great with the students. Well, except for one.There is one student in Jim's class who really gets under his skin. And she's a nightmare from the moment you set eyes on her! Tracy Flick, the next in line to be class president. And she's brought brilliantly to life by Reese Witherspoon.Tracy is one of these ambitious, eager overachievers. People who are so full of the greatest intentions. And a bit full of themselves at the same time! She's bright, perky and very assured. She's also pushy, manipulative and a monumental pain in the arse!Jim can't stand her. And for more than one reason. Jim's best friend, Dave Novotny (Mark Harelik) used to be a teacher at Carver High. But he made the rather questionable decision of initiating a quiet relationship with Tracy. She returned his advances, but then turned him in to the school board.Tracy got off scot-free, and Dave's reputation was destroyed. He never taught in a high school again. Jim knows that Tracy is not the picture of innocence she makes herself out to be. And when she enters the student presidential election unopposed, Jim doesn't want her to win. Not only because of what she did to Dave, but if she wins, it means Jim will have to spend more time with her. And if he does, he may wind up sharing Dave's fate. Doesn't say much for his willpower does it?!So Jim sets a plan in motion. Paul Meztler (Chris Klein) was a former high school jock. Captain of the high school football team, he was big man on campus until a skiing accident ruined his leg, and put an end to any more footballing. Jim convinces Paul to enter the running and play on a sympathy vote from the students, which will throw a spanner in the works for Tracy's campaign.But there are unforeseen complications. Paul's lesbian sister enters the election too out of sheer spite, when her bisexual girlfriend left her for Paul! This only serves to make Tracy even more determined to win, leading her ambitions to become more and more crazed. And Jim's carefully calculated plan slowly begins to unravel.I can't begin to tell you what a pleasure it was to sit through Election. Everything about the film feels so right. Not only the writing and the sharply acute dialogue, but every actor suits their character right down to a tee.Reese Witherspoon has always been an intelligent performer to me. And she has seldom been better in anything else. She may have won an Academy Award for Walk the Line, but her performance as Tracy Flick is just as Oscar worthy.Witherspoon doesn't so much play the part. She embodies it. She walks around the set with a dominant personality hidden behind a faintly aggressive pleasant demeanour. One of these insufferable teenagers who firmly believe that what's best for them is best for everyone. Tracy speaks in upper case. Her gaze is never short of penetrating. She has an endless supply of put downs, insults and veiled threats. And Witherspoon pulls it all together with style and grace. Its a criminally overlooked performance on her resume.Matthew Broderick is equally impressive. It seems that with Election, Ferris Bueller has finally grown up. And although he plays Jim as a decent guy, he has his flaws. He must have a bit of a petty streak otherwise he wouldn't want to scupper a straight A student's ambitions to be class president. And he cheats on his wife too. You can certainly sympathise with Jim at times. But he's not always likable.Alexander Payne has directed a really outstanding teen film. The way it highlights the evils and backstabbing that forms the sinister underbelly of the US public school system is right on target. His films are always true to life. Something he would recapture in his following film, the superb About Schmidt.And the ending is terrific. Its not at all what you are expecting. There are no clichéd moralistic speeches. No good triumphing over evil. No we see some ugly sides to human natures in this film. And there's no cop-out ending either. There's that all too important residue of realism to Tracy and Jim's fates and futures.A superior teen film of the genre. And I really like the film's moral. Pray to God you never have to teach somebody like Tracy Flick!

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"2 October 2007","score":"6 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Black comedy can be a difficult genre to get right, in the cinema as well as in the theatre. We can, I am sure, all think of films which were intended to be gross but hilarious and ended up as simply gross. There are too many examples to list them all, but high on my personal list of offenders in this regard must be The Sweetest Thing, Beautiful Creatures and Drop Dead Gorgeous. On the other hand, when black comedy succeeds, the result can be superb. Two of my favourites are Kubrick's Dr Strangelove and Scorsese's King of Comedy, both of which derive humour from serious subjects (nuclear war and crime) but do so with a brilliant satirical wit.John Waters's Serial Mom is not quite in the same class as those two films, but is one of the better black comedies of recent years. The main character is Beverley Sutphin, a middle-aged, middle-class Middle American housewife. Beverley, happily married to dentist Eugene with two teenage children, Chip and Misty, lives in an affluent, idyllic suburb which looks as though it has been taken from a fifties sit-com. (Like most of Waters's films, this one is set in his home town of Baltimore). There is only one thing which disturbs the peace and tranquillity of the area. Beverley combines her role as a housewife and mother with a part-time career as a serial killer. Her first victim is Paul Stubbins, a teacher who makes some unkind remarks about her son at a PTA meeting, and she progresses to her daughter's unfaithful boyfriend, a couple who are rude about Eugene's dental practice and various people who commit minor social gaffes such as failing to rewind rented video tapes (the film predates the coming of DVD), failing to recycle their garbage, and wearing white shoes after Labor day. (This last is, apparently, regarded as a major fashion crime in America). Eventually she is arrested and put on trial.Waters has the reputation of being a director to whom the notion of good taste is quite alien, and, with a plot like this, Serial Mom could have ended up as nothing more than horribly tasteless garbage. It is, of course, horribly tasteless and not a film to see if you are at all squeamish- Waters does not spare us sight of plenty of blood and gore- but is saved from ending up as garbage by two things. The first is an often very witty script, displaying a refreshingly cynical sense of humour, which includes some great lines such as He killed people, mom- We all have our bad days. and Jesus said nothing to condemn capital punishment as he hung on the cross, did he? (the local priest is preaching a pro-death penalty sermon).The second is Kathleen Turner's manically over-the-top performance as Beverley, alternating between a model of bourgeois domestic virtue and a bloodthirsty maniac, and playing both with equal relish. My favourite parts were the courtroom scene where Beverley conducts her own defence with great brilliance and the scenes where she makes obscene phone calls to her neighbour Dottie, a woman who can be shocked by a phrase as seemingly innocuous as Are those pussy willows? Turner is an actress who has somewhat disappeared from view in recent years, but in the eighties and nineties she was one of Hollywood's best known leading ladies and gave some excellent performances in films like the neo-noir thriller Body Heat and The War of the Roses, another very good black comedy.Like most good black comedies, Serial Mom has some serious points to make. The mores of suburbia have been fair game for satirists ever since the first suburbs were built, and here Waters is sending up the culture of middle-class conformity which all too often attaches to such places. Beverley is far from being the only all-American soccer mom who looks with horrified disfavour on her neighbours' minor deviations from accepted norms; all that distinguishes her from millions of others is the extreme lengths to which she will go to punish such deviations. The satire, however, is not just aimed at Beverley, but also at her victims, some of whom are such obnoxious individuals that it is impossible to have any sympathy for them, despite their horrific fates. There is one grotesque scene where Emma Lou Jensen (she who fails to rewind her videos) sings loudly and tunelessly along to Tomorrow from the musical Annie while allowing her dog to lick her feet all over suggesting she is, to say the least, a somewhat strange person. Stubbins, who suggests that Chip is in need of therapy because of his love of horror films, is the sort of arrogant, self-important teacher who thinks that he is paid not just to teach maths but also to control every aspect of his students' lives, down to their taste in films.Serial Mom may not be the best cinematic satire on suburbia of recent years (that must be Sam Mendes's American Beauty), but it is, for all its lapses of taste, a witty and entertaining black comedy. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"2 October 2007","score":"6 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" Black comedy can be a difficult genre to get right, in the cinema as well as in the theatre.

Many years later, after a nasty break-up, he finds another one, but doesn't realize what she is because -- magically -- she can have legs when on dry land. Can love cross the boundaries of the sea and what about the scientists who want to dissect her and trap her in a tuna net?I'm not a big Tom Hanks fan, Eugene Levy is a dork and John Candy is just not particularly funny, in my opinion. Granted, Candy has had a few good roles (Uncle Buck, Home Alone) but overall is just a loud-mouthed nuisance. Levy has only become a bigger star over time, which is really too bad... he was fine here. Hanks, well, I liked The Terminal and a few others, but he is very hit and miss for me (which may be his choice of romantic comedies).Daryl Hannah played the role of the mermaid Madison. I have to get this off my chest if, as is claimed, girls today are named Madison because of this film, this film owes the world an apology. But second, why Daryl Hannah? She's somewhat manlike, and they have her (a vegetarian) eating lobster? And how does your hair stay crimped underwater? I don't have a better casting suggestion, but I didn't find her convincing as a strong love interest. The silent acting was done alright, however.Here's the spoiler part at the end, Bauer has the choice to join Madison in the sea or to stay on land without her. The catch is that under the sea, he must be by her at all times or he will drown, and he can never return to land. He chooses the sea. I'm sorry, but he proposes to a girl after about four days of knowing her and then gives up his friends and family and a well-paying job to go to the ocean? Where he has to pee and poop in front of a mermaid all the time, and he cannot talk? I have friends I love and have had some close relationships with girls, but together forever, always and everywhere? I don't know.I never saw Mermaids but I have seen The Little Mermaid multiple times. I like that one far better than this. Good songs, good epic story (with the same amount of romance) and a far more beautiful mermaid. Ariel can kick Madison's butt any day of the week. But if you like Tom Hanks and early 1980s films... this one was enjoyable.

Many years later, after a nasty break-up, he finds another one, but doesn't realize what she is because -- magically -- she can have legs when on dry land. Can love cross the boundaries of the sea and what about the scientists who want to dissect her and trap her in a tuna net?I'm not a big Tom Hanks fan, Eugene Levy is a dork and John Candy is just not particularly funny, in my opinion. Granted, Candy has had a few good roles (Uncle Buck, Home Alone) but overall is just a loud-mouthed nuisance. Levy has only become a bigger star over time, which is really too bad... he was fine here. Hanks, well, I liked The Terminal and a few others, but he is very hit and miss for me (which may be his choice of romantic comedies).Daryl Hannah played the role of the mermaid Madison. I have to get this off my chest if, as is claimed, girls today are named Madison because of this film, this film owes the world an apology. But second, why Daryl Hannah? She's somewhat manlike, and they have her (a vegetarian) eating lobster? And how does your hair stay crimped underwater? I don't have a better casting suggestion, but I didn't find her convincing as a strong love interest. The silent acting was done alright, however.Here's the spoiler part at the end, Bauer has the choice to join Madison in the sea or to stay on land without her. The catch is that under the sea, he must be by her at all times or he will drown, and he can never return to land. He chooses the sea. I'm sorry, but he proposes to a girl after about four days of knowing her and then gives up his friends and family and a well-paying job to go to the ocean? Where he has to pee and poop in front of a mermaid all the time, and he cannot talk? I have friends I love and have had some close relationships with girls, but together forever, always and everywhere? I don't know.I never saw Mermaids but I have seen The Little Mermaid multiple times. I like that one far better than this. Good songs, good epic story (with the same amount of romance) and a far more beautiful mermaid. Ariel can kick Madison's butt any day of the week.

Basically Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) is a student writing a paper about urban legends in Chicago, and the one she is most interested in is the Candyman (Tony Todd), a black ex-slave turned artist, real name Daniel Robitaille, who was punished in his time by villagers, after getting a white girl pregnant. They sawed off his right hand (and covered with honey, the sequel apparently details this as where he got his nickname), and he was stung to death by bees, and apparently he comes back to life wielding a large bloody hook where his hand was. The legend says that Candyman will appear if you say his name five times in a mirror, and he will kill them with his weapon, so Helen and her friend Bernadette 'Bernie' Walsh (Kasi Lemmons) are investigating mysterious, unsolved murders happening in Cabrini Green, that may or may not have been caused by this legendary killer. Interviewing people who have heard the legend, and witnesses or those around at the time of murders, particularly of a woman in an abandoned apartment, most say that Candyman is responsible, but Helen doesn't believe the legend. This is until she meets Candyman, he believes that Helen is his true love, and some time later after waking up from this meeting she is covered in blood, a dog was killed and the black woman's baby is missing, so she is charged with this crime. Her husband Trevor (Terminator 2's Xander Berkeley) and many others are questioning her innocence and beliefs, and Candyman is getting away with more and more murders, as he is invisible to others, until of course she says his name five times in the mirror and they are his victim. In the end, Helen gets caught in a bonfire with the baby Candyman kidnapped, but she managed to get away from the fire, and trap him inside, but she still died from her severe burns. After the funeral her husband Trevor is so distraught and he accidentally says her name in the mirror five times, he unintentionally summons her, as she has become like the Candyman, and kills him. Also starring Vanessa Williams as Anne-Marie McCoy, DeJuan Guy as Jake, Marianna Elliott as Clara, Ted Raimi (Sam's brother) as Billy, Ria Pavia as Monica and Mark Daniels as Student. Todd gives a suitably dark and cold-faced performance as the hook-handed killer, and Madsen is alright as the lead female victim, the bloody effects are great, including the disturbing sight of bees from Candyman's mouth and stomach, it is one of those cult favourites and certainly a horror film to see.

But Under Capricorn is remembered best as Ingrid Bergman's last Hollywood production because while this was playing in theaters, news of her out of wedlock pregnancy as a result of her affair with Italian director Roberto Rossellini was announced. Hollywood quickly condemned Saint Ingrid as if somehow because she played Joan of Arc and a nun, she was held to some kind of higher moral standard.Under Capricorn is best described as Australian Gothic, it's very similar to Rebecca with a touch of O'Neill's Mourning Becomes Electra and a bit of Wuthering Heights tossed in for effect. The setting is Australia in 1831 where new British King William IV has appointed a new governor, Cecil Parker, for New South Wales. And Parker has a cousin, Michael Wilding, who has accompanied him. Wilding's an independent sort who when told not to associate with rich, but brooding landowner Joseph Cotten, does just the opposite. He remembers why he seems to know Cotten and his wife Ingrid Bergman. Back in Ireland, there was quite a bit of scandal when Bergman of the landed gentry and Cotten a groom on her estate eloped. Her brother came after them and Cotten was put on trial and found guilty of his murder. As it was a manslaughter rap, Cotten got the choice of going to Australia or a prison stretch. Cotten went to Australia and became pretty rich. Ingrid followed, but the happiness they sought eluded them. They're now a pair of miserable people who are shunned by polite society.Like Rebecca, Under Capricorn has a housekeeper from hell in Margaret Leighton who may have gone back from Australia and become Mrs. Danvers great grandmother. Leighton has her eyes on Cotten and she's slowly poisoning Bergman. Leighton has turned the whole manor staff against Bergman when Wilding arrives on the scene.Joseph Cotten is a bit more rough around the edges than we normally see him on film. Still he does deliver a nice performance whose sacrifice for love we eventually learn.Though there are a lot of similarities to Rebecca, Under Capricorn is not nearly as well done.

It never did - not for me, at least. 2\/10 ","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance"},{"date":"2 October 2007","score":"","review":" By the time I watched this film, I was aware of Jack Black's role in it, and was also familiar the songs, Defy You by The Offspring and The One by Foo Fighters, two songs included in the soundtrack.

Still determined, he struggles to get in, only to experience one mishap after another, sometimes caused by members of his embarrassing family (an alcoholic mother, a stoner brother, and a severely senile stepfather)! Orange County is a raunchy, silly, and often tasteless comedy, a kind of film which often comes from Hollywood nowadays, but also a kind which many detest. However, if this type of comedy usually appeals to you, then you could find that there are a good number of laughs to be had in this film, even if most of them are not that memorable. Jack Black as Lance Brumder is a big part of the humour in the film, doing some insane things, like accidentally setting a university building on fire, though he's certainly not responsible for ALL the laughs.

At points when characters speak of him off-screen, speaking of things that we are surprised to hear about him, that take us aback and color his image, Pacino has prepared the size for those turning points to fit in. His improvised scenes are exceptional as well, and are in fact some of the most riveting, nail-bitingly intense scenes in the entire film. In such scenes, he is matched by the great actor Charles Durning and Chris Sarandon's becoming fulfillment of his role.Indeed, this is by far Durning's most riveting performance. He works so well here because in shouting matches with Sonny, he looks and sounds entirely his age, not a movie character. He's fat, middle-aged, tired, just as surprised as everybody else. He runs short of breath, trying desperately to keep up with the pressure cooking higher all around him. As Det. Sgt.

One of this stunning succession of brilliant scenes is the first time Sonny emerges to talk face-to-face with Moretti in the street, which begins with a protracted pin-drop silence and slowly, steadily, invisibly culminates in deafening, ear-splitting chaos.Lumet opens the film with a montage of city scenes in NYC with a good getting-up-in-the- morning song like Elton John's Amoreena and with the same indifference ends up on Sonny, Sal and their friend waiting outside a bank in a car, an image that just happens to continue. This is a great way to demonstrate the it-could-happen-anywhereness. Lumet's overall direction of the film is beautiful, indicative once again of the masterful mainstay of cinema in the 1970s.

I liked it, but when the movie came out in 1992 I failed to see it at the time. This despite the fact that it's ensemble cast was considered as having done a great job in the film version by most of the film critics. Yet, despite this fanfare, except for nominating Al Pacino for best actor (for the role of hotshot salesman Ricky Roma), the Academy Awards did not note the film at all, and Pacino lost that year.But GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS really does not require Oscar recognition to remain among the top ten ensemble casts movie jobs in American film. It also is an intriguing look at the world of salesmen at it's most intense. The salesmen here are real estate salesmen (Glengarry Glen Ross are two valuable pieces of real estate the firm is planning to start selling soon - and a set of valuable customer leads on these properties are at the center of the story). Besides Levine and Roma, the other salesmen in the firm are Moss (Ed Harris) and Aaronov (Alan Arkin). This particular office of the multi-state realty firm is run by Williamson (Kevin Spacey). Part of the wildness of the film is that Williamson's style is not tolerant of the boy's club boasting and tricks of the sales force - tricks, by the way, that are not working as well as they used to.Sales are generally down, and the firm's partners send legendary super-salesman Blake (Alec Baldwin) to give a talk to the salesman. Blake is not standing for the old war stories of these blow hearts. He tells them how low they are all viewed by the top management, and is giving them a contest which is really an ultimatum In one week whoever makes the most sales will be given a Eldorado as first prize. Second prize is a set of cheap steak knives. Everyone else outside of those two places will lose their jobs as failures.The salesmen are hard working, but there have been problems with properties they have to unload, as well as the fact that the leads dished out are hardly first rate. But if they were top notch salesmen they would be able to sell these properties - and they all claim that they are.Best is Roma - the hotshot salesman, who we see managing to download worthless, overpriced land on one Lingk (Jonathan Pryce) over drinks in a Chinese restaurant. He seems most assured of coming in first place. Levine is a once good salesman of some years earlier, but of late things keep falling between his fingers. Aaronov is an honest plodder, a tortoise to Roma's hare, but he has been turning in very few sales himself. As for Moss, he strikes the viewer as a constant complainer, and one gets the impression he really is not very good at his job.Roma is certain the Lingk sale will put him into the top slot. Then Levine comes in having made an $82,000.00 sale to an elderly couple (the huge amount is that it would be for 8 apartment units - like a small apartment house). They are wildly congratulating each other, when they learn the offices of Williamson were burgled during the night, and that some of the Glengarry leads were stolen. This jeopardizes both sales because of the police investigation going on.The film strips the entire cast of pretenses. Baldwin's part is relatively short (just one massive scene at the start - written for him for the film not the play). He is crude, vulgar, but direct. He does not care about events from fifteen years back that they might talk of - it's today that counts. His putting Moss into his place by pointing out his watch is worth more than Moss' current automobile is proof that however nasty his speech is it happens to be true. It was a wonderful cameo role for Baldwin.Lemmon's Levine is like Willy Loman, only a little younger. He knows how to lie and cheat customers with the best, but he has had problems with his daughter that have preoccupied him of late. But that is the same type of sentiment that Loman found is not part of the business ethic. Pacino's Roma is Lemmon's admirer, and they have the closest thing to a real friendship in that office. In fact, when Pacino is having problems with Pryce (having second thoughts on the sale after a talk with his wife), Lemmon actually tries to help Pacino out in a complicated lie. Harris' Moss is a slimy type - he tries to get Arkin into a scheme to steal the Glengarry leads from Spacey's office, even suggesting that Arkin is an accomplice after the fact no matter whether he'll do it or not. Arkin is a nervous type - a plodder - but both basically honest and also aware of his small caliber personality that can't gain respect from anyone (his one tirade is confronted by an increasingly annoyed Spacey who basically orders him to go out and have lunch!). As for Spacey, he is aware that his powers are only meted out from above, and he does what is ethical to the clients in an unethical business (we never hear what Baldwin tells him about his office management). But his openness with customers ends up screwing things for at least one salesman, and the whole pack feel he's a waste. Actually he turns out to be the smartest in the office.Despite Mamet's joyous use of foul language, GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS remains a marvelous ensemble work for stage and film, and a remarkably honest view of what really matters, in the end, in American business.

Part of the wildness of the film is that Williamson's style is not tolerant of the boy's club boasting and tricks of the sales force - tricks, by the way, that are not working as well as they used to.Sales are generally down, and the firm's partners send legendary super-salesman Blake (Alec Baldwin) to give a talk to the salesman. Blake is not standing for the old war stories of these blow hearts. He tells them how low they are all viewed by the top management, and is giving them a contest which is really an ultimatum In one week whoever makes the most sales will be given a Eldorado as first prize. Second prize is a set of cheap steak knives. Everyone else outside of those two places will lose their jobs as failures.The salesmen are hard working, but there have been problems with properties they have to unload, as well as the fact that the leads dished out are hardly first rate. But if they were top notch salesmen they would be able to sell these properties - and they all claim that they are.Best is Roma - the hotshot salesman, who we see managing to download worthless, overpriced land on one Lingk (Jonathan Pryce) over drinks in a Chinese restaurant. He seems most assured of coming in first place. Levine is a once good salesman of some years earlier, but of late things keep falling between his fingers. Aaronov is an honest plodder, a tortoise to Roma's hare, but he has been turning in very few sales himself. As for Moss, he strikes the viewer as a constant complainer, and one gets the impression he really is not very good at his job.Roma is certain the Lingk sale will put him into the top slot. Then Levine comes in having made an $82,000.00 sale to an elderly couple (the huge amount is that it would be for 8 apartment units - like a small apartment house). They are wildly congratulating each other, when they learn the offices of Williamson were burgled during the night, and that some of the Glengarry leads were stolen. This jeopardizes both sales because of the police investigation going on.The film strips the entire cast of pretenses. Baldwin's part is relatively short (just one massive scene at the start - written for him for the film not the play). He is crude, vulgar, but direct. He does not care about events from fifteen years back that they might talk of - it's today that counts. His putting Moss into his place by pointing out his watch is worth more than Moss' current automobile is proof that however nasty his speech is it happens to be true. It was a wonderful cameo role for Baldwin.Lemmon's Levine is like Willy Loman, only a little younger. He knows how to lie and cheat customers with the best, but he has had problems with his daughter that have preoccupied him of late. But that is the same type of sentiment that Loman found is not part of the business ethic. Pacino's Roma is Lemmon's admirer, and they have the closest thing to a real friendship in that office. In fact, when Pacino is having problems with Pryce (having second thoughts on the sale after a talk with his wife), Lemmon actually tries to help Pacino out in a complicated lie. Harris' Moss is a slimy type - he tries to get Arkin into a scheme to steal the Glengarry leads from Spacey's office, even suggesting that Arkin is an accomplice after the fact no matter whether he'll do it or not. Arkin is a nervous type - a plodder - but both basically honest and also aware of his small caliber personality that can't gain respect from anyone (his one tirade is confronted by an increasingly annoyed Spacey who basically orders him to go out and have lunch!). As for Spacey, he is aware that his powers are only meted out from above, and he does what is ethical to the clients in an unethical business (we never hear what Baldwin tells him about his office management). But his openness with customers ends up screwing things for at least one salesman, and the whole pack feel he's a waste. Actually he turns out to be the smartest in the office.Despite Mamet's joyous use of foul language, GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS remains a marvelous ensemble work for stage and film, and a remarkably honest view of what really matters, in the end, in American business.

I liked it, but when the movie came out in 1992 I failed to see it at the time. This despite the fact that it's ensemble cast was considered as having done a great job in the film version by most of the film critics. Yet, despite this fanfare, except for nominating Al Pacino for best actor (for the role of hotshot salesman Ricky Roma), the Academy Awards did not note the film at all, and Pacino lost that year.But GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS really does not require Oscar recognition to remain among the top ten ensemble casts movie jobs in American film.

Who could forget Carl Weathers' failed attempt to become a leading male action movie star with the dreadful Action Jackson? Or the talking computer and the romantic nerd who made an incredibly annoying song very popular for about a year? Or good ol' Kev Bacon strutting around a barn to a cheesy 80's pop tune... And let's not forget the horror and bad post-star wars science fiction...but that's another review. Onto the delicious slice of cheesecake at hand that is Soul Man.Very white-white guy Mark Watson (C Thomas Howell) has just got into Harvard Law with his best bud (Arye Gross), but there's a spanner in the works. His newly enlightened Dad (the very funny James B Sikking) has decided to let Mark grow up a little by paying his own way. Unable to come up with the 50k Mark scams a scholarship meant for an African American student by taking an overdose of tanning pills and Michael Jackson-ing his hair. He gets in, and his education begins as he learns what it's like to be black on a mostly-white campus, and falls in love with a black girl (Rae Dawn Chong) to boot.It's typical 80's rom-com formula all the way, boy-meets-girl, boy loses girl while learning life lessons, boy-gets-girl in the end kind of thing. There's even a woefully cheesy romantic montage scene to the tunes of Suddenly it's Magic...pure gold! This one stands out from the pack because a) it has some genuinely gut-busting moments, and b) it has great performances from all the leads. C Thomas Howell is achingly hilarious in some scenes as the white-guy-trying-to-act-like a black guy. His facial expressions during the basketball game scene are gold. Rae Dawn Chong is always good, she's a great straight-guy to Howell's over-the-top Mark Watson. Arye Gross is great, it's easy to see why he went on to other (better) things, he's got some great comic timing and provides some of the movie's best moments. And James Earl Jones, although a little bit i did this for the money, is imposing and dead-pan funny at the same time.It's not without it's flaws. The Kareem thing was a tad distasteful and required just a little too much suspension of disbelief. The black panther get-up at the BSLA meeting was just ridiculous, for one scene Watson seemingly becomes a total moron, then reverts back to being a normal guy. And the over the top punch out scene at the end where the two racist jokers go flying over cafeteria tables, that was just silly. But to compensate, there's some incredibly funny moments and just a good all round feel to this movie that will ensure it gets another play in my house soon.So, to sum up, Soul Man elicits more laughs than groans, so it's a winner in my books.

I love to see a great piece in the big screen, one of those who give us some reflection of life, some outstanding lines, epic portrayals of great men of our history and everything. But I also LOVE to strike a great laugh as well! And this movie delivers!! You just blow your head off of laughing, from the very beginning 'till the very end! The jokes are some of the best of all times!! Every single frame of this movie is a turbulence of nonstop laughing!! I just can't find words to say something bad about this movie, I mean it.How can one not give a single good laugh after seeing Blackbeard (Peter Unistov) put Steve Walker (Dean Jones) into trouble with a police officer? Or even, in the olympics where Blackbeard helps poor Godolphin team to win, specially when he messes up with the final competition, where he confuses every other runner simply using a hot-dog, a flag and a bottle of rum! THIS FOLKS, IS HOW EVERY COMEDY MOVIE SHOULD BE MADE!! I mean it! This is first class comedy! I first saw this movie when I had 8 years. I'm 26 now. And I continue to love this as much as I loved when I was a boy.This is, without a doubt a 10 out of 10! And even giving this a 10 is not enough, because it deserves much more! Perhaps, shouting the magic words (kree kru vergo gebba kalto kree) out loud can make some other picture like that appears around.

This movie is intended to be a romantic comedy, but doesn't convince me because it fails.Yes, it has some humor and some funny moments (especially by Rupert Everett's character, George). However, the rest of this movie's humor ends up being ridiculous and somehow annoying. Besides, this movie isn't sweet or truly romantic for a love story.Also, the character played by Julia Roberts (Julianne or simply Jules) is pure evil, rude, jealous, selfish and greedy. Her intentions are dark. What she does is really mean she tries to steal her best friend's bride to get him back, but she (Jules) never let him love her when he loved her.Some catchy songs can be listened in this movie, especially I Say a Little Prayer. The marriage at the end is beautifully made and the final scene is comical. Rupert Everett is hilarious in this movie and I like very much Cameron Diaz's character (Kimmy Wallace) in this movie. She's enchanting, adorable, sweet and beautiful the opposite of Jules.Overall, this is a bitter and crude movie. Not a keeper or a movie to watch over and over.

Oh my, the tensions mount.The Wayans brothers make bad movies. They're not particularly funny or well put together.

And then we get Jason Alexander thrown in here and just confusing me more. Was he funny or just a poor cardboard cut-out of a sensational journalist? I'm not sure.What really gets me is how Blankman talks like a mentally retarded person. If he were more normal with better speech and nicer clothes, I would have liked the movie slightly more. I understand the bad clothes were the joke, but it just really wasn't funny for me. It seems more like a way for the studio to save money on the wardrobe than a decent plot device -- if he can invent a bullet-proof liquid, why can't he match his shirt to his pants?

Don't take it personally, but there's so bad it's good and so bad it's bad and this clearly falls into the latter category.

Filled with superb acting, direction, dialogue and absolutely timeless photography; Clockwork Orange is a true masterpiece, often defining at every moment exactly why we watch movies.Throughout we are treated a whole ensemble of fantastic and sometimes zany performances from the whole cast, with special mention to McDowell in the lead role as the ever deranged and sadistic Alex DeLarge. This is perhaps my favourite feature of the movie and is indeed an absolute treat from beginning to end to watch McDowell go through nearly every emotion imaginable with uttermost believability and conviction. Not only this but there are some characters I will never forget because of the their seemingly surreal and disorientated nature that defies all reality or even normality, if there is even such a thing in Kubrick's directorial palette. This is quite a bit to do with their actual dialogue actually, often showcasing very proper and old English grammar, which contrasts the very nature of the scenes it is being used in to grand effect.This is also why I often found myself chuckling during quite a few scenes in the film. Whether it was seeing DeLarge bending over to have his anus inspected or the over-the-top nature of the officer in charge of his cell-block (whom often reminded me of John Cleese of Monty Python fame of all things), I loved the odd breaks in drama for a bit of tongue in cheek, dark witty humour often left out of such films.This however is probably not why A Clockwork Orange is hailed as the classic it is today. Instead it is the completely believable and realistic portrayal of torture and violence born in a very bleak and not so distant dystopian society. The whole affair is brought to life accordingly and very successfully through the main characters and their distinctive obsessions of mindless violence and rape. It is these themes and many others present during the film that makes it one of the most thought provoking and emotionally startling films ever made to date. With his previous film Kubrick sought to provoke the mind, but with Clockwork, he goes mainly for the heart and strikes emotions that are very rarely or only mildly touched on by any other movies.Another couple of things before I wrap this up the camera work and photography are again beautiful and Kubrick's unique vision comes across vividly in the film, creating a world not easily forgettable. Furthermore -and another trademark of his- is the perfect use of classical music where it is needed, creating a brilliant soundtrack instantly recognisable from all others.So there you have it, just a few reasons why this movie will more than likely having you gripped, with your eyes unable to move away from the screen, whether you like it or not.
