A true classic action film from the 80'! After 20.years watching again this movie it is still a classic sci-fi action film. Kurt Russell rocks also there is theme music from Escape From New York (1981) my favorite classic film that Kurt Russell and John Carpenter worked on it together.Clever one liners that will keep you rolling. This movie has it all, high kicks, low kicks, laughs, ghouls, demons, girls, and much more. Oh and did I mention Chinese black Magic? This movie will definitely engulf your living room in green flame and keep you asking for more. Big Trouble in Little China is amazing. Action, adventure and comedy are all here, and the result is one of the best cult classic films of all time. I must have seen this movie 50+ times, and it never gets old. Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) is the character that everyone would like to be just for a day (maybe more). Driving around in The Pork Chop Express, beating up the bad guys, scoring with the ladies.....it's all in the reflexes for OI' Jack Burton! This is one of the most entertaining movies of the 80's, possibly ever!I grew up watching this film, seen now after 20.years of watching this film later, It is still my favorite awesome action film! Mainly because of Kurt Russell the man can kick ass! He has humor, charm and can do a good things. He was so funny and hilarious in this film. Gosh the film is wonderful and I just love it so much. Is actually my fourth best John Carpenter\/Kurt Russell film and I just love those four movies so much! I Love Big Trouble in Little China to death and It was hard to get this film on Blu-ray. It is one of John Carpenter's awesome adventures. Kurt Russell plays the egotistical Jack Burton extremely well, delivering the cheesy macho lines in the way they were intended. Beautifully filmed (the fight scene in the alley), this has been one of my favorites from Carpenter for a long time with Escape from New York, Escape from L.A. , The Thing, Prince of Darkness, The Fog and Vampires. Special effects are great, wonderful and outstanding! It is favorite Kurt Russell's performance, underrated gem of a movie, and one of the most quotable too. I love how this all started because Wang lost a drinking game to Jack. To this day I haven't seen anything like it.That's movie magic right there. Jack Burton should be in the top 10 movie characters ever!. San Francisco, CA-Jack Burton is possibly the greatest hero to ever walk the Earth at least in his own mind!!! The chemistry between Jack and Wang is so believable you want to see more adventure between the duo. This movie has a lot of fun, it is enjoyable flick it has imagination, great acting from all the actors, they all lightning us up with great performances. The action and adventures are super amazing, it is like you want to be in this movie! It has super fun characters in here and a cool awesome monster!Big Trouble in Little China is 80's classic! I love everything that it is in this film. I love the score, especially in the underworld. The battle in the alley when the 3 storms turn up is awesome. Don't see many films that transcend this many genres as well. I heard they are also planning to remake this film Big Trouble in Little China (2016) with Dwayne The Rock Johnson in it! Why? Only to get more money? Why remaking or rebooting this film?, when we already have a classic action film here! This film does not need any reboot or remake, leave it alone the way it is! Gosh The basic plot about this film is about Jack Burton (Kurt Russell) a simple man who doesn't believe in ghosts or magic until he's swept into a mind-boggling adventure deep within Chinatown's mysterious underworld. Burton's pal, Wang Chi (Dennis Dun), is trying to rescue his kidnapped fiancée. Egg Shen (Victor Wong), an enigmatic tour-bus driver seems to know a lot about ancient Chinese magic for a simple tour-bus driver. They do battle with an outlandish array of human and inhuman adversaries under the command of Lo Pan (James Hong), a 2000-year-old evil magician who has the power to transform himself from a wheelchair-bound old man into a seven-foot-tall mystical menace.

John Carpenter's The Thing is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made &#x96; fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them, making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?Seriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring across on screen the visual design. In my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since its release. I'll put any of The Thing's old-school effects up against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other ensemble. If you haven't seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I could see The Thing again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who's your friend? Who's the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If you've never seen this movie...your in for a treat.

John Carpenter's The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense, claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very well-paced, such as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and presenting the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, The Thing works on every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.The basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell's outstanding performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of the classic The Thing.

Once unfrozen, the form-changing alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.The Thing (also known as John Carpenter's The Thing) is a 1982 American science fiction horror film directed by John Carpenter, written by Bill Lancaster, and starring Kurt Russell.

John Carpenter's The Thing is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made &#x96; fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them, making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?Seriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring across on screen the visual design. In my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since its release. I'll put any of The Thing's old-school effects up against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other ensemble. If you haven't seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I could see The Thing again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who's your friend? Who's the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If you've never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the guy\/gal next to you really real?Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. John Carpenter's The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense, claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very well-paced, such as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and presenting the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, The Thing works on every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may be utilized to make horror films effective.

Though this horror comedy was not a success on its initial release in 1987, it subsequently developed an even-larger cult following, every year. Directed by Fred Dekker, and written by Shane Black. The movie tells the story of a group of kids call the Monster Squad, whom job is it, to stop a series of monsters, leaded by Count Dracula (Duncan Regehr), from taking over the world. Without spoiling the movie, too much; while it might seem, a bit silly and over-the top. It's honestly, a lot of fun to watch. I love, every minute of it! Yes, the extreme violence & gore, profanity, and dirty sex appeal might turn off, some parents from allowing their kids to watch this PG-13 film. However, as a kid of the early 1990s, I found this movie to be, awesome. Even, now as a mature adult, I find this movie, still very much, appealing; and wouldn't mind, allowing my children to see it, if they wanted to. After all, it's a lot tamer, than what children, see in movies, nowadays. Despite, being a little dated, there is a lot to like. I love how great the Universal Monsters The Mummy (Michael MacKay), The Gill-man (Tom Woodruff Jr.), The Wolf Man (Carl Thibault), and The Frankenstein's Monster (Tom Noonan), looked. However, some of the other, special effects, needed some work, such as the bats. Still, great work from Stan Winston and his team of special effects artists. Another thing, I like is, how well-acted, all the creatures were. Tom Noonan as Frankenstein's Monster & Duncan Regehr as Count Dracula are the best stand-outs. I love, their chemistry when face with the youngest member of the Monster Squad. It was iconic. Another great scene is the famous, Wolf Man got nards, scene. Even if, you never saw this film. You have, at least, heard of that scene! It's everywhere on the internet as a meme. If you have, saw this movie, you might agree with me, that for the most part, the film has pretty good pacing. There wasn't many boring or slow spots in Monster Squad. The movie is full of gut-blasting action, that you can't take, your eyes away from. Not only does, this movie treat your eyes, it also feeds your ears, some of the best 1980's kid movies music, you'll ever, listen to. This film indeed has an awesome soundtrack. Rock until you drop by Michael Sembello was truly rocking! Still, there are some things that I didn't like, about the film. Examples are, how respective clichéd all the main characters, are. Sean (Andree Gower), Patrick (Robby Kiger), Horace AKA Fat Kid, (Brent Chalem), Rudy (Ryan Lambert), Eugene (Michael Faustino) & Phoebe (Ashley Bank) don't have much, complexity. In my opinion, Eugene being the worst of the group. He literally does nearly nothing to help, further the plot. I really didn't like, the character, at all. I also dislike, the child's acting. He was so annoying. The other child actors weren't that bad, but they sure, wasn't great. It was just mediocre, at best. Another thing, worth criticizing, is the nonsensical plot. The movie doesn't do, a good job, explains, how the monsters got, in the present day. No part of this movie made any sense. The amulet, the diary, the search for a virgin, and even, the large amounts of weapons & explosives, they able to use. All these things, needed more exposition. It was so badly delivered. The worst, had to be Sean figuring out, that the monsters are alive, by finding out that Mr. Alucard is indeed Count. Dracula. It gave me, horrible 1990's Troll 2 flashbacks. Then, there, was the moments in the film, where this film, went to really dark, deep implications at times. A good example of this, is how the Scary German Guy (Leonardo Cimino), know so much about monsters. It was very jarring, compare to the rest of light-hearted and relax parts of the film. The movie also went, a little overboard on the mean-spirited jokes. I get the film, was going for uber-realistic on how, children, at the time, acted, but gees, some of the things, these kids, say, are, very offensive insults. Overall This 1980's cheesy high camp, horror comedy is a trick or treat flick, worth-checking out! Highly Entertaining. Do recommended.

One simply doesn't come across the film by accident on TV, watching it for what it is, so to speak. The common approach of seeing it to believe it can be at best exhilarating and at worst hostile. Unfortunately, the latter is usually, although quite understandably, the case. For how can one do anything but look down at a film that elitist snobs have praised for years and years? One simply must prove oneself right by falsifying the critics' claims, leaving the theater or the living room with a shrug and a condescending comment it was okay. This will not do. It is a great tragedy if Citizen Kane suffers from these kinds of incidents since it ought to be treated with the same kind of respect as Shakespeare's Hamlet or Beethoven's 9th Symphony. In order to make this happen, or perhaps enhance someone's viewing experience, I would like to try and explain not why Citizen Kane necessarily is the best film, but rather why people have considered it to be. There are over a thousand reviews of the film on this site, and mine will probably drown in the vast sea with them, but hey what can I lose, and who doesn't love talking about Welles and Citizen Kane?One might begin with the basic fact that Citizen Kane wasn't immediately praised and considered the best film that has blessed the silver screen. It was a financial risk for the RKO studios to give free hands to the novice prodigy Orson Welles, who had gained quite a reputation with the radio show of H. G. Wells' War of the Worlds, and not surprisingly it didn't pay off. Despite the praises of a few critics, Citizen Kane was soon forgotten, and the film wasn't, for example, screened at American cinemas during the late 1940's and early 50's. In France, however, the film was just discovered after the war, and the leading critic of the country, André Bazin hailed it as a masterpiece of the postwar stylistic tendency he characterized as spatial realism. Bazin's disciples, who we all know now as the nouvelle vague directors, followed and adored Welles' masterpiece. François Truffaut proclaimed that everything that matters in cinema after 1940 has been influenced by 'Citizen Kane'. Thus the film's reputation grew and its new found reputation slowly found the other side of the Atlantic as well. But why did this happen? Why wasn't Citizen Kane forgotten, and why, for one, did it arouse the interest of Bazin?First, it ought to be highlighted that the story of Citizen Kane is excellent. Loosely based on the life and times of media mogul William Hearst, Citizen Kane tells the story about a lonely giant who conquered the American media. It's a story about a man who dedicated his life to possession, but tragically became to be possessed by it himself. As one might have noticed, I am using the past tense, and such is the nature of Welles' narrative in Citizen Kane. The film begins with the protagonist's death, and then portrays the attempts of a journalist trying to figure out the meaning of his last words -- Rosebud -- by interviewing people who knew the man. It will probably turn out to be a very simple thing, he supposes. This kind of structure was not considered the done thing back in the day. Although the basic structure of finding out a person's past goes back to Sophocles' Oedipus Rex as well as numerous detective stories, the uniqueness of Citizen Kane lies in the use of different perspectives, creating a non-linear narrative that has echoes from ancient drama and epistolary novels. Yet it wasn't really the intricate story that most fascinated Bazin. What Bazin emphasized was the film's style. Although all scholars have given up on the phoenix myth of Citizen Kane and its innovative use of various cinematic means, it is simply a fact that the film made the style public, thus standardizing it for Hollywood. The aesthetic features of the so-called spatial realism, which Bazin adored, supported by the technological innovation of the BNC camera, include deep-focus cinematography, sequence shots, and deep-space composition. These had been used before, but hardly with similar, dare I say, philosophic unity. This stylistic tendency is enhanced by Welles' relentless use of heavy low-angle shots and dynamic montage sequences. There are innovative cuts that spark imagination and soundtrack solutions that open the story and its characters to new dimensions. Citizen Kane is often celebrated as a bravura of the art of mise-en-scène since it puts a lot of emphasis on pre-filmic elements such as setting and lighting, but the real gist of the film's brilliance lies in the unity of these together with cinematographic and post-filmic elements.More remains to be said, but space is running out. The end of the matter is, I guess, that none of the individual elements of Citizen Kane are, precisely, individual. They have not been distinguished from one another, but rather resonate luminously together in a unique fashion. Technological innovation goes hand in hand with aesthetic inspiration and both support the whole of story, theme, and style. Such unity may not have been present in Hollywood before 1941. From the groundbreaking use of the BNC camera to themes of power, loneliness, and defeat, which are reflected on the level of style, using setting and editing, for one, to reflect the emotional distances between the characters or their existential experience of emptiness, Citizen Kane remains a gem to any lover of cinema. It's up there with immortal works of art from poetry, music, and painting. It is, like all great art, a tightly and beautifully sealed original whole which is why (instead of one big nameable innovation) the film has been considered to be of such magnificent proportions.

Jim Henson's Creature Shop designs where outstanding which the animatronics did work for the film as well as its predecessor. I love Jim Henson's Creature Shop! Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II The Secret of the Ooze is still my favorite childhood memories film that I have always enjoyed and I always will. There isn't any drama in it, which I like it, there is a lot of comedy in it a lot funny moments, less sadness in it. Raphael, Leonardo, Michelangelo and Donatello are awesome!!!The main problem with the film I have Turtles don't use weapons at all, There they are caught in a well laid trap and Leonardo could cut the net with his swords and he did not. In stead awesome Splinter had to save them, that was a little disappointment for me, but a good thing to do for a Splinter character, because in this film, he did bot do almost anything except siting trough whole film. But firing with a bow and arrow cutting the net was awesome from Splinter! Shredder almost do nothing trough whole film, he only yells and talks trough whole film, also I am confused how was resurrected if he was killed on the end of the first film? He is not a superhuman gosh! Shredder He emerges transformed him self into a Super Shredder! He ends up destroying himself and is gone for good, he destroys all the pier and doesn't do anything, he didn't attack the Turtles, he just destroyed the pier with himself stupid. Why didn't Turtles used weapons on Tokka and Rahzar? They could slice them to dust with the weapons. I wish that, they had Casey Jones instead of Keno in it. I did not like a new sidekick to Turtles, Keno.Anyway the film has some flaws, but I still enjoy it and I still love it!!! I love The sequel to the original movie. It is still at least my favorite film of the trilogy. I love the fight scenes with the foot clan, and with thieves in the beginning of the film! GREAT opening sequence when the TMNT fly over Keno and kick butt in the toy store. Awesome storyline to connect their origin..... to the Ooze and TGRI.

I need to always remind myself of this line. Too many times I have not watched certain movies due to the premise not appealing to me or having seen terrible reviews. Then I have to remind myself of 2 things (1) Most movies nowadays pretty much suck out of the gate, AND (2) Many movies of yesteryear actually hold up because they by default have so much going for them genuine dialogue, more practical effects, better and original stories. There are films that I never dared watch as a kid that I have since re-visited that have become personal faves.This Halloween treat HOCUS POCUS (1993) has become a holiday favorite of mine having seen it for the first time marathon-ing a slew of Halloween-themed movies. While it's definitely flawed, it's funnier than 99.9% of the comedies now. Hell, let's just for the even 100! Hocus Pocus is the tale of 3 Salem witch siblings who were persecuted in the 17th century, but are revived 300 years later on All Hallows Eve 1993 by the opening of their book of spells by an unwitting teenager named Max (skillfully played by Omri Katz of Dallas fame; he played the character John Ross Ewing for the longest time frame in the original series). Katz does a commendable job carrying the kid portion of the film, but it's the witches themselves who steal the show!The 3 witches are hilariously realized by Bette Midler (Winifred), Kathy Najimy (Mary), and Sarah Jessica Parker (Sarah). Midler, Najimy, and Parker are a laugh riot throughout, with Midler the crafty, witty, wisecracking oldest sister, Najimy the goofy middle sister, and Parker the ditzy youngest sister. I even dare say that as hilarious as Midler and Najimy were, it was Parker who stole the show perfectly playing the brainless blonde bombshell! Parker is so effortlessy ditzy and sexy in this, I'm surprised she never really played another role like this at any other time in her career. She's almost unrecognizable. Also, this is perhaps my favorite of all of Midler's comic performances. She really lets loose here as this is probably her most broad comic role. Midler also makes the best, most funny facial expressions. And Najimy's acting choice of making her character slur her speech totally works and would have sunk in the hands of a lesser comedic talent. And I love the way the 3 actresses show the symbiotic relationship of the witches and do things in sync throughout the fim.The kid cast isn't half bad either. The aforementioned Katz is all in and exudes charisma as the put-upon teenage newcomer to Salem, as his family has just moved from LA to put down roots in the infamous, historical town. Katz gets great support from then-child actress and scene-stealer Thora Birch (playing Max's precocious younger sister Dani) and fashion-model-actress Vinessa Shaw (as Max's love interest Allison). Shaw is kind of the weak link among the kids as she is obviously more mature than Katz and it's somewhat of a stretch at times she'd be attracted to Max's clutzy, innocent character. Although it's always nice when the nerd gets the girl! Also, there are a few memorable minor characters, most notably the zombified Billy Butcherson (played memorably by Doug Jones), and also the 2 teen bullies who harass Max and steal candy from the trick-or-treaters, the bus driver who has the hots for the witches, the cop who doesn't believe the kids story about the witches, and none other than Garry and Penny Marshall, who play a rather creepy married couple.

Also, Parker gets to show off her singing chops with a spellbinding rendition of Come Little Children during the film's climax.

Too many times I have not watched certain movies due to the premise not appealing to me or having seen terrible reviews.

There are films that I never dared watch as a kid that I have since re-visited that have become personal faves.This Halloween treat HOCUS POCUS (1993) has become a holiday favorite of mine having seen it for the first time marathon-ing a slew of Halloween-themed movies. While it's definitely flawed, it's funnier than 99.9% of the comedies now. Hell, let's just for the even 100! Hocus Pocus is the tale of 3 Salem witch siblings who were persecuted in the 17th century, but are revived 300 years later on All Hallows Eve 1993 by the opening of their book of spells by an unwitting teenager named Max (skillfully played by Omri Katz of Dallas fame; he played the character John Ross Ewing for the longest time frame in the original series). Katz does a commendable job carrying the kid portion of the film, but it's the witches themselves who steal the show!The 3 witches are hilariously realized by Bette Midler (Winifred), Kathy Najimy (Mary), and Sarah Jessica Parker (Sarah). Midler, Najimy, and Parker are a laugh riot throughout, with Midler the crafty, witty, wisecracking oldest sister, Najimy the goofy middle sister, and Parker the ditzy youngest sister. I even dare say that as hilarious as Midler and Najimy were, it was Parker who stole the show perfectly playing the brainless blonde bombshell! Parker is so effortlessy ditzy and sexy in this, I'm surprised she never really played another role like this at any other time in her career. She's almost unrecognizable. Also, this is perhaps my favorite of all of Midler's comic performances. She really lets loose here as this is probably her most broad comic role. Midler also makes the best, most funny facial expressions. And Najimy's acting choice of making her character slur her speech totally works and would have sunk in the hands of a lesser comedic talent. And I love the way the 3 actresses show the symbiotic relationship of the witches and do things in sync throughout the fim.The kid cast isn't half bad either. The aforementioned Katz is all in and exudes charisma as the put-upon teenage newcomer to Salem, as his family has just moved from LA to put down roots in the infamous, historical town. Katz gets great support from then-child actress and scene-stealer Thora Birch (playing Max's precocious younger sister Dani) and fashion-model-actress Vinessa Shaw (as Max's love interest Allison).

It's one that grabs you right from the beginning and doesn't let go, and it leaves an effect that is profoundly disturbing. Not due to any grotesque shock value, but by emotion. Maybe even more so than in any other horror movie that I've ever seen, it has such a tremendous depth of emotion. The tone is always dead on and perfect and it can really can make you feel whatever it's setting out to. Watching it recently, it made me think about what actually makes a horror movie just that. Most of it plays out like a tense drama with a strange darkness to it, one that really dives into grim horror as it nears its bitter end. It's a real mixture of tones, and thankfully a very effective one. The score itself works like a character and is a huge part of the film's enduring appeal. I mean what fan ever thinks of this picture and doesn't also automatically think of that iconic music? You don't even have to say to someone Think of the music of Carrie, you can just say Think of Carrie and that achingly poignant theme will pop into someone's head, and that's one of the biggest compliments you could ever give a score. Can't believe they've attempted to remake this twice, give it up fools! Try to think up your own damn ideas, you will never surpass the original, your reboots deserved to flop. In my opinion it's the chemistry and combined performances of Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie that truly drive this film and make it so very exceptional. Carrie is such an innocent pure and fragile waif of a girl who happens to possess a very dangerous special gift, and you really feel that she's been through hell. It may sound cold but all my sympathy lies with her for all that she goes through and how she ends up, becoming a figure of nightmare, a 'devil', it's almost as though her mother has won. And Piper Laurie, wow! She cuts such an imposing and commanding woman. Her face had such a kind, almost saintly glow to it. You'd never know what a monster she was. And I'd say she was, because she kept her own daughter's womanhood completely unknown to her and never told her what to expect, and when she does come home traumatised from the humiliating ordeal she declares it a sin and locks Carrie up in the closet with the terrifying idol of Christ. She uses her own twisted religion as an excuse to treat her daughter so poorly, no wonder that she winds up ironically getting crucified by her. The magnificent prom sequence is dazzlingly shot and choreographed. It plays out like delicate glass that shatters with the fateful splattering of the pig's blood... Absolutely phenomenal and flawless buildup and payoff. After all that it's so heartbreaking to watch, all of her hopes and dreams for a normal life are literally in ashes, and she has nowhere to go and no one to turn to except an insane mother who stabs her in the back. That final scene still gives me a chill to this day. The way the rock tumbles out of the way as the bloody arm lashes out and grabs onto the guilt-ridden Sue. Sheer brilliance, it's one legendary jump-scare of an ending that leaves a haunting memory... So moving, horrific, and tragic, and just plain overall a masterful horror film. I always did love it very much, thank you. I pray you find Jesus!

I think it's taking inspiration from some of the old episodes and it's good to take inspiration from something if you can pull it off.I don't want to give away too much about the movie as I want you to watch it just like I did by knowing nothing.

Grace is suffering from amnesia and is in a catatonic state whereby she only speaks when she yells things out in her sleep. Grace is released in to the care of private eye Mike Church (Kenneth Branagh) who attempts to try and piece Grace's life back together and attempts to get to the bottom of who Grace is and also why she is having these strange visions. Church gets some unexpected help from antiques dealer and hypnotist Franklyn Madson (Derek Jacobi). Through a series of hypnosis sessions, Grace starts to re-discover her past life, but forming these memories again comes at a cost...Dead Again has a very impressive opening few minutes; the credits showing various tabloid articles and then the opening scene with Roman Strauss (also Kenneth Branagh) and news reporter Gray Baker (Andy Garcia) was quite chilling and it also allowed Branagh to be Hannibal Lecter for a few minutes.Once the impressive opener is out of the way, the film takes a rather slow-burning approach in developing its story. Yes it is a slow film, but it's not a film that I found boring. As with any good mystery film, all the building blocks are put in place and every scene gradually adds another piece to the puzzle. As a whole, the story is engaging, suspenseful and unpredictable and I must admit for the most part I was interested in how the events were unfolding and in which direction the story was going to take. All these elements are what make the film worth watching. However...I have to admit to being taken surprise by the turn of events later in the film specifically with regards to the idea that both Roman and Margaret had been reincarnated. I mean sure there had to be some link back to their past, but this was not what I was expecting. It becomes even more ludicrous when we learn that they've been reincarnated as different genders. It's one of those twists where I praise it because of how much it surprised me, but also one that I want to condemn for being so ludicrous. However, I'm leaning more towards being positive about because it's a rather unique twist and because it did surprise me. The issue I had with this twist is that it felt like screenwriter Scott Frank was trying to force his own beliefs on to his audience. It isn't implied here that they have been reincarnated or even suggested, but we're actually told that they have been reincarnated. To me, forcing such an agenda on people based on a concept which is merely a myth or superstition is arrogant and rather silly. Don't get me wrong I'm all for exploring the concept of reincarnation and I'm all for getting people thinking about it, but to make believe that it is real is misleading to say the least. It's heavy-handedness like this that brings the film down slightly which is a shame because it is very effective in almost every other area.Despite the heavy-handed and questionable reincarnation twist, the film does get a lot of praise from me for having an involving, suspenseful and unpredictable storyline. Many of the performances here help make the picture enjoyable and the likes of Branagh, Jacobi and Thompson were all excellent - although I only found Branagh compelling as Roman Strauss and didn't think he was as good in his role of private eye Mike Church. Garcia is OK in a supporting role, Williams did OK with what he had to work with - his character was interesting, but his role was severely underwritten. Wayne Knight was annoying and for me was an unnecessary and distracting addition to the film.As it is Dead Again is a very good film, but one that could have been even better with a less heavy-handed approach.

His father wants him to stay in the school but he is forced to take him home and now he is concerned that his brides family will find out he has bad genes or something.

Will the father step back and let nature take its course or will his love for the boy finally wake him up to the fact that his son has always been a blessing on him, not a weight around his neck. And will his decision come in time to save his soul and the boy's life? The makers of this movie prove that excellence knows no border and cannot be stifled. ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Family"},{"date":"31 October 2015","score":"","review":" My dad was a big fan of scary movies, and he and I watched a ton of them when I was growing up--probably more slasher flicks than an adolescent should be allowed to see. But I always remember him talking about how his favorite was The Haunting. He had a recorded copy of it on VHS, and he loved to go on about how it was the best scary movie ever made, but for some reason we never watched it together--though I did remember bits and pieces that I must have caught along the way at some point.That said, I caught it on Turner Classic this week, and I have to say it was a bit of a let down. This is a film that was made in 1963, a good fifteen years before the advent of the 80's slasher films and the more grotesque genre of horror film that has come to dominate the genre ever since. When this film was made, there were two kinds of horror movies monster movies in the style of Dracula, The Mummy, and various 50's B-rate flicks; and Alfred Hitchcock-inspired films in the style of Psycho and Rebecca. The Haunting fits into the latter category. Indeed, having seen the whole thing, I'm very surprised that it's not in fact a Hitchcock film, as it follows the Hitchcock formula closely. The movie is made in black and white, and the acting is rigid like a classic film. The script could carry over well into a theatre production, and for the style of film that it is the movie is extremely well made--well shot, well produced, etc.Still, I just found it hard to get into. Perhaps that's because of my age, as a Gen-Xer. I enjoy classic film, but horror is probably my least favorite genre of the classics, since the style is so different--and so less scary--than a modern day horror vibe. And so, while I found this film to be exceptional in terms of style and production quality, I can't help but mark it down in terms of likability. 5\/10 stars.
