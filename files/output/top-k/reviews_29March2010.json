But I find I do take it seriously and it leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth.The premise is dubious where it is not actually odious. It is proposing that it is better to live with childish delusions than to become a responsible adult. Fine, if you are cushioned by a large independent income, like Elwood, but what if you aren't? Even more deplorable is the revelation that forms the climax of the movie the mentally ill are better and happier than sane people. This is not only rubbish; it is offensive to anyone with the slightest acquaintance with mental illnessThen again, how happy is Elwood supposed to be? He is genial and harmless and he grins a lot, but he cannot relate to people and has no real friends. Most people avoid him like the plague and even he acknowledges that most of his casual barroom acquaintances don't come back a second time.He may be living a completely care-free life, but what a life! He is just frittering away his time, drinking in bars. The implication is that he is a happy alcoholic, but this is a blatant cheat, since we never see him really drunk.The part is atrociously written and poorly played. Whatever was intended to be the case, Elwood is clearly a ponderous bore. It is no wonder that sober people can't stand him. Stewart tries to redeem the character with his own natural likability, but his stuttering performance only intensifies the problem. And don't believe those people who claim that Stewart almost convinces them that they can see Harvey for themselves. Stewart's mime is both minimal and unconvincing.The other characters are similarly misconceived. His sister is a shrieking hysteric; his niece is a desperate man-eater who throws herself at the first thing in pants that shows any interest in her; Dr Sanderson is an arrogant blustering bully, etc. etc. They are all supposed to become better people through their encounters with Elwood, but these transformations are declared rather than dramatised. For example, Dr Clumpson's improbable 'volt face' occurs off-screen, in a scene that is inexplicably missing from the movie, probably because even Mary Chase could not find a way to make it work.Whatever faint wisp of plot the movie contains is entirely driven by a series of farcical misconceptions that arise because nobody is able to speak coherently and nobody listens to what anybody else is saying. As a result, people continually leap to unjustified conclusions, over-react and then launch into scarcely-motivated hyper-activity. Most disturbingly, they are constantly being rounded up and bundled in and out of the asylum with scant excuse and no due process.As the movie jumps from one random improbability to another it is hardly worth mentioning that Harvey is seldom even supposed to be present.The movie suggests that there is actually a serious question peeking out from behind the façade of frantic farce 'who is mad and who is sane?' However, it can only make this bogus question seem even faintly pertinent by having everyone act at least as crazily as Elwood.

Directed by James Ivory, produced by Ismail Merchant and written by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, it is a remarkably faithful adaptation of the novel, and on top of this is also an elegant, nuanced and fascinating film.The period detail is perfect. What I loved about A Room with a View especially was its gorgeous Italian settings. Here it is just as gorgeous, while also having a certain elegance about it. You can never go wrong with beautiful scenery, wondrous costumes and elegant-looking locations, Howards End had all three of those. The music is also a marvel, beautiful, haunting and hypnotic, somewhat reminiscent of a Phillip Glass score, while having a few snatches of Percy Grainger and Beethoven too.The script is very faithful in style to the book and warmth and depth is given to the characters, and the direction is sensitive and nuanced very like how it was in A Room with a View. The plot is quite complex, even on first viewing I found it a little hard to keep up with everything. Then again, this is the sort of film you may need to see more than once. It is quite slow moving, and at over 140 minutes hard to sit through in one sitting, but the period detail, music, screenplay and acting made the film pleasurable, elegant and even moving.Speaking of the acting, the whole cast give very strong performances, while not standing out from one another. Emma Thompson is endearingly-beautiful in Howards End, more beautiful than she looked in Much Ado About Nothing, and gives a moving and spirited portrayal of Margaret.

But none quite as radiant and loving as she does in this outstanding family drama. In fact, I wouldn't have thought this a part for Streep at all (this is Susan Sarandon territory). Streep is the total wife and mother to her English professor husband, and published author (William Hurt), and two adult children who have come home to celebrate their father's 55th birthday. I remember liking this movie a lot when it was first released in theaters. I found a copy of the DVD and bought it and last night watched it. I had an entirely different appreciation for Anna Quinlan's richly observed story of a family in crisis as the result of the mother's suffering from a harrowing illness. This is not a spoiler. You know the mother has cancer from the very first frame. My recollection was that Streep was playing a tightly controlled Martha Stewart-type domestic perfectionist and of course, watching it the second time, I realized nothing could be further from the truth. At first you are lulled into thinking this might be the case. She throws a costume birthday party for her husband and seems ridiculous dressed as an aging Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz, complete with ruby red slippers and a toy Toto. When her daughter, played by Renee Zelwegger is in the kitchen with her mother, she finds herself corrected constantly but only because her daughter has rejected her mother's domesticity and in the family home, she is a stranger in a strange land--inept and uninterested. The day after the party, we learn that Streep's character is being kept in the hospital for surgery, and suddenly Dad is insisting that his daughter take leave from her job as a reporter for New York Magazine, and stay home to take care of her ailing mother. Bristling with resentment, she obeys her beloved father's demands, but this sets up the stage for many shifting changes in the family dynamic. Tellingly, the daughter says at upfront that she was never close to her mother, and was the perfect Daddy's little girl. She emulated her father to the point where she also became a writer, and looks to him for approval, which he is rather stingy with and often with backhanded criticisms. Meanwhile, the daughter takes on the chores of running the household while taking on the duties of ministering to her mother. She makes lunch for her mother's club, The Minnie's, a group of the town's women who do lots of beautifying and other civic chores. She arrogantly assumes, it's not big deal to cook, but can't cook a lick and the badly prepared meal lays on the plates, mostly untouched. But her mother's praise for her daughter's effort is genuine and laced with love. As Daddy's feet of clay become more brittle, the mother's non-judgmental behavior and warmth and appreciation for her daughter begins to open the younger woman's eyes to the reality of her parent's marriage. Daddy's probable infidelities, his vanity, his literary snobbishness and willingness to kiss ass of a visiting writer he idolizes, show him to be less of a hero in his daughter's eyes. Worse, she see that he does nothing in the house to help make his wife more comfortable, and he increasingly stays away as her condition deteriorates. The daughter's resentment builds to confrontation that leaves her confused and more angry. There's a telling scene near the end of the movie when Streep confronts her daughter about her anger at her father. It is in this beautifully staged scene with Streep and Zelwegger playing superbly together, that the mother reveals to her daughter that she knows everything her daughter knows about her father. She has made her accommodations because that is what you do in a long marriage. She neither asks for her daughter's sympathy, or the audience's indulgence. She's not one of those embarrassed politician's wives who have been humiliated in public and then made to feel shame for sticking it out. She has created a loving home for her family. The mother in this film simply plays her part--as does her husband in this relationship. Streep is absolutely at her subtle best here, never never sacrificing the dignity of this dying woman. There could have been plenty of opportunity to go for the emotionally-charged big moment, but Streep refuses to ask us to feel sorry for her. She is totally in the moment of this character's situation and she's utterly fabulous. Zelwegger, an often outstanding screen actress who has become a bit mannered and fussy in her recent roles, shows how this character has matured through grief and anger, and as she begins to see just how great a mother she's always had, we share those revelations. William Hurt doesn't flinch from this unlikeable character, and the final revelation is cathartic. He's never been my favorite actor, often taking on roles that are hard to like. But his work is rich in characterization and he never overplays or reaches for a cheap emotional payoff either. The role of the brother is not very detailed here, nor is Zellweger rather caddish boyfriend. It was nice to see the young Lauren Graham, playing Zellweger's best friend--her delightful Lorelai Gilmore persona in chrysalis. In many ways, ONE TRUE THING is a throwback--an absorbing family drama full of words and emotions, a throwback to the era of the woman's pictures of the 30s and 40s. The three main characters never lose their focus. A very fine movie, well worth your time.

The day after the party, we learn that Streep's character is being kept in the hospital for surgery, and suddenly Dad is insisting that his daughter take leave from her job as a reporter for New York Magazine, and stay home to take care of her ailing mother. Bristling with resentment, she obeys her beloved father's demands, but this sets up the stage for many shifting changes in the family dynamic. Tellingly, the daughter says at upfront that she was never close to her mother, and was the perfect Daddy's little girl. She emulated her father to the point where she also became a writer, and looks to him for approval, which he is rather stingy with and often with backhanded criticisms. Meanwhile, the daughter takes on the chores of running the household while taking on the duties of ministering to her mother. She makes lunch for her mother's club, The Minnie's, a group of the town's women who do lots of beautifying and other civic chores. She arrogantly assumes, it's not big deal to cook, but can't cook a lick and the badly prepared meal lays on the plates, mostly untouched. But her mother's praise for her daughter's effort is genuine and laced with love. As Daddy's feet of clay become more brittle, the mother's non-judgmental behavior and warmth and appreciation for her daughter begins to open the younger woman's eyes to the reality of her parent's marriage. Daddy's probable infidelities, his vanity, his literary snobbishness and willingness to kiss ass of a visiting writer he idolizes, show him to be less of a hero in his daughter's eyes. Worse, she see that he does nothing in the house to help make his wife more comfortable, and he increasingly stays away as her condition deteriorates. The daughter's resentment builds to confrontation that leaves her confused and more angry. There's a telling scene near the end of the movie when Streep confronts her daughter about her anger at her father. It is in this beautifully staged scene with Streep and Zelwegger playing superbly together, that the mother reveals to her daughter that she knows everything her daughter knows about her father. She has made her accommodations because that is what you do in a long marriage. She neither asks for her daughter's sympathy, or the audience's indulgence. She's not one of those embarrassed politician's wives who have been humiliated in public and then made to feel shame for sticking it out. She has created a loving home for her family. The mother in this film simply plays her part--as does her husband in this relationship. Streep is absolutely at her subtle best here, never never sacrificing the dignity of this dying woman. There could have been plenty of opportunity to go for the emotionally-charged big moment, but Streep refuses to ask us to feel sorry for her. She is totally in the moment of this character's situation and she's utterly fabulous. Zelwegger, an often outstanding screen actress who has become a bit mannered and fussy in her recent roles, shows how this character has matured through grief and anger, and as she begins to see just how great a mother she's always had, we share those revelations. William Hurt doesn't flinch from this unlikeable character, and the final revelation is cathartic. He's never been my favorite actor, often taking on roles that are hard to like. But his work is rich in characterization and he never overplays or reaches for a cheap emotional payoff either. The role of the brother is not very detailed here, nor is Zellweger rather caddish boyfriend. It was nice to see the young Lauren Graham, playing Zellweger's best friend--her delightful Lorelai Gilmore persona in chrysalis. In many ways, ONE TRUE THING is a throwback--an absorbing family drama full of words and emotions, a throwback to the era of the woman's pictures of the 30s and 40s. The three main characters never lose their focus. A very fine movie, well worth your time.

But none quite as radiant and loving as she does in this outstanding family drama. In fact, I wouldn't have thought this a part for Streep at all (this is Susan Sarandon territory). Streep is the total wife and mother to her English professor husband, and published author (William Hurt), and two adult children who have come home to celebrate their father's 55th birthday. I remember liking this movie a lot when it was first released in theaters. I found a copy of the DVD and bought it and last night watched it. I had an entirely different appreciation for Anna Quinlan's richly observed story of a family in crisis as the result of the mother's suffering from a harrowing illness. This is not a spoiler. You know the mother has cancer from the very first frame. My recollection was that Streep was playing a tightly controlled Martha Stewart-type domestic perfectionist and of course, watching it the second time, I realized nothing could be further from the truth. At first you are lulled into thinking this might be the case. She throws a costume birthday party for her husband and seems ridiculous dressed as an aging Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz, complete with ruby red slippers and a toy Toto.

In the commentary Boyle explains that he generally avoids back-story, which is undoubtedly a sound approach, especially in thrillers. But the drawback in this movie is that everything ends up in the same dimension. Nothing is in relief, nothing in the plot casts shadow or throws light. This happens and then that happens and for what reason and anticipating what end aren't very important. Basic storytelling starts with character X wanting something. Boyle's first movie, Shallow Grave, is such a fine movie because of how well that principle is put into effect. In that case, the thing wanted, i.e., the money, is basic and self-explanatory as a motivation.The characters in The Beach are drifters and pleasure-seekers to whom nothing seems like such a big deal. I have no idea how you can build a thriller around that, but one thing I know would have helped would have been to give the actors better-drawn characters to work with. Some pretty terrific actors, including Virginie Ledoyen, Patterson Joseph and above all Tilda Swinton, are wasted in underwritten roles here. They do interesting things from time to time, but they always fade almost immediately until they are brought forward again to serve the plot. The movie feels like a showpiece for DiCaprio (and, briefly, Carlyle), and his acting is remarkable, especially considering that the writing of his character is pretty unfocused too.

It's not necessarily due to the lack of monsters and horror but more because this movie is a bit of a lackluster. It just isn't a very exciting movie to watch.But even so, I still really liked this movie. To me Peter Cushing really is the definitive Sherlock Holmes. I would had loved to see him play the character more often. He did played the character a couple of times again in a BBC produced series and again in 1984, in one of his last movies, The Masks of Death, directed by former Hammer studios director Roy Ward Baker. But of course all of these productions lack the Hammer touch and feel, that made all those movies so distinctive. It was a real perfect combination, the Sherlock Holmes character and universe, Peter Cushing and the Hammer studios. Whenever I think of Sherlock Holmes, it still is an image of Peter Cushing that pops up into my mind first. He was that perfect for the role.It's also really true that it's one of Cushing's best acting roles. Seemed he really enjoyed playing the iconic character and got really into his role. Other Hammer icon Christopher Lee is also in the movie and he played a good and enjoyable role in it as well. It was actually one of the first movies Cushing and Lee appeared together in, after the of course more well known 1958 Dracula version, with Lee as the count and Cushing as vampire killer Van Helsing.For this movie the two also teamed up again with director Terence Fisher, who is one of the most recognizable names from the Hammer studios period as a director. He directed a large amount of movies for the British studios and among them are the very best and also best known ones, such as most of the Dracula and Frankenstein movies. Ironicaly he would also direct a later Sherlock Holmes movie, with this time Christopher Lee as the pipe-smoking detective.The movie its story got based on one of the Arthur Conan Doyle novels. I think that without a doubt the Hound of the Baskervilles is the most filmed Sherlock Holmes novel. I don't really see why really, as it really isn't the most spectacularly mysterious or thrilling tense story. It only has an handful of characters in it, which does not work to well for the mystery and whodunit element of the story. Besides, there isn't always a lot happening in the story. Sherlock Holmes himself is also out of the movie for too long, too often.The movie has a real Hammer studios look and atmosphere to it. Some exterior shots got obviously shot inside of a studio, with fake looking sets, backdrops and of course an inevitable smoke-machine. To me this is no complaint really. It is what makes the Hammer studios so unique and strangely appealing and charming to watch.

The camera-work is beautiful, it's the slow sensual gliding that feels like choreography for a ballet ensemble or maybe like someone's hand slipping under the hem of a skirt, but I find the points of interest it brings together and the suggestions that emerge in this linking (in Jost's cinema as a whole or at least based on what I've seen) superficial and labored.Whereas in Frameup Jost's experimental technique got in the way of characters with a potentially interesting story waiting to be told, here I had the opposite reaction, interesting form beind sidetracked by flat uninteresting characters, possibly a story not worth the telling. The movie inhabits the lofts and galleries of Soho, the world of MoMa exhibitions and small coffee shops, its girls are sweet shy and cultured, they want to be actresses or sopranos and they care enough about the rainforest to call daddy and yell at him for bying stocks of gum companies in their name, and it's never quite clear where Jost sees himself in all this. His characters are self-involved and egopathic but his criticism against them is not as scathing (or as obvious) as in Frameup. The two male characters we see in the film are curious prototypes, the one is the angry artist throwing a temper tantrum because his agent won't lend him money, the other is the mature love interest, the stockbroker in the white horse come to sweep the young French girl off her feet.Of course it doesn't quite work this way, and it neither does for the movie. The story takes place in New York but it's not Woody Allen's Manhattan, it's not so much about finding or losing love, romance or even alienation, as it is about obligation, about our right to not be obliged to be anything if we don't want it, not even good or loyal or in love. The movie has the feeling of walking inside an art gallery, with some of that quality quiet and alert in the same time, with something cold and irrevocable like you're sitting on a bench and you can hear the echo of someone else's footsteps reverberating from a different room (they stop and it's quiet and then you can hear them again), punctuating the story with long neat tracking shots over polished mahogany floors and in endless dervish circles around marble pillars, with symmetrical shots arranged in orderly patterns, but Jost delivers his thing with perhaps a little too much minimalism, like he's too proud and 'left-field' to dramatize properly, so that even the premise of his movie slowly begins to hide from it.In the end Jost has to go looking for his premise. He finds it curled up in a dark corner of the museum, panting and naked, and he brings it kicking and screaming to the light. Our female protagonist begins narrating the point of the movie and Jost is literally speaking through her, hammering home an indifferent point in outrageous explanatory fashion, like all the subtlety of nuance that came before were but tools of their own destruction, so that we have 98% of a movie that is too vague and transparent and 2% that is anti-tank steel 5 inches thick. Maybe this is Jost the frustrated artist, who wants every last one in his audience to get him or maybe it was all an essay and he simply feels the need to conclude.

The camera-work is beautiful, it's the slow sensual gliding that feels like choreography for a ballet ensemble or maybe like someone's hand slipping under the hem of a skirt, but I find the points of interest it brings together and the suggestions that emerge in this linking (in Jost's cinema as a whole or at least based on what I've seen) superficial and labored.Whereas in Frameup Jost's experimental technique got in the way of characters with a potentially interesting story waiting to be told, here I had the opposite reaction, interesting form beind sidetracked by flat uninteresting characters, possibly a story not worth the telling. The movie inhabits the lofts and galleries of Soho, the world of MoMa exhibitions and small coffee shops, its girls are sweet shy and cultured, they want to be actresses or sopranos and they care enough about the rainforest to call daddy and yell at him for bying stocks of gum companies in their name, and it's never quite clear where Jost sees himself in all this. His characters are self-involved and egopathic but his criticism against them is not as scathing (or as obvious) as in Frameup. The two male characters we see in the film are curious prototypes, the one is the angry artist throwing a temper tantrum because his agent won't lend him money, the other is the mature love interest, the stockbroker in the white horse come to sweep the young French girl off her feet.Of course it doesn't quite work this way, and it neither does for the movie. The story takes place in New York but it's not Woody Allen's Manhattan, it's not so much about finding or losing love, romance or even alienation, as it is about obligation, about our right to not be obliged to be anything if we don't want it, not even good or loyal or in love. The movie has the feeling of walking inside an art gallery, with some of that quality quiet and alert in the same time, with something cold and irrevocable like you're sitting on a bench and you can hear the echo of someone else's footsteps reverberating from a different room (they stop and it's quiet and then you can hear them again), punctuating the story with long neat tracking shots over polished mahogany floors and in endless dervish circles around marble pillars, with symmetrical shots arranged in orderly patterns, but Jost delivers his thing with perhaps a little too much minimalism, like he's too proud and 'left-field' to dramatize properly, so that even the premise of his movie slowly begins to hide from it.In the end Jost has to go looking for his premise. He finds it curled up in a dark corner of the museum, panting and naked, and he brings it kicking and screaming to the light. Our female protagonist begins narrating the point of the movie and Jost is literally speaking through her, hammering home an indifferent point in outrageous explanatory fashion, like all the subtlety of nuance that came before were but tools of their own destruction, so that we have 98% of a movie that is too vague and transparent and 2% that is anti-tank steel 5 inches thick. Maybe this is Jost the frustrated artist, who wants every last one in his audience to get him or maybe it was all an essay and he simply feels the need to conclude.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"29 March 2010","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" There's a few ways one could approach the material of To Die For, and one of those is to make it a straight melodrama, the saga of a woman who was an ambitious, sweet-faced and psychotic woman who would stop at nothing to get what she wanted. But director Gus Van Sant, by way of Buck Henry's incisive and daring screenplay, eschews melodrama for a really dark comedy perhaps not too unlike Network, only this time we don't feel sorry for the lead character the way we do here. Suzanne Stone is no Howard Beale. She's an All-American Girl, Waspy, beautiful (stunningly so), and has that look in her eyes that could kill a kitten if it needed to. And she wants to be famous - really famous, since she's on TV. She doesn't want to be a great journalist like a Mike Wallace, but a personality, like Connie Chung (Not Povich, as she points out), and will do anything to get it, which includes recruiting unwitting (and kinda outright spot-on dumb) teenagers into a murder plot to off her husband.Oh, this could be such Lifetime material looking just at the plain synopsis. But it's the ingredients that count, what the actors, director and writer do that make it a unique blend that, actually, has some genuine pathos to it. Henry, coming at the material in a slightly similar way to that he had with The Graduate, makes these characters flawed, even quite unlikeable, but they're also painfully human. Suzanne may be a control freak and just possibly as stupid in her own right as the teens she gets in her 'documentary' she's yet to finish. One of them, played by a young Joaquin Phoenix, falls genuinely in love with her, and he's perhaps the ultimate victim (not to mention the husband, played by Matt Dillon as a kind if ineffectual and, contrary to what Suzanne wants, painfully average Italian-American guy). She's like a perky spider who can reel in anyone she wants, and they won't be able to leave her web. Some of them wouldn't want to, like Lydia, who just wants a friend.To Die For is a blistering comedy, shot with a pseudo-documentary feel where from the start (like Fosse's Star 80) we know that a murder has occurred, and her family, ex-in-laws, and ex-friends and co-workers talk about what she was like, how things were. It's a comedy of attitude and mores, and of a certain frame of mind. I felt uncomfortable laughing during some scenes with Suzanne, as she's certainly a disturbed woman, but it's Kidman's ironic perkiness, that is suffused with a genuine quality about her. This pervades the rest of the cast, and potential caricatures (the Italian family with Hedaya, the wasted teenagers played by Affleck and Phoenix) are given some life and depth, in part because of the structure of the documentary. We also get some really knock-out supporting work from Ileana Douglas, Phoenix (especially him), and subtler but no less impressive work from Folland, who we haven't seen in a while in a role as good as this.This is a film with something to say about media attraction and the disease of fame, of the infectious quality of it that, in a way, works even more revelatory as a satire, albeit one based in some facts and truth (I can't say I knew the whole case going in, except that a newswoman really did collaborate with a 15 year old she was sleeping with to kill her husband). The style is off-beat and unpredictable, with a real sense of getting the audience to look a certain way at the characters and at settings and form. Perhaps because of its approach of fake-documentary, including those interspersed clips of Suzanne talking to the audience (which, as it turns out, is just into another camcorder by herself), we don't know where it will go as a story.

But director Gus Van Sant, by way of Buck Henry's incisive and daring screenplay, eschews melodrama for a really dark comedy perhaps not too unlike Network, only this time we don't feel sorry for the lead character the way we do here. Suzanne Stone is no Howard Beale. She's an All-American Girl, Waspy, beautiful (stunningly so), and has that look in her eyes that could kill a kitten if it needed to. And she wants to be famous - really famous, since she's on TV. She doesn't want to be a great journalist like a Mike Wallace, but a personality, like Connie Chung (Not Povich, as she points out), and will do anything to get it, which includes recruiting unwitting (and kinda outright spot-on dumb) teenagers into a murder plot to off her husband.Oh, this could be such Lifetime material looking just at the plain synopsis. But it's the ingredients that count, what the actors, director and writer do that make it a unique blend that, actually, has some genuine pathos to it. Henry, coming at the material in a slightly similar way to that he had with The Graduate, makes these characters flawed, even quite unlikeable, but they're also painfully human. Suzanne may be a control freak and just possibly as stupid in her own right as the teens she gets in her 'documentary' she's yet to finish. One of them, played by a young Joaquin Phoenix, falls genuinely in love with her, and he's perhaps the ultimate victim (not to mention the husband, played by Matt Dillon as a kind if ineffectual and, contrary to what Suzanne wants, painfully average Italian-American guy). She's like a perky spider who can reel in anyone she wants, and they won't be able to leave her web. Some of them wouldn't want to, like Lydia, who just wants a friend.To Die For is a blistering comedy, shot with a pseudo-documentary feel where from the start (like Fosse's Star 80) we know that a murder has occurred, and her family, ex-in-laws, and ex-friends and co-workers talk about what she was like, how things were. It's a comedy of attitude and mores, and of a certain frame of mind. I felt uncomfortable laughing during some scenes with Suzanne, as she's certainly a disturbed woman, but it's Kidman's ironic perkiness, that is suffused with a genuine quality about her. This pervades the rest of the cast, and potential caricatures (the Italian family with Hedaya, the wasted teenagers played by Affleck and Phoenix) are given some life and depth, in part because of the structure of the documentary. We also get some really knock-out supporting work from Ileana Douglas, Phoenix (especially him), and subtler but no less impressive work from Folland, who we haven't seen in a while in a role as good as this.This is a film with something to say about media attraction and the disease of fame, of the infectious quality of it that, in a way, works even more revelatory as a satire, albeit one based in some facts and truth (I can't say I knew the whole case going in, except that a newswoman really did collaborate with a 15 year old she was sleeping with to kill her husband). The style is off-beat and unpredictable, with a real sense of getting the audience to look a certain way at the characters and at settings and form. Perhaps because of its approach of fake-documentary, including those interspersed clips of Suzanne talking to the audience (which, as it turns out, is just into another camcorder by herself), we don't know where it will go as a story.

But it works! Even if you find Dietrich wooden as an actress, you have to appreciate her aura, which was legendary, and which Hitchcock incorporates, and bounces against, with real virtuosity. There are two or three long scenes, as when Dietrich is trying on her mourning clothes and smoking under her veil, where the filming, the fast dialog, the light, the movement of the characters, and the editing are breathtaking.Taken in pieces like this, or seen as a whole, the film is a masterpiece of directing and construction. And at least three of the principle characters are just perfect--Jane Wyman as the innocent woman in the middle of it all, Alastair Sims as her father, and Dietrich. A fourth surprise performance is by Michael Wilding, who appears in many different scenes, and is charming, funny, and smart as a whip, playing a detective in love and in the dark. The plot itself is classic Hitchcock, with seeming innocence and guilt shifting as you watch, and ordinary people getting too involved in the solving of the crime. Including the viewer. Even the use of the flashback that anchors the beginning of the film as two of them speed away gets a huge twist by the end, both a narrative thrill and a logical one, in terms of film-making. Talk about verisimilitude getting in the way of realism.We know that the stage will play a large role throughout, and Hitchcock loved to include the theatre in his films. Christian Dior designed Dietrich's wardrobes, and the song is by none other than Cole Porter. The song is clever, but not his best, and Dietrich's performance, though supported by a fabulous set for a small time theater, is dull. The writing throughout is rather fabulous, partly thanks to Hitchcock's wife, who worked on it (and look for their daughter, by the way, at the lawn party). There is so much going right here, what keeps it from quite becoming a masterpiece? I think the key thing is the startling disparity in acting styles. I mean, Wyman, Sim, and Dietrich are about as odd a threesome as you get in terms of acting style. Wilding is a kind of lubricant throughout (he appears in scenes with all of them and seems to make them sensible). The other noticeable flaw might be the last several minutes, when a climax is building, and yet there is an odd diffusion and a sudden end to it all, as if an opportunity was lost to wring us out a little.But don't let this stand in your way.

Images and sound are combined faultlessly to tell a story that is simultaneously very simple and extremely abstract. Although there are some enormous concepts at the heart of this movie, equally important is how aesthetically and aurally beautiful it all is.The film opens with the epic sound of Richard Strauss's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, which heralds the alignment of the planets in the solar system in a single unbroken line. This unique stellar occurrence signals the first interaction of the mysterious extra-terrestrial beings with the inhabitants of planet Earth. This is the Dawn of Man. The moment at which an alien hand subtly interacts with the primitive life on our planet and sets a seed that will ultimately lead them on the way to technological advancement and through that to an understanding of the universe that will prepare them for the next level of evolution. The way in which these mysterious beings kick-start this human advancement is simplicity itself. They plant a giant black rectangular monolith in their midst. This completely unnatural edifice has a curious effect on the primitive creatures who encounter it. The appearance of the razor sharp lines and perfect symmetry of the dimensions, along with the strange feeling of touching its un-naturally flat surface has an odd effect on these ape-men. It is a trigger. It is the first time these primitive minds have been forced to experience an abstract thought. The very exposure to something so alien and unnatural forces them to start viewing their world in a slightly different way, firstly leading to the use of bones as weaponry. Soon these meek creatures are the masters of their land and on their way to complete dominance of their planet.The natural result of this process is technological advancement and this leap forward is illustrated with one of the most audacious edits in film history when the first man made tool &#x96; a bone &#x96; is inter-cut with an example of a highly complex human construction a spaceship. The point has been made that high-level human technological advancement has resulted as a direct consequence of the first encounter with the mysterious black monolith. At this point it becomes clear that Kubrick is using music very specifically. As we watch the space-transporter float through space and dock with the revolving space-station the music that soundtracks this is Johann Strauss's The Blue Danube. This beautiful, complex piece of classical music indicates aurally the advancement of man too, in terms of high artistic cultural achievement. This is in direct contrast to the avant-garde music that plays whenever the alien presence is felt. This mysterious experimental wall of sound perfectly invokes an alien intelligence. It builds up to a crescendo every time the monolith appears; climaxing unforgettably in the trip through the star-gate. This music simply represents alien interaction.It has to be said at this point too that the design work used for both the exterior and interior of the spacecrafts in 2001 is exemplary and frankly has not aged in the 40 years plus since the film's initial release; a remarkable fact considering the advances in special effects. There is something still undeniably beautiful and fantastic about how the hardware is presented in this film. This leads on to another of the key themes &#x96; what happens when man-made technology becomes so advanced that it starts to develop its own consciousness. When HAL decides to take over the mission to Jupiter in an icily cold and deadly way, this question is posed directly. And the answer is that mankind has to be very careful with technology, as the results could be deadly. In the same way as Man is shaped by the aliens, HAL is created by Man, and, similarly, it has a propensity to murder if the situation requires it.After the man vs. technology segment the film enters its final act. This is the famous star gate sequence where the final surviving astronaut, Dave Bowman, arrives at Jupiter just at the moment that the planets align once again in a straight line. A third black monolith satellite then opens the star gate and Bowman travels through in a visually spectacular sequence. Via this trip Bowman gains an acute understanding of the formation of the universe, the creation of stars and galaxies. He is then transported into a version of our world created by the aliens; in here he quickly grows older and older until he dies and is reborn as the star-child.

Its dramatics are sparse and its pace is slow. But it needs this deliberate pace to accentuate its scope. It makes you feel the vastness and loneliness of space and the mysteries it conceals. And it openly invites you to immerse yourself in the beauty of it all. It's a crowning achievement in showing what cinema can be as a pure art-form. This is certainly not a film for everyone, its themes are so big that it lacks the human touch that some may feel is important. For me this is not a concern as by immersing myself in this film I am able to truly feel the mysterious nature of our solar system and the universe in general, and as well as being a visual tour-de-force, it always leaves me with questions and not just answers.

Soon these meek creatures are the masters of their land and on their way to complete dominance of their planet.The natural result of this process is technological advancement and this leap forward is illustrated with one of the most audacious edits in film history when the first man made tool &#x96; a bone &#x96; is inter-cut with an example of a highly complex human construction a spaceship. The point has been made that high-level human technological advancement has resulted as a direct consequence of the first encounter with the mysterious black monolith. At this point it becomes clear that Kubrick is using music very specifically. As we watch the space-transporter float through space and dock with the revolving space-station the music that soundtracks this is Johann Strauss's The Blue Danube. This beautiful, complex piece of classical music indicates aurally the advancement of man too, in terms of high artistic cultural achievement. This is in direct contrast to the avant-garde music that plays whenever the alien presence is felt. This mysterious experimental wall of sound perfectly invokes an alien intelligence. It builds up to a crescendo every time the monolith appears; climaxing unforgettably in the trip through the star-gate. This music simply represents alien interaction.It has to be said at this point too that the design work used for both the exterior and interior of the spacecrafts in 2001 is exemplary and frankly has not aged in the 40 years plus since the film's initial release; a remarkable fact considering the advances in special effects. There is something still undeniably beautiful and fantastic about how the hardware is presented in this film. This leads on to another of the key themes &#x96; what happens when man-made technology becomes so advanced that it starts to develop its own consciousness. When HAL decides to take over the mission to Jupiter in an icily cold and deadly way, this question is posed directly. And the answer is that mankind has to be very careful with technology, as the results could be deadly. In the same way as Man is shaped by the aliens, HAL is created by Man, and, similarly, it has a propensity to murder if the situation requires it.After the man vs. technology segment the film enters its final act. This is the famous star gate sequence where the final surviving astronaut, Dave Bowman, arrives at Jupiter just at the moment that the planets align once again in a straight line. A third black monolith satellite then opens the star gate and Bowman travels through in a visually spectacular sequence. Via this trip Bowman gains an acute understanding of the formation of the universe, the creation of stars and galaxies. He is then transported into a version of our world created by the aliens; in here he quickly grows older and older until he dies and is reborn as the star-child. Through him man has been taken to the next level of existence.2001 A Space Odyssey is a masterpiece of cinema. It is one of the very few films that can claim to be pure science fiction. Its dramatics are sparse and its pace is slow. But it needs this deliberate pace to accentuate its scope. It makes you feel the vastness and loneliness of space and the mysteries it conceals. And it openly invites you to immerse yourself in the beauty of it all. It's a crowning achievement in showing what cinema can be as a pure art-form. This is certainly not a film for everyone, its themes are so big that it lacks the human touch that some may feel is important. For me this is not a concern as by immersing myself in this film I am able to truly feel the mysterious nature of our solar system and the universe in general, and as well as being a visual tour-de-force, it always leaves me with questions and not just answers. And I like that. ","genre":"Mystery, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"29 March 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The 1960 hit psycho is truly a classic. I must have first view it when I was 10. When I saw it when I was young it creepy me right out. Now viewing again I wasn't crept out as much but I really got to appreciate the way in which the film is done. I'm a fan of a few of Alfred Hitchcock films. The lighting is amazing. Very light and crystal clear. The film has a straight forward plot structure. The film draws you in. It keeps you interested. First you are following the plot of a lady who has stolen money and on the run. Then she gets killed and you completely forget about her, now you are forces on this creepy hotel and weird owner. The first murder scene is done so well. The woman is in the shower she doesn't notice but the audiences can her, Norman's mother's shadow. You don't see the mothers face but you see her stab. You never see the knife actual stab the girl. This scene I felt was tastefully done. You know that girls gets stab by Normans mother not by seeing her pierce the skin but by the motion of the knife that is shown and the girls lifeless body in a pool of blood. I love how the camera tied the nest scene in by going to the shower drain. Then moves out slowly from her eye, then to the unknown hidden money to a shocked Norman cleaning up his mother's murder. Though the movie you develop pity for poor Norman. He is a kind genuine man. You think he would never hurt a fly. His seems nice and charming a little bit on the weird side. He stuff birds but makes it weird is how much he enjoys it. You feel bad for him because it seems he is trapped by his mother. That she has turned him into a mama's boy. At the end you're in for a crazy twist. Though out the movie the suspense builds up, you can wait to see this bitch. But then you are surprise when you see the mother and who she really is. I never would have guess. I thought that the film was brilliantly done. How the mothers face in never relived till the end. Or why you could only her mother when she is having a conversation with her son when you don't see them. But in the end you understand why and how the film got its name. The end makes so much sense when you re watch the film knowing the ending.

He might find some luck, he might not, I don't really care. He's way too whiny to like, and the many occasions on which he talks directly to the camera are downright cringe-inducing. Allison married Kevin! I don't care dude. Leave me alone. Another thing that bothers me here is the unstoppable avalanche of pop culture references. Pretty much every band the writers like is mentioned in this movie, which comes of as pompous in a hey, check out the obscure stuff we know kind of way. They try their best at clever dialogue, but then bail on that and figure they can just play some Beta Band music.

So is Amadeus. The film has such a grandiose scale that it is surprising to find that director Milos Forman has time to bring out the subtle nuances in the story. It's not quite perfect, and maybe a tad long (at least the director's cut is), but Amadeus is a wonderful film.Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), a pious composer with minimal talent, is a huge fan of the hottest thing in 18th century music Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Salieri loves the music, and is eager to meet the new genius...that is, until he meets him. Meeting Mozart is the ultimate slap in the face. Mozart is like the modern day celebrity stereotype a hard partying, hard drinking, conceited jerk who chases anything in a dress. Salieri is so enraged that a man like this was blessed with so much talent, while he, a man who is making music for God, has so little. So Salieri begins orchestrating Mozart's downfall...This is not a true story, and it wisely never claims to be. Playwright Peter Schaffer took a rumor whose credibility is, at best, tenuous, and created a whole new story with characters that indeed lived. The filmmakers have taken the mantra, never let the facts get in the way of a good story to heart.The film is splendidly acted. F. Murray Abraham is nothing short of brilliant as the tortured Salieri. Here is a man who has given everything to write music in praise of God, only to have the promised talent go to a man who is so spoiled and crude. That would drive anyone mad. For his part, Tom Hulce makes a cartoonish character into a surprisingly three-dimensional individual, to the point where he becomes...dare I say it? Sympathetic. Elizabeth Berridge is also good as Constanze, Mozart's wife. She loves her husband, although she has a greater intuition about who his friends and enemies are. Jeffrey Jones is surprisingly good as Emperor Joseph II, the idiot king of Austria (he criticizes one of Mozart's operas for having too many notes).Director Milos Forman is a terrific director. I liked One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, and based on this, I'm going to forgive him for Goya's Ghosts. Forman has an eye for period detail, and we are fully transported back into the time of Mozart. It's not just how everything looks, but how people act. Sitting in chairs in the opera house, fire swallowers on the streets, etc. The only flaw is that Mozart's madness is told, but why it happens is not adequately explained.Amadeus is a wonderful film, plain and simple.My rating PG for brief nudity.
