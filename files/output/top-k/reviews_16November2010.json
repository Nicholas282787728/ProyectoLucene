I don't mean that in any derogatory sense, but whatever buttons it presses rather pass us guys by. It is something of a mish-mash, redeemed, in part, by rather good and definitely entertaining performances from Bette Midler, as the abandoned wife of a Jewish merchant, and Goldie Hawn, an ageing Oscar-winning film start, who has also been abandoned by her film producer husband. Making up the threesome is Diane Keaton (who is never my favourite actress, I'm sorry to say) as the doormat wife of an philandering adman. The trio is brought together by the suicide of the fourth member of their college group, the abandoned wife of a wealthy Wall Street money-man, who hurls herself to her death from the balcony of her Central Park apartment. The trio she leaves behind had all promised to stick together through thick and thin on their graduation day, but in the event had lost touch. Meeting up again after all those years at their friend's funeral, they get roaring drunk afterwards 'catching up', with Hawn and Midler admitting they have been traded in by their husbands for younger model and Keaton, still in denial and insisting she and her husband are only temporarily separated, obviously soon to be in the same boat. One thing leads to another, and the trio decide to form a First Wives Club in order to get revenge on the husband's who discarded them. And so on. The story itself isn't really important it could be a roaring success in some director's hands and a dire disaster in those of another. That's the thin with films derived from books they are entities in themselves. They are not a silver screen realisation of some novel or other. There have been many poor films based on cracking novels (and even works of non-fiction). And there have been great films based on very poor material (and films which consciously set out to be a faithful 'film of the book' tend to be pretty poor). In the hands of director Hugh Wilson and based on Olivia Goldsmith's novel, this is no great shakes, though it has to be said that a pretty average film is shot through with several gems &#x96; great scenes, great acting and great one-liners &#x96; from Midler and Hawn. But overall, as I suggest, this is one for the sisterhood. Given its soul and 'message' (yes, I'm afraid there does seem to be a message of some kind, although one pronounced in such a half-hearted fashion, I do wonder why they even bothered), the sisters might well love it. There are curious elements which add absolutely nothing to the film but makes sense if this is, as I suspect it was intended to be, some kind of sanitised sisterhood tract. Why make Diane Keaton's daughter a lesbian? There is no reason not to, of course, and I have many gay and lesbian friends and colleagues. But what was the purpose of having this lesbian character in the film. It seems purely grafted on to no effect. Then there is the character of Keaton's character's mother what purpose does she have in the film? Beats me. The inclusion of Maggie Smith as the queen bee of New York society (with a very dodgy American accent even to my Brit ears) seems more like an attempt to attract the punters and gain a little spurious 'class' for the film. She plays hardly any part in the film, except as a cackhanded plot device, and even that might have been achieved with a small re-write. Me, I'll remember the good bits involving Midler and Hawn, but I wouldn't have been heartbroken had I fished another £3 DVD out of my supermarket bargain bin rather than this one and never seen it.

I knew I needed to see them because I'm a huge fan of Mel Gibson(Gallipoli, Braveheart, and Lethal Weapon 1 especially), but I suppose it just doesn't appeal to me. Now I will admit that The Road Warrior was a fine enough action film with a high octane chase scene I sure won't forget anytime soon, but the rest just didn't catch my attention. Likewise, the original Mad Max had a similarly memorable chase scene(though not quite as good) and some interesting ideas(certainly the sets and backgrounds were better in that film at least to me personally) and story elements, but still didn't quite do it for me. Though I would still probably give a fair 7\/10 for both(though the first one was a bit better).So you may ask, why even bother reviewing it then? Because, from my point of view, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is a disappointment to even someone like myself. Why? How? Read on folks, read on.In the beginning I mentioned how relatively speaking, this film is simply average. And by that I mean, if you come into this film wanting action, thrills, and a few laughs you'll get them, but all rather routinely and without the drive and energy the previous films had(basically the strongest points of them). But it's below average because of how the rest of the film basically insults the audience's intelligence as well as just overall being painfully inconsistent with the rest of the series.But first I should probably mention the few strong points in the film 1. First of all, the opening section is interesting, when we first get a view of Battertown(the place in which the film takes place) we are intrigued. 2. The early scenes between Mel Gibson and Tina Turner, which contains cliché, but well delivered dialogue, and a nice fight scene between Gibson and some of the guards. 3. The great, and famous thunderdome fight which is inventive, clever, and exciting. 4. The ending monologue, which has some fantastic visuals, and the words spoken are interesting.I suppose one could count the obligatory final chase scene, but it just struck me as a watered down version of The Road Warrior's chase scene.Now onto the obviously bad, WHAT IS UP WITH THOSE KIDS!!! Now I realize that George Miller was probably trying to broaden the popularity and appeal of the series given the unexpected success of The Road Warrior in America, but he could have done that without throwing something as far left as kids asking Max to help them find Tomorrow Morrow Land!? They drag the story down, and also have no character development or purpose(so we never feel anything for the characters), so in the end it was just them borrowing the Ewoks idea Throw in something cute, and you'll make more money.But also, it's just kind of annoying. It's all second rate stuff. The acting is hardly there a lot of the time, the costumes and sets could have been cool but just come across ugly and unpleasant, and the action scenes are tame and more importantly mind numbing.There's little else to say. It's a very unpleasant film to watch, annoying, treats it's audience like they're all idiots who'll just gobble up whatever is thrown at them, and lacks anything that can't be found done in other movies better.

Thelma, the more timid of the two, does not ask her husband, knowing he has a short fuse. But they head out just the same. At a road stop, Thelma is almost raped in the parking lot by some guy from inside the bar. Louise steps in, with the pistol neither has used..but which they brought along for protection...and stops the rapist. They try to go on their way, but the rapist mouths off with profanities and insults galore. Louise gets ticked, and shoots and kills the would-be rapist...and they make their escape. The rest of the film deals with how they handle themselves in the face of adversity. Their belief is that they can't get any fair treatment or justice, and they were probably right to some extent. But, afterall, the guy would have raped Thelma if Louise had not intervened. But now, Thelma and Louise are wanted criminals on the run, and the action escalates to the point where they no longer resemble the simple people they were at the beginning of this story. In a way, the story takes on an anti-male tone but, to their credit, their actions are taken mostly against those guys who have exhibited some real cave-man type of behavior. Soon, Thelma and Louise are committing crimes as a matter of survival...and not just simple solicitation, either. It was an interesting watch, because of the sympathetic portrayal of two ordinary people who just got in over their heads. And after they had passed a certain point, it was simply too late to turn back...to their way of thinking. This is a surprisingly good film, and how Sarandon and Davis both lost out on the Academy Awards to--of all people--Jodie Foster ,is a mystery that stupify Sherlock Holmes. One more thing, Harvey Keitel is woefully miscast as a southern police detective. He cannot shed his Brooklyn accent or New York attitude, and he just does not come off as believable in this vehicle. This may be the worst performance--or the worst casting--for Keitel that I have seen. He is otherwise very good in the roles that he plays. Other than that, this is an OK film and it merits a watch.

Thelma and Louise are two ordinary types...one a housebound wife, the other a worldy-wise restaurant waitress. They decide to make a get-away for the week-end. Thelma, the more timid of the two, does not ask her husband, knowing he has a short fuse. But they head out just the same. At a road stop, Thelma is almost raped in the parking lot by some guy from inside the bar. Louise steps in, with the pistol neither has used..but which they brought along for protection...and stops the rapist. They try to go on their way, but the rapist mouths off with profanities and insults galore. Louise gets ticked, and shoots and kills the would-be rapist...and they make their escape. The rest of the film deals with how they handle themselves in the face of adversity. Their belief is that they can't get any fair treatment or justice, and they were probably right to some extent. But, afterall, the guy would have raped Thelma if Louise had not intervened. But now, Thelma and Louise are wanted criminals on the run, and the action escalates to the point where they no longer resemble the simple people they were at the beginning of this story. In a way, the story takes on an anti-male tone but, to their credit, their actions are taken mostly against those guys who have exhibited some real cave-man type of behavior.

But do not be deceived by the precious delicacy - like a fine music box - of the film. Ernst Lubitsch knew the risks lovers ran. You can feel his crossed fingers. This may be Hollywood's most poignant love story, set amid the fussy, heightened naturalism of a little shop where everyone is a character. At work, Alfred and Klara do not get on, no matter that they are James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan. They are vexed by misunderstandings and cross-purposes. But they share one thing they are both writing heartfelt letters to an unknown correspondent, and through this epistolary communion they have fallen in love. Of course, a moment of discovery will come, and the great Felix Bressart makes it as tense as some moments in Hitchcock films. American film has no more heartbreaking shot than that of Sullavan's face gazing into her empty letter-box. Lubitsch had come so far - from German costume dramas and romantic comedies to Hollywood and Paramount, where he was put in charge of production. He enjoyed considerable acclaim for his silent pictures, including Lady Windermere's Fan (1925), and in the 1930s, with the advent of sound, created a further series of successes - The Smiling Lieutenant (1931), Trouble In Paradise (1932), Design For Living (1933), The Merry Widow (1934), Angel (1937), and Ninotchka (1939). He was a master of sophisticated comedy, whose light touch inspired people like Billy Wilder, who really got his break writing scripts for Lubitsch. The Shop Around The Corner is something of a departure for the director in that its characters are poor and hard-working, and also because the film relies on the ambiance of the shop. It is also the picture in which Lubitsch himself seems most moved and anxious for his lovers. It's a grave and lovely film, as well as a secure masterpiece. In 1940 the US was not yet at war, and Hungary was still free from the worst Nazi domination, but the idea of Christmas at Matuschek's was already far-fetched.

And the strength of the film very much lies in it's frank look at marital problems and how NOT to solve them.It is an emotionally draining film as another reviewer said in the sense, that as this one night evolves, we hear some conversations that are so life like in their strangeness and off beat construction, that we might have preferred not to have heard, but it really does show us something about people and relationships(romantic or otherwise) that we might not have initially faced otherwise. Certainly a lot of that credit goes to playwright Edward Albee and screenwriter Ernest Lehman, who deserve all the money they've made off this movie.Everyone knows the story here, so I won't cover it too much, but for those few who don't, I'll just say it's unforgettable. Throughout the movie, Martha and George(Taylor, and Burton) split up to have discussions sometimes between each other, sometimes with the young couple who has visited(Honey and Nick, played by Sandy Dennis and George Segal respectively), in what leads to some the strongest manipulation between a married couple in a movie you'll ever see. It's strange, but the movie oddly enough also works effectively as a psychological thriller. The odds and ends of these characters unravel in an incredibly suspenseful and intriguing way that is unforgettable.But most of all, the acting is what makes this movie work. Richard Burton especially is hypnotic in his obsessive devotion to whatever pops into his mind, and he has a few speeches in here that he performs so well, it's a shame he didn't win an Oscar for it.

Admittedly, the young couple aren't as big a part of the movie, but nevertheless perform well and are still interesting characters.So if you haven't already seen it, check it out.

Kevin McCallister (Culkin) is left alone again, but this time he gets on the wrong plane which is headed to one of the coolest but is also one of most dangerous cities in America New York City. As Kevin realizes he is parted from his family again--carrying his dad's wallet as he was looking for batteries for his tape recording device which caused him to get on the wrong flight as he was following a businessman who was wearing the identical coat to his dad's. In a similar fashion to the first film, he spends quite a luxurious (and somewhat of mischievous) vacation as he tours around New York, checks into the Plaza Hotel using his dad's credit card, and even has a hotel-chaffered limo take him to a giant toy store (like any ten year old's ideal dream of a vacation).

Despite the unbelievable actions of a ten-year old kid who checks into a fancy hotel, fights off burglars, and scares away the hotel concierge using a gangster film (fast-forwarding the other character's dialog), I still thought that was well done and imaginable for a witty kid like Kevin. Like the first film, it had the moral lesson of not judging people by looks, the importance of family, and the overall gags and jokes that were even better as Kevin is two years older in this film. I would say this film was even better than the first, a staple Christmas classic.

Everyone in the film is called upon to make a moral choice that reflects who and what they are. And choosing has a price. Sheriff Olmstead played masterfully by R. Lee Ermey--once observes that He--FBI agent Frank La Crosse--told the truth, and once you tell the truth, everything else is just cheap whiskey. Olmstead's observation pretty much sums up the film. Virtue is good whiskey. Laughably, Ermey delivers this line spot on with a bottle of Jim Beam--definitely not good whiskey--in the background. Olmsteads's integrity costs him the sheriff's election. His elective replacement, Chief McGinnis, played by William Fichtner, initially comes across as a pompous ass but even he makes a virtuous choice that eventually costs him. Jared Leto who plays Lane Dixon, a burned out physician who strangely bonds with the killer, is another case of self-discovery through moral agency. Even Bob Goodall--a.k.a Danny Glover--the clearly insane serial killer, has a kind of warped integrity. Twisted, yes; but true to his twistedness. FBI agent La Crosse's observation that the killer, Bob Goodall--the name is hardly accidental--may be a murderer but is not a liar simply underscores the film's larger Stoic themes. As Epictetus put it Be one man, bad or good. This film, written and directed by Jeb Stuart should have received more critical attention. It is a thoughtful and philosophically reflective film that paid a price for its quirky moral subtext and integrity it flopped at the box office. Philosophical films, even subdued ones, are generally not money makers--even with decent writing such as this and a popular genre that should have been an appropriate vehicle for its message. However, even for an unreflective viewer this is an entertaining film directed and written by the same guy--Jeb Stuart--who wrote the screenplays for Die Hard and The Fugitive.

The movie is not just a who did it kind of crime movie, but a lot more. In the typical Hitchcock fashion, you will be constantly with a question mark above your head, trying to connect the dots before the end of the movie, however unlike most Hitchcock movies this is more lighthearted and funny. Honestly I expected some funny quotes but not something SO funny, which was a pleasant surprise. Finally there is an E-X-C-E-L-L-E-N-T chemistry between the main characters of the movie that made even me, a guy that slightly hates romance in films, (especially of that era), to love the romantic aura that surrounds Lockwood and Redgrave, maybe because it wasn't forced or fake.You'll hate The Lady Vanishes if If you want something more action packed, fast paced or if you're looking for a movie of the same genre but a lot more dark than this. It's a Hitchcock mystery movie, what did you expect? Rambo??? It takes a bit of time for the main plot to start going in this film&#x85; in fact if I wasn't aware of what the movie was all about I would be like What the hell am I watching???. The Lady Vanishes might be a bit to funny and lighthearted for some so if you are looking something more noir and dark themed look elsewhere. A final flow I can find about the movie is that it gives away some things about the plot. Usually Hitchcock makes you suspicious with EVERYBODY in his films, but here you will probably guess who the good\bad guys are pretty soon.FINAL VERDICT Mystery + Comedy + Romance = Great Movie (7.7\/10)+ Great mystery movie with great plot and execution. Great main cast. Seamless blend of Mystery, Comedy and Romance.- Slow paced. Not for people that wanted something darker. Gives away some clues too soon.Also Check Clue (1985) &#x96; Murder By Death (1976) - Rear Window (1954) &#x96; The Pink Panther (1963)P.S. My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say I like\\don't like this movie but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...

Finally there is an E-X-C-E-L-L-E-N-T chemistry between the main characters of the movie that made even me, a guy that slightly hates romance in films, (especially of that era), to love the romantic aura that surrounds Lockwood and Redgrave, maybe because it wasn't forced or fake.You'll hate The Lady Vanishes if If you want something more action packed, fast paced or if you're looking for a movie of the same genre but a lot more dark than this. It's a Hitchcock mystery movie, what did you expect? Rambo??? It takes a bit of time for the main plot to start going in this film&#x85; in fact if I wasn't aware of what the movie was all about I would be like What the hell am I watching???. The Lady Vanishes might be a bit to funny and lighthearted for some so if you are looking something more noir and dark themed look elsewhere. A final flow I can find about the movie is that it gives away some things about the plot. Usually Hitchcock makes you suspicious with EVERYBODY in his films, but here you will probably guess who the good\bad guys are pretty soon.FINAL VERDICT Mystery + Comedy + Romance = Great Movie (7.7\/10)+ Great mystery movie with great plot and execution. Great main cast. Seamless blend of Mystery, Comedy and Romance.- Slow paced. Not for people that wanted something darker. Gives away some clues too soon.Also Check Clue (1985) &#x96; Murder By Death (1976) - Rear Window (1954) &#x96; The Pink Panther (1963)P.S.

Whenever I say this to someone I'm often barraged by a flurry of What?! How!? Why?! But it's not even scary! Rosemary's Baby is not a horror film! There's like barely any blood! The movie doesn't even have an on-screen death! (If there's one thing I've learned over the years, it's that Hell hath no fury like a contradicted, overly invested genre-lover.)Rosemary's Baby was not just a jolt to the horror genre upon its initial release, but it permeated popular culture in a way not seen since Psycho eight years earlier. Based on the 1967 Ira Levin novel of the same name, Rosemary's Baby is an almost verbatim recreation of its source text. Ira Levin was also the man behind The Stepford Wives and The Boys from Brazil, so something tells me Mr. Levin had a thing for conspiracy theories.In Rosemary's Baby the conspiracy's ringleader is supposedly none other than Satan himself, out to plant his anti-Christ seed into a ripe field, i.e. the as-of-yet-unused womb of some docile, domestic, husband-trusting, innocent-enough, almost ex-Catholic girl. Rosemary Woodhouse is the lady in question. Her husband, Guy, may or may not have sold her drugged-up body one night to the maybe-Satanic Castevets, the neighbors with whom the Woodhouse's share a wall, in order for her to be raped by the Devil and become a vessel for said demon seed (or was Rosemary just having a bad dream that night?) You see, Guy's a struggling actor, so you know he'd sell his soul in a heartbeat for success, so what's his wife's womb to him, right? After all, Guy is getting pretty chummy with those nosy, old, childless Castevets. Their chanting and flute-playing coming from next door, their nomadic, theatrical background, and those scathing remarks against the Pope &#x96; something just isn't right with the Castevets.Rosemary soon finds herself pregnant (but with whose baby?), cut-off from her young friends (associating only with the Castevets and their sect of elders), and getting rather unorthodox Ob-Gyn treatment from a Dr. Abraham Sapirstein (raw egg & fresh herb smoothies constitute Rosemary's diet under his care, also something called Tanas Root&#x85;hmmm, what's THAT an anagram for I wonder?) Her first trimester is nothing but pain, weight loss, anemia, vomiting, and a fondness for raw liver (yuck!) And those who come in contact with her from outside 'the group' often meet bad ends. Poor Rosemary. Is there a plot against her baby? Or is it all being done FOR the baby?With every viewing (and there have been scores of them), I see a little more, hear a little more, and understand a little more &#x96; continually revealing itself and affecting me anew like any great work of art should. I guess one could call Rosemary's Baby the horror movie that keeps on giving. All the acting is excellent too, especially, of course, the Oscar-winning performance by Ruth Gordon as the meddlesome minion of Satan, Minnie Castevet. Even Mia Farrow, whom I normally don't equate with great acting, except Broadway Danny Rose, actually holds her own in scenes with the indomitable John Cassavetes. Her finest moment in the film, if not in her whole career, is arguably the phone booth scene.Rosemary's Baby is an extraordinary picture in that it conveys so much information, it illustrates so much of its motive, and makes privy its truths long before Rosemary knows them herself, but yet somehow it can fill a viewer with constant and complete suspense. And Rosemary's predicament isn't exactly something new in the realm of storytelling; in fact it's formulaic in many ways. When you go into a film knowing it's supposed to be horrific, but are not given any strong shocks or scares for almost the first hour &#x96; that alone creates tension to me. But it is this particular fact about Rosemary's Baby that makes many question its 'horror movie' standing.So what makes a horror movie then? Is it any film whose plot attempts to elicit fright, fear or terror from its audience? Or does a horror film just need to have actual scares &#x96; something that'll make you jump in your seat, or at least make you squirmy? Does a horror movie have to be a symphony of blood, gore, constant score, and speed-of-light editing these days, a 'gruesical' if you will? Has genre, if not the entire definition of what makes a good movie, been kidnapped by technique? Less than three second shot lengths are the mean for a horror film today. Faster and faster pacing. Build-up. Viscera! The visceral. Splatter! Build-up. Gore! Build-up. Murder! Build-up. Big Splatter! Conclusion. One more scare! Lights up. Yawn.The time when Rosemary's Baby is seen as a genuine horror movie might be dead, but is that our loss? Yes. Most often, I hear Rosemary's Baby referred to as not a horror film, but rather a suspense film, and that any horror it may contain is strictly psychological, and therefore not truly scary. All I know is that Poe, Henry James, Lovecraft, de Maupassant, and Jacques Tourneur are the real forefathers of Rosemary's Baby, not Universal Monsters, Hammer Horror's bat-bitten boobies, Corman's explicitness or H.G. Lewis' gore. I believe what has come to be called psychological-horror, is in fact the purest form of horror - a majority of violence, blood, gore, and brutality does not a horror movie make.The autonomy created by city living transformed into a nightmarish, hell-on-earth conspiracy scenario is as relevant today as 1968, if not more so. The daily questioning of one's sanity. To find yourself constantly analyzing the motivations of others. Suspicion towards a loved one. To feel completely isolated and alone, yet surrounded by millions.

At the end Hitchcock beautifully and i cannot stress enough on the word beautifully, together to give a master piece.I don't think any other director can make a movie thats so entertaining and engaging when you know who is the murderer. I just realized that in-spite of having known all the facts in the movie, it still is heavily engaging. You know who the culprit and still Hitchcock keeps you engrossed till the end. This is a lesson to all those suckers who crave for twists in every goddamn thriller movie.Hail HItchcock10\/10 ","genre":"Crime, Film-Noir, Thriller"},{"date":"16 November 2010","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Absolutely Riveting stuff .IT keeps you hanged till the last minute.I was totally absorbed into it. Hitchcock proves again that he is indeed the master of suspense. No one can match him in storytelling even today. I loved it as much as Vertigo.

Many times the most simple things are the best. Simplicity is often the right road to go far.François Truffaut must have directed this film with all his dedication, heart and soul. It's realistic, touching, sensitive and human. It does a very good job in showing the existence's crisis faced by the teenagers, as well as showing how hard life can be in that complex phase of life. It also feels very nostalgic for many reasons, but it would take me forever to number them here. Another thing which this movie triumphs is when it comes to settings by showing us the streets of Paris and many different areas of this city fondly known as the City of Lights. The soundtrack is magnificent, it sounds so sad, so deep, so intense and so beautiful.All in all, a wonderful movie, with very little to be improved. Even its ending is very expressive. There is something inspiring about that ending and it makes me wanna do the same thing. Antoine Doinel runs away to a beach, finally experiencing the sea. He wets his feet, but doesn't take his shoes and socks off. That freezed final shot of him looking at the camera accents the originality and makes it more memorable. I think that if he got into the water and swam (with a freezed final shot either), that would make the ending even more memorable. Jean-Pierre Léaud is wonderful in the role of Antoine Doinel, a normal however troublesome 14-year-old boy. I mean, look at the way he is treated. His teacher hates him. His parents are a disaster together and give little credit to the boy. Can you blame him? But, as I said, the actor is wonderful. You don't see young actors like this anymore this expressive, this natural, this charismatic, this confident in front of the camera, this talented... they're a vanishing breed.Although of dramatic nature, there are elements of comedy in this great film. Certain scenes really make me laugh like few movies do now. Antoine Doinel is often funny and so is his good friend René (brilliantly portrayed by Patrick Auffay). Richard Kanayan is hilarious in every scene he shows up, even though his role is minor and he barely talks. But the things he does, combined with his figure and the actor's charisma and talent, make him hilarious. Guy Decomble is priceless as the impatient and short-tempered but hilarious French teacher, fondly nicknamed 'Petite Feuille' by his pupils.Just about all the kids are very good. Claire Maurier and Albert Rémy are interesting choices to play Antoine's parents and they convince.Title in Portugal 'Os 400 Golpes'.
