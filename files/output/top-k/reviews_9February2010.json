The movie is not quit as predictable as one would think. Crawl is an unattractive, but fun and caring and most importantly a very devoted friend. Still, an unlikely match for Rebecca, who has an attractive and seemingly kind boyfriend back home. When he helps feel more at ease at school, by showing her around the neighborhood and encouraging her to socialize more, they become buddies, but it is completely platonic. When she realizes her boyfriend might propose, she does not feel ready, he seems to like her boyfriend, but she seems to be enjoying her free laid back party life at college is not yet ready to live a life of marriage and responsibility. You kind of learn what a good friend Crawl is when he tells her he will help get her out of getting married. When her boyfriend proposes to her, in front of the whole family, she kicks Crawl and puts him on the spot. He tells the whole family that he proposes to her, and gives her his diamond ring, which it tunrs out was his the whole time (he must have come from money or something. Well they never really show a close up of the ring). The message of the movie seemed to be not to judge people by their looks and not to judge people before you get to know him. Rebecca's boyfriend, who her parents love, turned mean when we find out he druged his new girlfriend after Rebecca,(Amber Thesan) and Crawl, so that Rebecca would have broken up with Crawl, thinking they were a couple. Although they were not, Rebecca was mad at him, which when you think about it, was kind of unfair, since they were not a couple, but I think they were starting to like one another. And I think she thought there was more. The movie never showed them actually become a couple, they left it open for the viewers to decide. They never even actually kissed at any point, although there was one part where they almost did. That was one thing most viewers seemed to misunderstand. Many people saw it and said, that he would be a nightmare for fathers to see their daughters bring home or a shock, but they were just friends the whole time, even towards the end. And she did not introduce him as her boyfriend; still they never told her parents they were not engaged. Rebecca almost did. Even if he would never become her boyfriend, they could have still been friends.

This is not a remake of the 1942 version; it has the basic premise of a woman in conflict, but the sexuality is not sublimated and there are no shadows to hide the gory effects. In this movie, the panther is real, and the forbidden fruit was created specifically to be eaten raw.The reversal of the taboo from the 1942 version is a reflection of the year 1982. In 1982, Irena makes love as a woman, then is transformed into a black leopard. To regain her human form, she must kill someone. There is backstory, of course. Paul fills her in on the story (she was adopted and has no idea; she's still a virgin). He has spent his post-pubescence having sex with prostitutes, then killing them to change back to Paul. Paul tells Irena that as fellow cat people, they can have sex with each other without the change taking place - Irena is repulsed, but Paul tells her their parents were brother and sister living as husband and wife. It's either sex with each other or sex and murder. What a difference in movie outlook in forty years.Kinski burns up the screen with her sexuality, and Heard is no slouch, either. As cat people, Paul and Irena have superhuman strength, making impossible leaps to escape when hunted. Director Paul Schrader makes excellent use of their lithe muscularity and grace in the special effects. And he makes the best use of a window frame I've seen, separating two would-be lovers with a riveting view.In 1982, psychology is out and sex is in. Unlike the 1942 original, here there is no sublimation. Irena's refusal to mate with Oliver is not based on Old World superstition and morality. Instead we have the foreshadowing of lethal sex, a year after the discovery of GRID. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Alan Ormsby (writer of this version of Cat People) has not obscured the real issue in the shadows as DeWitt Bodeen did in 1942. Sex (and bodies) are out in the open in 1982. In the 1942 version, Irena's problem was dismissed as superstition, but here the problem is an established fact If Paul and Irena have sexual intercourse, they will turn into panthers until they kill; the exception is mating (as Paul puts it) with each other - in that event, all is well. Paul has accepted this situation and has turned to prostitutes for his gratification, killing them after the sex. Paul has the only line with any compassion in the entire movie Don't make the mistake of having sex with someone you love - let me warn you away from _that_ disaster, he tells Irena.Otherwise the film is devoid of any real human feelings. Oliver loses two friends to death by panther, and he's unfazed by both, curiously dead to their loss. Death is just a way to advance the plot, not a human tragedy to be mourned. Because of the lack of feelings, we feel no chill when Oliver assures Alice he knows what he's doing, although we the audience know he has no clue.Ormsby is incapable of condensing his plot points into a reasonable time and more nearly clear meanings. Oliver and Irena drive a long way out of town, then row a long way to a secluded house occupied by Oliver's friend, for no apparent reason until near the end when we have the aha! moment and realize the friend was needed for the panther to kill. The opening of the movie is a silent sequence that makes no sense at all and takes way too long. Later, Paul and Irena visit that same set again in a dream sequence, and Paul explains what we were shown - without his voice over, we had no clue. Either the first dream sequence should have made sense or it should have been eliminated and only the second dream sequence shown.Taken with the erotic themes and views, Kinski, McDowell, and Heard rise enough above the script to make the film worth watching. An interesting thing I noticed is how much alike McDowell and Kinski looked in the film - not like brother and sister, but _alike_. Paul discloses to Irena that their parents were brother and sister, so there's one reason, but the other is more chilling Paul has sex and kills his partner, and Irena must do the same unless she chooses her brother as her mate. They are _alike_. There was a great deal of potential in Cat People quite apart from the original screenplay, but it is not fully realized. The human component is necessary and missing here. We're left with an erotic thrill but no catharsis over Irena's choice of freedom.

In 1982, Irena makes love as a woman, then is transformed into a black leopard. To regain her human form, she must kill someone. There is backstory, of course. Paul fills her in on the story (she was adopted and has no idea; she's still a virgin). He has spent his post-pubescence having sex with prostitutes, then killing them to change back to Paul. Paul tells Irena that as fellow cat people, they can have sex with each other without the change taking place - Irena is repulsed, but Paul tells her their parents were brother and sister living as husband and wife. It's either sex with each other or sex and murder. What a difference in movie outlook in forty years.Kinski burns up the screen with her sexuality, and Heard is no slouch, either. As cat people, Paul and Irena have superhuman strength, making impossible leaps to escape when hunted. Director Paul Schrader makes excellent use of their lithe muscularity and grace in the special effects. And he makes the best use of a window frame I've seen, separating two would-be lovers with a riveting view.In 1982, psychology is out and sex is in. Unlike the 1942 original, here there is no sublimation. Irena's refusal to mate with Oliver is not based on Old World superstition and morality. Instead we have the foreshadowing of lethal sex, a year after the discovery of GRID. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Alan Ormsby (writer of this version of Cat People) has not obscured the real issue in the shadows as DeWitt Bodeen did in 1942. Sex (and bodies) are out in the open in 1982. In the 1942 version, Irena's problem was dismissed as superstition, but here the problem is an established fact If Paul and Irena have sexual intercourse, they will turn into panthers until they kill; the exception is mating (as Paul puts it) with each other - in that event, all is well. Paul has accepted this situation and has turned to prostitutes for his gratification, killing them after the sex. Paul has the only line with any compassion in the entire movie Don't make the mistake of having sex with someone you love - let me warn you away from _that_ disaster, he tells Irena.Otherwise the film is devoid of any real human feelings. Oliver loses two friends to death by panther, and he's unfazed by both, curiously dead to their loss. Death is just a way to advance the plot, not a human tragedy to be mourned. Because of the lack of feelings, we feel no chill when Oliver assures Alice he knows what he's doing, although we the audience know he has no clue.Ormsby is incapable of condensing his plot points into a reasonable time and more nearly clear meanings. Oliver and Irena drive a long way out of town, then row a long way to a secluded house occupied by Oliver's friend, for no apparent reason until near the end when we have the aha! moment and realize the friend was needed for the panther to kill. The opening of the movie is a silent sequence that makes no sense at all and takes way too long. Later, Paul and Irena visit that same set again in a dream sequence, and Paul explains what we were shown - without his voice over, we had no clue.

An interesting thing I noticed is how much alike McDowell and Kinski looked in the film - not like brother and sister, but _alike_. Paul discloses to Irena that their parents were brother and sister, so there's one reason, but the other is more chilling Paul has sex and kills his partner, and Irena must do the same unless she chooses her brother as her mate. They are _alike_. There was a great deal of potential in Cat People quite apart from the original screenplay, but it is not fully realized. The human component is necessary and missing here.

Although seeming cheap and exploitive on the surface, the film attempts to differentiate itself from the competition by introducing a young girl in Angela (Felissa Rose) to root for, instead of the usual cardboard characters that usually pad out this sort of film.Now granted, there's plenty of bad acting and stereotypes to go around (especially when it comes to the camp counselors) but with credible performances by the younger end of the cast, the film rises above it's somewhat cheap nature. The death scenes are creative and are effectively achieved by some classic POV shots, but unfortunately they occur mostly off-screen and are consequently rendered ineffective. It certainly can't match the suspense of Halloween or the inventiveness of the original Friday the 13th, but writer\/director Robert Hiltzik makes sure you at least have fun while feeling for its main lead, giving the film a bit more soul than the average slasher.What Sleepaway Camp will be remembered for, though, is its twist-ending that is likely to leave your jaw on the floor and beg a repeat viewing. Even though the film hints at it from time to time, it's careful not to completely give it away, and what results is a final image that will haunt you for days and which has been talked about incessantly for the past three decades since its release.

The poor acting (also of his dinner guests, let alone the people in the future) doesn't help either. The idea of finding a time without war is the only idea that somewhat redeems the main character's reasoning.The predictions of the future are obviously driven by the sentiment at the time, so I can't fault it for that, but this original version is full of obvious logical flaws, e.g. the English language being spoken well by everyone, so far into the future.

The film also features some interesting cameos from Richard Pryor, Giovanni Ribisi, and Gary Busey as Pete's father.The film flirts with such ideas as reincarnation and psychogenic fugue. Lost Highway was to be the first of what John David Ebert calls his Los Angeles Trilogy, the second being Mulholland Drive and the third being Inland Empire.

Some may disagree, suggesting many other interpretations, or stating that that idea had been done before. Well, I must say that it has never been done this way. This film was the start of an original and trademark style of Lynch's, the style which would make his films recognizable based merely on the use of camera-work and lighting.With Lost Highway, Lynch reinvented the usual film narrative in a way which put the viewer directly into the driver's seat of a delusional and\/or unstable mind.

Lynch takes refuge on this technique in both Mulholland Drive, and Inland Empire.I don't much listen to what most professional critics have to say about a film because, frankly, they're opinions aren't usually the smartest or well-guided out there. Take any film from Stanley Kubrick, for example.

It's much more fun for a film-goer to discover cult films like Lost Highway, than stick with the same Casablanca-esquire formula you'll find in most critic favorites. And in the words of Robert Blake -- It's been a pleasure talking to you.

All that's left is cable service. After a four hour wait, and while he's in the shower no less, Steven finally gets a visit from cable technician Chip Douglas. Chip is all watts and no volts.

But to him, Steven's request is an invitation into his life. And he suddenly starts stalking Steven, convinced they're the best of friends. And the more Steven tries to push him away, the more Chip tries to take over his life. Even stealing Robin away from him.The Cable Guy tackles a subject really quite dark for a comedy. Stalking. But that leaves the film in an awkward position. How to make a film about stalking funny? Well its very simple. You don't. There is nothing funny about stalkers, so what we have is a comedy looking for laughs in a subject where there's none to be found. Its an unworkable premise.There are quite a few things wrong with The Cable Guy. One problem I had with it is that Steven isn't very sympathetic. When the topic is stalking, we need to sympathise with the victim. But Steven is a bland character. One fails to see what Robin + Chip see in him. Indeed Matthew Broderick looks awkward in a lot of his scenes with Jim Carrey. Probably because he has no clue what to do when you're sharing the screen with an unpredictable lunatic.Certainly since he was getting a 20 million dollar paycheck for the role, Jim Carrey puts everything into it. In some scenes he really pulls out all the stops, like when he manically attacks Jefferson Airplane's Somebody to Love at a karaoke do. In two really sadistic scenes, he takes Steven to his favourite restaurant, Mediaeval Times, and the two do battle with swords, clubs, axes and jousting lances. And then beats up a man trying to chat Robin up in a mens room.I actually found scenes like these more disturbing than funny. And that's largely the problem with The Cable Guy. When it tries to be funny it just comes out weird. When it tries to be sinister, it comes out silly. You'd be hard pressed to find a film more confused. Jim Carrey may have been trying to flex himself as an actor, but its just the same old shtick in the wrong kind of movie.The supporting cast is more interesting. We have quite a few before they became famous names on the credits. Look out for Jack Black, Owen Wilson, and the film is even directed by Ben Stiller. In fact, one wonders what the film might have been like with a bit of recasting. What if Jack Black had played The Cable Guy and Ben Stiller had played Steven? Black can play tightly controlled mania far better then Carrey can. And Stiller is great at playing put upon schmucks bending to pressure. Matthew Broderick just isn't right for Steven. He was a perfect Ferris Bueller, and a great teen hacker in WarGames, but as Steven he's just straitjacketed into the role of an uptight yuppie, with all his cocky charisma bled out of the character.The script feels unfinished. Steven and Jack Black's friendship is vague at best. Why Chip is disturbed is never really explained. We guess its because of a lonely childhood spent in front of the TV. So I think there is supposed to be a hidden message there. How television has saturated its way into society. The numbing effects of television on a person. Steven's doorbell even sounds like a gameshow buzzer.All the people in the film are glued to their sets watching an ongoing court trial. Chip throws himself onto a satellite transmitter, disrupting cable everywhere (one fella decides to read a good book instead), so I think the moral of the film is man triumphs over the effects of television. But that's a muddled message at best. The Cable Guy never really finds a balance between the satire it tries for and the thriller it could (should?) have been. One for die-hard Carrey fans.

Raiders of the Lost Ark, Tootsie and Gandhi can be considered as some of the best films in each of their genre. However, a certain void in the genre of science fiction was visible. With Blade Runner two years away and the Terminator being just a grain of sand in James Cameron's mind, the science fiction genre lacked the definitive film for that year. A film which alone could stand as a proud representative of a subject that can be explore to infinity.General conception would say that the obvious film that filled the void was&#x85; Mad Max 2? Yeah&#x85;that doesn't sound right to me either. You see what I'm trying to explain? Escape from New York hit the perfect release year since it had no real blockbuster threats preventing it from attracting a main stream audience and consequently became one of the cult classics of the genre.But enough about history! Let's get down to the story in 1988 the crime rates in New York City had raised by 400%. This forces the government to turn Manhattan into a prison by building giant walls around the island and keeping the open waters under heavy surveillance by guards. There's only one rule that must be respected when entering the Manhattan prison once you get in, you can never get out. Soon after the prologue, we cut the year 1997. Enter Snake Plissken, a buff commando like Kurt Russell with an eye patch and not a care for the world. Snake has been sentenced to time in Manhattan for the crime of credit card robbery (I know this sounds ridiculous but in the 80's it made total sense). Fortunately, Snake is called upon by the bad..eh&#x85;I mean Lee Van Cleef, the chief of the prison because the presidents plane has crashed in New York and the president (still alive of course) has been captured. If Snake manages to rescue him, his crime is pardoned.Escape from New York is one of the better examples of a show, don't tell movie. The possibilities that the setting of a Manhattan running wild helped Carpenter to write his script using nothing but his own creativity. Although no light sabers are visible in the movie, E.f.N establishes itself as a futuristic movie through the classic use of Orwell's Utopic society. The film does a brilliant job of showing how little differences there are between the power hungry Duke of New York who wants to not only be the ruler of the city but wants the prison to up rise and crush the enemy and the President of the United States, who wants to maintain peace and order at a time of conflict through the use of force and threat.The dialog is short and snappy; leaving a lot of silences for the audience to contemplate the big dark chaos that is New York. The film is not at all ambiguous and as a consequence, manages to convey a great tech-noir style which still up to this day is not only affective but also very cool.This review could go on forever but to make things short, Escape from New York is a film which achieves at everything it goes for and at the same time, remains to be one of the most entertaining and deepest movies of the science fiction genre, constructing as one re-watches the film, a more detailed brain image of its main theme New York as a prison.9 stars out of 10Bloody Brilliant ","genre":null},{"date":"9 February 2010","score":"","review":" In a dark time of cinema history where it seemed that the industry was transcending into a more colorful and happy era rose film legend John Carpenter to re-invent the concept of atmosphere in a movie.

Enter Snake Plissken, a buff commando like Kurt Russell with an eye patch and not a care for the world. Snake has been sentenced to time in Manhattan for the crime of credit card robbery (I know this sounds ridiculous but in the 80's it made total sense). Fortunately, Snake is called upon by the bad..eh&#x85;I mean Lee Van Cleef, the chief of the prison because the presidents plane has crashed in New York and the president (still alive of course) has been captured. If Snake manages to rescue him, his crime is pardoned.Escape from New York is one of the better examples of a show, don't tell movie. The possibilities that the setting of a Manhattan running wild helped Carpenter to write his script using nothing but his own creativity. Although no light sabers are visible in the movie, E.f.N establishes itself as a futuristic movie through the classic use of Orwell's Utopic society. The film does a brilliant job of showing how little differences there are between the power hungry Duke of New York who wants to not only be the ruler of the city but wants the prison to up rise and crush the enemy and the President of the United States, who wants to maintain peace and order at a time of conflict through the use of force and threat.The dialog is short and snappy; leaving a lot of silences for the audience to contemplate the big dark chaos that is New York. The film is not at all ambiguous and as a consequence, manages to convey a great tech-noir style which still up to this day is not only affective but also very cool.This review could go on forever but to make things short, Escape from New York is a film which achieves at everything it goes for and at the same time, remains to be one of the most entertaining and deepest movies of the science fiction genre, constructing as one re-watches the film, a more detailed brain image of its main theme New York as a prison.9 stars out of 10Bloody Brilliant ","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"9 February 2010","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The Official Tagline of the movie is 'From the Man who Made The Best Picture of 1941 '.Mentioning Not only of that year's , but considered as one of the best movies ever - Citizen Kane.

The story is very simple but handled with complexity such that sometimes it tends to shy away from the basic story. My problem with the movie is that it tends to be technically brilliant, great camera-work, great editing, great sets, even great acting, but the heart and soul of a movie - The story is given secondary treatment IMO. Orson Welles who is not only the director but also the narrator of the movie lacked in that aspect. Thus, you do not feel for the characters of the movie, you don't get involved in their emotional turbulence, you just are restricted to praising it's sets, camera-work, costumes and acting. Also, it might be boring for some viewers and may be considered as a substitute for sleeping pills.Acting is a strong aspect of the movie, right from Orson Welles's best friend Joseph Cotten, to a very bright Tim Holt. From a hyper Agnes Moorehead to a restrained and graceful Dolores Costello. I would suggest this movie for viewers who view cinema as an art or who love the different aspects of film-making.

Sherman is left behind during the summer, having to work. But something else starts to occupy his mind, his new upstairs neighbor. It isn't just anyone, but a spectacularly beautiful young woman. A model to boot. Sherman starts flirting with her, but his guilty conscience is having the best of him. Should he or should he not act on the romance with the girl upstairs.Comments A rather unusual story where most of the story is played out in either Sherman's apartment or Sherman's imagination, as he obsesses if he should or shouldn't act on his impulses. But unusual and original as it is, it is not that funny that one could hope for. Legendary screenwriter and director Billy Wilder spearheads this movie and that promises a lot, and it doesn't live up to the expectations. There were a few outright laughs, it mostly made me smile a little. With Sherman's obsessing it almost gets a little brooding instead.It does bear watching though, if nothing else for one famous scene where Marilyn Monroe steps out on the grating above the subway, and her dress blows up around her legs. It's fun to have seen the original seen that has been copied and parodied countless times since.But at almost two hours running, it is not really good enough to really carry itself. Some small moments of good jokes but otherwise it was just rather long. If you want to watch a really funny Marilyn Monroe movie I recommend Some like it hot.

While updated, this film directed wonderfully by the talented Otto Preminger is a wonderful contemporary version of the opera, still maintaining Bizet's wonderful music and inspired lyrics from Oscar Hammerstein II. Whether it is the definitive film version of the opera I am not sure, I absolutely adore the 1984 film with Placido Domingo and Julia Mignes-Johnson. That aside, this film is really handsomely shot, with beautiful crisp cinematography and stunning scenery. And of course the music is outstanding Dat's Love, Dis Flower, Stan' Up an' Fight and Dere's a Cafe on de Corner really do stand out. The story is a beautiful, tragic, compelling one, not at all confusing. And the performances are marvellous, Dorothy Dandridge is superb as Carmen Jones. She is gorgeous, flirtatious and sexy, everything Carmen in the opera should be. Harry Belafonte does a great job as Joe, the man consumed for the passion of Carmen, so much so he is driven to murder. Olga James is heart breaking as Cindy-Lou, Pearl Bailey is a delightful Frankie, Joe Adams is a great Husky Miller and Brock Peters is effective as Sergeant Brown. I have heard complaints that the singing was awful, and I disagree completely. Marilyn Horne has a beautiful singing voice and she did well as Carmen. She has been better though, she has a much stronger voice than what was heard here. And LeeVern Hutcherson has a lovely tenor voice, quite lightweight and sensitive when it needs to be. And Marvin Hayes has a very resonant voice that is needed for his character. If the singing was a little quiet at times, do bear in mind sound and technology wasn't as good then than it is now. My real complaint was that the lip-synching was a little behind the singing at times, but other than that, this is a great film. 9\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"9 February 2010","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" You may guess that I love Bizet's opera Carmen, it is somewhat tragic but very passionate.

The film begins like a bazillion or a thousand years in the future...whatever. The Earth is now a craptastic wasteland filled with either stupid tribal humans or nasty Psychlos. The Psychlos took over the planet long ago and laid waste to it--leaving only tattered remnants of the past such as burned out cities. I won't bore you with needless details of the plot, though I actually was intrigued about a dystopian future where humans are killed for sport or enslaved--even though it did seem an awful lot like the Planet of the Apes films in many ways. And, the idea of these humans eventually rising up against their oppressors also intrigued me.BUT, as I said, this is a bad film. Throughout, the dialog is very lame and I knew something horrible must be in store--after all, critics were unanimous in their hatred of this film. Towards the final 1\/4, what good there was in the film went completely out the window in a plot that made Independence Day seem very plausible. The smart caveman and the rest of his Flintstone-like pals stumble upon the ancient arsenal at Ft. Hood. And, the equipment is in perfect working condition after all these many centuries.

With camera jumping from desert landscapes to jungle terrain to whatever other geographical features anyone could possibly imagine. You know what would make these already impressive sets even better? If a certain Jar Jar character wasn't traipsing across them. I can put up with Little Anakin, at least, because Jake Lloyd isn't in any future films, and He is an integral character. I honestly sometimes wonder whether George Lucas just threw him in there to bug people.So while the film isn't great, it is good for the most part. However, I can't honestly say I enjoyed myself when a certain two who will go unnamed left me debating whether or not to claw out my eardrums.

In that regard this movie is also really a typical Tim Burton movie. It however is also a very early Tim Burton movie. The only major movie that he had done before this one was Pee-wee's Big Adventure. Seems to me that in those early days he was still somewhat searching for the right balance between the visuals, quirkiness and a story. The balance in this movie is at times still a bit off, with makes it a somewhat awkward movie at times.Still I can appreciate Beetle Juice for being the cult-classic that it is. It's certainly a different movie and obviously a very well made one. It's a fun, light-hearted movie, even with all of its heavy subjects that are actually in it. I mean after all, this is a movie about death. But death never looked so colorful and hysterical.The movie knows how not too take itself ever too serious and lots of stuff in the movie and its story simply make no sense. They simply decided not to let it. It's were part of the movie its quirkiness comes from.But of course visuals also play an important role in that. If you have seen a Tim Burton movie before and of course you have, you'll know that his movies are very visually orientated and he has his very own distinctive style. This time the movie is not just partly Gothic looking it's also obviously inspired by German expressionism. Like basically all of his movie, it's a very surreal one but above all also constantly entertaining to watch.Quite amazing to watch these days the actors that are in this movie. None of them were really big names at the time but they soon become after this movie. The most obvious names are Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Winona Ryder and Michael Keaton. I wished the movie had more of Michael Keaton in it as it though, as Beetlejuice. He's one over-the-top going, crazy, fun clown like character that can be hired in the afterlife as a bio-exorcist to scare out the living. But we also really shouldn't forget Jeffrey Jones and Glenn Shadix who both were also really hilarious and perfectly cast in their roles.One of the other things that really adds perfectly to the movie its atmosphere, besides its impressive imaginative visuals, is the musical score by Danny Elfman. Ever since Pee-wee's Big Adventure he has pretty much scored Tim Burton's every work.Even though it is not as smooth as a movie, especially story-wise, it still is an early Tim Burton movie that is worth seeing.7\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"9 February 2010","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Well, to be honest, this movie was better in my memory than it actually turned out to be when I just recently re-watched it again.I really like Tim Burton and than of course especially the style and atmosphere that he always brings to his movies.

Nonetheless, he's directed a number of very intriguing films over the last two decades, though what's rare about him (and perhaps is the reason why his name isn't quite as well known) is that almost no two of his films are alike. Those moviegoers who pay attention (like me) would notice that what connects all his films, from Slacker (1991) and Dazed and Confused (1993) to A Scanner Darkly (2006) and Waking Life (2001), is Linklater's knack for character developing by way of believable and profound dialogue. The words of these characters are not only well-written, but the actors playing them almost never sound as though they are actually acting when speaking them.That's why I was surprised that all of the words spoken by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in Before Sunrise were actually written, and not by the two actors themselves. Hawke and Delpy are not playing themselves, either. Hawke is Jesse, an American tourist in his late 20's who is on a trip across Europe to find himself, if you will. On his way to Vienna, Austria, where he plans to take a plane back to the States the next day, he meets Celine (Delpy), a French student around his age who is on her way back to France on the same train. As Jesse is about to get off in Austria, he persuades Celine to accompany him through Vienna, and they get to know each other as they travel the city, and are well aware it will be their only night together, if not their last for a long time.The chemistry between Hawke and Delpy is incredible, and through very long shots of them talking, you never see them look at cue cards or try any trick to make them remember their lines. I felt as though I was eavesdropping on an actual conversation. Remarkably enough, Linklater and Kim Krizan wrote all their dialogue. There may have been moments of improvisation here and there, but the dialogue evenly flowed throughout the film regardless of the source.A good 90% of the film involved Hawke and Delpy talking, but by no means was the film boring for many reasons. First of all, the city of Vienna, where the film was shot on location, seemed to serve as a third character the same way Chicago did for The Blues Brothers (1980), or Idaho did for Napoleon Dynamite (2004). Somehow the places that Jesse and Celine spontaneously walked to were all interesting despite there being no panoramic shots (except at the end, in a unique montage showing the places where the two characters had gone). Regardless of Linklater's intentions of choosing Vienna as the film's location, the city held its own with its particular attributes that differentiated it from anywhere else in the world, let alone Europe.Second, the main characters were not only likable, but had that undeniable charisma that made their dialogue worth listening to. Each character also revealed enough about their background to keep audiences intrigued, and Linklater was wise not to cut to B-roll footage when these characters were telling their stories. Such a move would have insulted the intelligence of the audience, but other modern directors underestimate the attention spans of their intended audiences unfortunately.Third, throughout the film until its conclusion, I wondered if these characters would actually meet again, and in what circumstances. Of course, that question is officially answered in the sequel that would be released nine years later, Before Sunset. Not taking that film into account, you want these characters to meet again, but you also know that they're making the most of time they know is limited. That level of intrigue is enough to sustain any attention span, and makes for one of the most unique romantic movies ever made (even still).
