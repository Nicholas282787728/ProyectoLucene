Yes, they likely did some DNR (digital noise reduction) since this is one of the earlier Blu-rays, but not detrimentally so. The picture is sharp, clean and very nice looking. For a 2000 film it looks awesome, and the sound is very good too.Now, to the film...I sure don't understand some of these very nasty and negative reviews. This was quite simply a riveting, well made, well acted Crime Thriller. I honestly don't know what more you could want or ask for in a film of this type. One person here said something about MTV and 'Frenetic Editing'...??? WHAT...?! It was exactly the opposite. YES, the film and visual techniques are indeed stylized, but there is absolutely NOTHING 'Frenetic' about it. Watch the 2nd and 3rd 'Bourne' films if you want to see what frenetic editing looks like. There is a total absence of palsy-induced, shaky camera work. The shots are classically structured and edited. The style comes in with some nice colouring effects thrown in HERE AND THERE and I personally REALLY loved the soundtrack. Yes, it is from it's time, but the songs are very effective and there is a nice blend of original scoring too that fits the film quite nicely. Technically, to me anyway, the film is flawless and looked and sounded great (especially on Blu-ray )Whether you like Keanu or not might have a bearing as to how much you like the film. I felt that for the part that he played that he pulled it off nicely and his characterization was perfect. I have always really loved James Spader (platonically ) I think he is the living $h!tz of cool. I've just always really dug the understated and low- key, sardonic slant that he gives his characters. All the other supporting actors \/ actresses did a fine job that also fit in very well with the tone and feel of the film.It is a Classic Serial Killer \/ Police Thriller with great action, excellent pacing, and a nice time-appropriate feel and style. I really liked the director and the way he did the film very much. I was quite surprised to see that he did not go on to make very many more films. For this Genre, I felt that he delivered a very effective movie. It certainly is not just Mindless Action as so many others are. There is a very real soul and believability to the characters and why they do what they do. I think that the mood and overall feel of the film is perfect, with a well suited soundtrack. Oh, without giving anything away, I LOVED the scene at about 37 minutes as the cops gather briefly in the mall to look for the current victim. Truly Classic!I don't know... maybe people are all into the current trend of Dark, moody Noir Thrillers that are coming out now. And, granted, I love those too, I really do. BUT... I guess even though this was made only about 15 years ago, it's look and style might be considered kind of antiquated compared to newer films. That may be true. But, in my lowly and wretched opinion, I feel that that is NO reason to dismiss this highly entertaining and involving Thriller just because it comes from a slightly different era. Some jaded numbnut snobs here glibly state, Full of '90s clichés That just simply is not true. There are a TON of very blah, pointless, and NON-entertaining Crime Thrillers out there, believe me. But, THIS is most definitely NOT one of them...FWIW, here is my take on movies in general. And, I PROMISE not to go on and bore you to death... Simply this No matter WHAT the style, time period, or Genre, a Movie is a Movie. It is either a good movie or a bad movie (or many times something in between) Now, there may be certain TYPES of movies that you just don't like. For example, for me I find no entertainment value in sadistic Torture Porn films. Others may really like them, but I can say that for me personally, categorically I just do not like them. Okay... Some say that the first 'SAW' film was very clever and a new approach to Horror. Fine... I can acknowledge that for that type of film, it is probably one of the best. But, I just don't like those types. So, the same may be true about this film here. Maybe you don't like the more glossy, somewhat stylized Crime Thrillers that were made 15-20 years ago; maybe they just go against your grain and aren't your 'thing'. well, in that case I would say then that it is likely that you may not enjoy this one, unless you really happen to like either or both Keanu Reeves and James Spader.Bottom line... If you happen to like the style of Crime Thrillers made around the this time, it is one of the more entertaining and well made ones. I personally found it quite gripping and it really drew me right into the story. So, if this is your kind of movie, I really don't see how you can miss... It is not especially 'Weighty' or profound, but then neither is it mindless. To me, it sits solidly in the middle where probably the broadest entertainment value is for most people.So... if you are looking for a good, entertaining, well acted and well directed Crime Thriller and you are not just exclusively interested in the newer Darker, moodier Noirish style that kind of predominates Crime Films at the moment, and you can just sit back and enjoy a good Cop \/ Serial Killer story, then you probably will have a LOT of fun watching this one as I did.

As the movie points out there are more Romans then slaves hence making slaves the normal ones and thus simple hence 'simple man'. Even when Spartacus has an army he is still in the query, the starting point of the film. Even in his death he died happy with a smile showing that hes not afraid of dying, the movie previously pointed out that that's a death of a slave When a slave dies he is free,but when a free man dies he loses what he had its a rough quote but it holds the same point. What I'm suggesting is that on the broad picture Spartacus seemed, changed but if you look at the details you find, that is simply not the case. Now, the obvious question remains who is he a slave to. Hes a slave to himself, the fact is hes still in the query and still is fighting to the death, but there's a difference hes not doing it for Rome and I think that's Kubrick's message. Its better to fight or to be a 'slave' for freedom then to be a slave for 'Rome'. Slave meaning citizen and Rome meaning any corrupt government that doesn't take there citizens seriously, as depicted in doctor strange love. **NO more SPOILERS** No wounder the movie won 4 Oscars. Spartacus is a timeless work of art that I hope wont be forgotten, because people die, ideas don't- V for vendetta. The movie is a great time though you need time to fully enjoy it I think its worth the time.Anyway this is my first movie critique whatever this is.

","genre":"Adventure, Biography, Drama"},{"date":"7 May 2015","score":"","review":" While the idea of an obviously Jewish nun was very funny in the initial plans for Bette Midler to star in this smash hit Touchstone comedy, the ultimate re-casting with Whoopie Goldberg probably did this more good in the long run. The story wasn't anything new, but the execution was so wonderful that it became one of the runaway comedy hits of the summer of 1993 and inspired both a sequel and a hit Broadway musical ultimately produced by the Whoop-ster herself. This basically could almost be called a semi-sequel to the 1960's pair of nun comedy's, The Trouble With Angels and Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows, as one of those film's nuns (Mary Wickes) is back again in the habit, and in the follow-up film to this (Sister Act II, Back in the Habit), she was once again behind the wheel of a bus, delivering funny lines and gently stealing the film from Whoopie and the most memorial mother superior in film history, the wonderful Maggie Smith.There's no originality in the plot of second string Vegas singer Goldberg hiding out in a convent after seeing her white mobster lover kill a snitch. But what happens in a convent hopefully stays in the convent, that is until Goldberg takes over the ultra flat chorus and turns them into earthly Supreme beings. Their singing gets the attention of locales not interested in church, and before you can make a sign of the cross, his holiness, the pope, is on his way for a visit, and Goldberg's hiding place is about to be revealed.

The premise is straight-forward enough the money that the two con away is really dough that belongs to a gangster, the scary, steel-eyed Lonegan (Robert Shaw), and when Luther is taken out by his men, Hooker wants revenge. Enter in expert-con\/Grifter Master Gondorff (Paul Newman), and instead of simple blood and bullets, there is a much different thing to do to get back the Long Con - all the money they can squeeze out of the guy.Just because it's in the 1970's, you should know, it's not really all THAT dark like a lot of other movies of its ilk. And that's fine; Hill knows what his movie is, and goes even further wipes and transitions are meant to call back to, I suppose, old-time movie clichés, and the Marvin Hamlisch music is so kitschy it'll make 'Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head' in Butch\/Sundance gritty by comparison. Perhaps one should also know that it's self-conscious about itself, and later movies like Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven would emulate how the characters - and by proxy, the audience - are all in on the joke (except for the flustered villain).While Shaw here may be a much better target - more of the kind of threat that can chill the bones and is impossible to look away from - than the later Andy Garcia example, I'm not sure if all of the film really *sticks* with me. It's all a crowd-pleaser, to be sure, and Hill knows that he has two gigantic stars. Oddly enough, Redford got an Oscar nomination for the character, and he's not bad... but it's the kind of character that isn't really that hard to play, and even during his cons (much like performances) he's more convincing in the voice. Newman fares much better for me, and my favorite scene in the film is with him as he does the first part of the Long Con against Lonegan, a poker game on a train where he acts like a louse, drinks like a fish, and gets under his skin.

One of the many problems facing this one is that the central motivation for the rampage is quite shoddy and rather lame, centering on the initial game in the beginning which runs for far too long and comes off as far too clichéd to have the impact it should have. When this part of the film is problematic, it certainly undoes this one a lot by coming up with a lame game that sets off a clichéd reaction which doesn't have all that much impact here because of that clichéd nature. As well, this here really undercuts the film itself as there's barely anything which can count itself as enjoyable slasher fare as a lot of these scenes are lame, drawn-out and pack almost zero suspense into them. There's very little of the really creepy type of scenes all throughout this, as the chase through the school hallways is just awfully overlong, clumsy and doesn't really feature anything to show her life's at stake so it just comes off as a bland, tedious scene from a film full of them, including the opening game and the sequences with the police attempts to catch the red herring which are supposed to be creepy or chilling but doesn't have anything worthwhile to add to the film. That would be enough to lower this one enough even without the utterly excruciating fact of this one being shot so dark that it makes for an extremely difficult to near- impossible time just making out what's actually happening at the time. It's blurry, dark and just doesn't kook all that appealing which really highlights the flaws even more as there's hardly anything that sticks out when it can't be seen all that well. There's a few good ideas here, though, that does work including the fact that the film sets up four different people as the killer and gives them each a fair amount of time to make people think is the real killer, which is really ingenious. Two people involved in subplots as being potential killers are given perhaps the most realistic killer motives that it's surprising none of them were the killer. The other thing about this one that works is the final twenty minutes in the film, as that is when all the murders take place as the rest is the prom set up. All of the deaths are all packed in at the ending, which leaves the ending to pack a giant wallop. Otherwise, there's not a whole lot of enjoyable stuff here.Rated R Graphic Violence, Adult Language, Nudity, and a scene of Rape.

Mother Superior Maggie Smith, having lightened up towards Sister Mary Clarence in the first entry, sends her old pals Mary Wickes, Kathy Najimy and Wendy Makkena to Vegas to bring Dolores back, to help save her school from scheming property owner James Coburn. Like The Bells of St. Mary's, they are in danger of loosing the school which may not be accredited, and Goldberg's job is to help them win financial support by getting the unenthusiastic chorus to L.A. for a choral contest. Yes, this is basically a Mickey\/Judy movie, Let's put on a show and crush the goals of some mean adult, only in nun's habits and catholic school uniforms. But while not as well thought out as the original, it remains entertaining and diverting.The edge is gone with the lack of a mob intrusion into the convent's life, but with many Catholic schools going under thanks to lack of funding or decreasing attendance, this was much more realistic. The subplots concerning individual students are many, from the troubled rebel who yearns for her mother's approval but doesn't go about the right way in getting it, to the talented young boy who shows he just needs some guts to bring out his true spirit, and pretty much the entire school's need to understand that these nuns are just as spirited, if more, than they are.What isn't realistic is the fact that just a year after singing for the pope, these nuns aren't recognized by the kids, and that they don't know who Dolores Van Cartier is from her previous newspaper headlines. Are you really a Vegas showgirl? one student asks incredulously. No, I am a headliner, Goldberg says as only she can. The lack of continuity between the two films gives it a definite sitcom feel, but unlike most sitcoms, this one rises above mediocrity because it is just so pleasant to sit through, especially when the kids get their act together, take it on the road, and sing to the Lord, not just to win, but to show that they've grown ever since Sister Mary Clarence came into their lives.Like in the two 1960's film where she played a bus driving nun, Mary Wickes gets back in front of the wheel, and also continues the string of funny delivery with lines that with other actors would just draw blank stares. Coburn is appropriately stolid, while such popular character actors as Barnard Hughes and Michael Jeter take on priestly roles with joyous glee. The same group of Broadway supporting players are back as singing nuns, with special mention to Susan Johnson, Beth Fowler and Ruth Kobart, as full voiced on screen as they were on stage. While the original Sister Act got its own big Broadway musical, the producers of that show (including Whoopie) were wise to realize that based upon previous experiences of hit musicals attempting sequels to just quit while they were ahead. Sister Act II is great as a video entertainment, and to take it any further would be fruitless.

But to have neither issue &#x97; to run harmoniously, to exist in a cloud of escapist contemplation &#x97; that is an exploit worthy of endless praise.This is why the films of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers remain to tread on such sacred ground. They're miles away from the Technicolor escapades of Gene Kelly, Judy Garland, Betty Grable; they start champagne drenched fires in a luminous black-and-white where reality fades and cinematic exhilaration placates the area. They're simultaneously artificial and real; here, artificiality is real. While The Great Depression wore on and midwesterners were gagging on dust, film took a detour into the extravagant and invented worlds where ordinary folks were rich, dressed expensively, traveled to the most beautiful parts of the world, lounged in the most luxurious hotels, found love with someone just as wealthy as them. In these worlds, international problems don't exist &#x97; more important ones, such as romantic misunderstandings and how will they get out of this one comedic situations, act as quaint replacements.It's all a bit ironic (considering the plight of the 1930s), but the heightened determination to make life seem happy\/joyful\/hopeful\/fun\/adorable ended up causing an influx of delicious screwball comedies and a superiorly pristine, dressed-to-impressed batch of musicals. The worst of them are still decent, sitting pretty while tickling our senses. But the best, most noticeably the (cough cough) Rogers and Astaire partnerings, are overwhelming in their dedication to wow. Top Hat, the fourth pairing of the quick-footed legends, is their most famous, most acclaimed moment. (Though I'm not so sure I agree with its frequent best of the best placement &#x97; Swing Time and The Gay Divorcée are pretty damn spectacular.) A delirious blend of slapstick antics, tuneful Irving Berlin melodies (including the instantaneously classic Cheek to Cheek), and awe-inspiring choreography, the film pulls off a fluffy plot with its keen sense of wit and dizzying amount of artistic talent.Astaire portrays Jerry Travers, a dancer staying in London to prepare for his starring role in an upcoming musical. While practicing one of his complicated tap routines in his ritzy hotel suite, he awakens the beautiful Dale Tremont (Rogers), who immediately flies upstairs to complain. Dale is irritated, but Jerry is attracted, deciding to spend the rest of his stay attempting to win her heart.Enter Conflict Dale is under the impression that Jerry is Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Horton), the producer of the show and the husband of her best friend, Madge (Helen Broderick).

But even tired mishaps can't stop them from unconsciously coupling.Roger Ebert called out Top Hat for its Idiot Plot and still deemed the film one of the Great Movies. It has a paint-by-numbers storyline, sure, but in a musical, a sound screenplay is the least of one's troubles. We want to be amazed, shocked, satisfied; Top Hat delivers more than we could expect. (Though for a Rogers and Astaire movie, it's everything we could hope for.) It's not that it does anything revolutionary &#x97; it's that it transitions from plot to song to dance so evenly that the popular notion of a musical (aka characters suddenly bursting into song!) is completely thrown away. Consider the famous Cheek to Cheek sequence. It begins with Astaire and Rogers in romantic conversation, continues into a sweet serenade, and delves into a flashy, unbroken ballroom dance that dares us to blink. Most scenes in Top Hat work like this; they range from scrambling to sentimental to hilarious, but never does something feel out of place, unwanted.

","genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance"},{"date":"7 May 2015","score":"","review":" To attain musical perfection is a feat rarely mimicked in the grasp of the take-it-or-leave-it genre. A manicured finger playing the why wasn't the movie successful blame game could easily point at too much spectacle, not enough comedy, or too much comedy, not enough spectacle. But to have neither issue &#x97; to run harmoniously, to exist in a cloud of escapist contemplation &#x97; that is an exploit worthy of endless praise.This is why the films of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers remain to tread on such sacred ground. They're miles away from the Technicolor escapades of Gene Kelly, Judy Garland, Betty Grable; they start champagne drenched fires in a luminous black-and-white where reality fades and cinematic exhilaration placates the area. They're simultaneously artificial and real; here, artificiality is real. While The Great Depression wore on and midwesterners were gagging on dust, film took a detour into the extravagant and invented worlds where ordinary folks were rich, dressed expensively, traveled to the most beautiful parts of the world, lounged in the most luxurious hotels, found love with someone just as wealthy as them. In these worlds, international problems don't exist &#x97; more important ones, such as romantic misunderstandings and how will they get out of this one comedic situations, act as quaint replacements.It's all a bit ironic (considering the plight of the 1930s), but the heightened determination to make life seem happy\/joyful\/hopeful\/fun\/adorable ended up causing an influx of delicious screwball comedies and a superiorly pristine, dressed-to-impressed batch of musicals. The worst of them are still decent, sitting pretty while tickling our senses. But the best, most noticeably the (cough cough) Rogers and Astaire partnerings, are overwhelming in their dedication to wow. Top Hat, the fourth pairing of the quick-footed legends, is their most famous, most acclaimed moment. (Though I'm not so sure I agree with its frequent best of the best placement &#x97; Swing Time and The Gay Divorcée are pretty damn spectacular.) A delirious blend of slapstick antics, tuneful Irving Berlin melodies (including the instantaneously classic Cheek to Cheek), and awe-inspiring choreography, the film pulls off a fluffy plot with its keen sense of wit and dizzying amount of artistic talent.Astaire portrays Jerry Travers, a dancer staying in London to prepare for his starring role in an upcoming musical. While practicing one of his complicated tap routines in his ritzy hotel suite, he awakens the beautiful Dale Tremont (Rogers), who immediately flies upstairs to complain. Dale is irritated, but Jerry is attracted, deciding to spend the rest of his stay attempting to win her heart.Enter Conflict Dale is under the impression that Jerry is Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Horton), the producer of the show and the husband of her best friend, Madge (Helen Broderick). Figuring he's a pig, as he's cheating on his wife, Dale does everything she can to dissuade him from chasing after her, attempting to romance a flamboyant fashion designer Alberto Beddini (Erik Rhodes) to rid of him. But even tired mishaps can't stop them from unconsciously coupling.Roger Ebert called out Top Hat for its Idiot Plot and still deemed the film one of the Great Movies. It has a paint-by-numbers storyline, sure, but in a musical, a sound screenplay is the least of one's troubles. We want to be amazed, shocked, satisfied; Top Hat delivers more than we could expect. (Though for a Rogers and Astaire movie, it's everything we could hope for.) It's not that it does anything revolutionary &#x97; it's that it transitions from plot to song to dance so evenly that the popular notion of a musical (aka characters suddenly bursting into song!) is completely thrown away. Consider the famous Cheek to Cheek sequence. It begins with Astaire and Rogers in romantic conversation, continues into a sweet serenade, and delves into a flashy, unbroken ballroom dance that dares us to blink. Most scenes in Top Hat work like this; they range from scrambling to sentimental to hilarious, but never does something feel out of place, unwanted. Many musicals suffer from the ugh, another song? complex &#x97; Top Hat doesn't. But, once again, it isn't a normal musical. It's a parfait of genial entertainment, impossible to dislike.

This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again.There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level.Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art.Overall, because you have probably already have seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that an educated cinema-goer can wish. The unforgettable and one of the kind motion picture, which probably like a great wine just keeps getting better with years.
