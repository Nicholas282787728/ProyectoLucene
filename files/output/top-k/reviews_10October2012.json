It was released a year after I was born, and the film's blend of sci-fi and fantasy must have had a very strong early influence on my developing mind, for as I grew I swiftly transformed into a massive geek, eventually becoming the tragic man-child I am today, still obsessing over monsters and heroes and quests and fantastical alternate worlds full of lasers and giant insects and time- travel and Space Marines.Regardless of the childish fancies that still plague my thoughts, I am now in fact an adult and was thus able to recently revisit the film with new eyes and the world-weary wisdom that comes with age. Would the film still enthrall me as it once had, or would it prove to be a ropey, ageing mess of clichés and bad special effects? As it turns out it was both; Krull is an entertaining, if somewhat derivative, slice of epic fantasy adventuring, mired in terrible acting and almost non-existent characterisation but carried forward by its intriguing visual design and its dark, eerie world, a film for which the IMDb rating of 5.9 out of 10 is entirely unjustified and tantamount to blasphemy.The plot of Krull draws from the same prince rescues princess from bad dude template that has been repeated endlessly down the years in everything from Robin Hood to Mario, and is riddled with holes and bizarre logic. It only really exists to drive the heroes on through a vast fantasy world, and it's here where the film shines. This is actually a beautiful looking film, and if you can ignore the occasional dodgy bit of bluescreen you'll find some impressive cinematography of the Italian mountains, with James Horner's rousing score doing wonders to fill those distant peaks and valleys with the promise of adventure. What sets are used feel unusual and are explored by the camera in interesting ways, from the odd angles of the castle to the pestilent swamp with its rows of dead trees disappearing into the thick yellow fog.The scenes set inside the Black Fortress are some of the most visually striking in the film. The film makers seem to have drawn heavily on surrealist influences, with a peculiarly organic, bone-like quality to many of the chambers. Rooms shaped like eyes or the clawing hand of a giant demon hang in a black void, presided over by The Beast itself, a rubbery special-effects atrocity that is thankfully only glimpsed in close-up, out-of-focus shots. Elsewhere the adventurers have to contend with an ebony bridge stretching out over a limitless abyss, and a horrific room that begins to sprout spikes from the walls at their entrance.The film is remarkably grisly in places. Most of the main quest is little more than a gauntlet of dangers that the heroes must overcome, their ranks swiftly whittled down as they close in on their goal. Their journey takes them through rocky passes, an impressively foul-looking swamp, a dark cavern where a giant spider stands guard over a melancholy old crone imprisoned in the centre of a vast web, and into the bowels of a dark fortress on the backs of huge horses with flaming hooves. As they travel on we see men swallowed up by quicksand, throttled by creepy shape-shifting changelings, crushed by stone walls, skewered by spikes, and blasted to atoms by the ever-present Slayers with their nifty laser guns and their disconcerting tendency to emit an awful shrieking sound when injured, their armour cracking open to reveal stringy, bloodied worms that writhe horribly into the ground.In fact the perils of the world draw too much of the film's focus, as most of the characters exist solely to perish in gruesome ways. Many of the men that the prince gathers around him are scarcely even seen until it's time for them to bite the bullet, and we are never given a chance to learn about their lives, or even really see what they look like. As such we can't possibly care about their fates, a sentiment seemingly shared by their comrades who press on relentlessly, with only the occasional troubled grimace spared in recognition of their fallen brethren as they are dispatched to the grave with impressively grisly flair.Of the characters that are actually awarded screen-time, most are similarly under-developed, though some do stand out more than others. The prince's old mentor Ynyr delivers his lines of wisdom in a pleasingly dour and authoritative manner, whereas the Cyclops, cursed with the ability to see the day of his own death, provides some enigmatic, otherworldly flavour to the ragtag bunch of forgettables. Liam Neeson, a long time before he acquired a very particular set of skills, shows his face as a womanising bandit, but ultimately has very little to work with.At one point the magician Ergo, bidding farewell to a barely known comrade, sadly states We had no time. This is certainly not an excuse the film makers can make, since at over two hours long the film could have had ample time to explore its more interesting characters. Instead they delivered a simple, shallow piece of fantasy that nevertheless has enough uniqueness and ghoulish charm to draw in anyone who can look past its slightly dated veneer. Like Flash Gordon, it's campy fantasy played straight, and is recommended viewing to any fan of the genre.Ordinarily I'd award Krull a 7 out of 10. However I'm so disappointed by its current average rating that I've given it a 10 to try and swing things in its favour.

","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"10 October 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" It's difficult to imagine a pre-zombie world nowadays, given that film, TV and computer games are now littered with the walking dead. The term 'zombie' had been coined many times before, possibly earlier than 1932's White Zombie, but was a label given to creatures and humans under voodoo spells in many different incarnations. In 1968, writers John Russo and George A. Romero took the term and applied it to the walking dead - brainless creatures who existed for nothing other than human flesh; a shuffling army that would stop only if their brain was destroyed, or their head removed from their body. The film was Night of the Living Dead, and although it was ridiculously criticised for its gory content (which was very extreme for its day), changed the face of horror forever, and would influence movies right up to the modern day.The now-familiar story begins with siblings Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny (Russell Streiner) visiting the grave of their father. With Johnny teasing Barbra about monsters and ghoulies, a man attacks Johnny, causing him to hit his head on a gravestone while Barbra flees to a nearby house. Traumatised by what she has just witnessed, Barbra is joined at the house by Ben (Duane Jones), who quickly starts boarding up the house to halt the encroaching zombies. They watch the news reports on the television about this strange attack, while married couple Harry (Karl Hardman) and Helen (Marilyn Eastman) emerge from the cellar, claiming their daughter has been attacked and is lying unconscious. With the outside fires set by Ben only delaying the zombie onslaught, they must hatch a plan to escape.It was alarming watching this film again after a number of years, after devouring many horror films in the past ten years or so. Living Dead's basic concept and plot devices have been used time and time again throughout the decades, and is a massive testament to the legacy of the film. It plays out like a guidebook on how to make a zombie film - the retreat, the do-good male lead, the annoying guy with a shirt and tie, the make-or-break run for the escape vehicle, the overwhelming final attack - are now so familiar. Yet after seeing this basic plot played out hundreds of times, Night of the Living Dead still seems fresh and ground-breaking, never coming across as clichéd or a tired idea.Of course, most horror films lack the social bite or political commentary of Romero's zombie series. While its 'sequel' Dawn of the Dead (1978) used its shopping mall setting as an attack of America's consumerist obsession, Night uses its informative news reports as a damning indictment of the U.S.A.'s gun-ho attitude and ultra-violent tendencies towards infiltration, possibly a reaction to the country's ridiculous response to the emergence of communism. And although Romero's claims that Duane Jones was cast solely on his audition, rather than the fact that he was black, the now-legendary final scenes prove to be either a massive bit of luck, or a pre-meditated stroke of genius from the writer's as a metaphor for the racial tension that was so prevalent in 1960's America.All that aside, this is simply great horror. Though (in my opinion) Romero's follow-up Dawn of the Dead is a better film, Night of the Living Dead is where it all began. It's grainy, hand-held, black-and- white cinematography not only adds a low-budget dirty quality to the film, but also proves what greatness can be done with an original idea, a lot of heart, and a heap of innovation, regardless of what your budget may be. Obviously, it's not scary anymore, and the gore levels are incredibly tame by today's standards, but the tension and claustrophobic atmosphere is still as effective as I would imagine it was back in 1968. And the final moments of pessimism that the film leaves you with does nothing but ensure the film is engraved into your memory.

In 1968, writers John Russo and George A. Romero took the term and applied it to the walking dead - brainless creatures who existed for nothing other than human flesh; a shuffling army that would stop only if their brain was destroyed, or their head removed from their body. The film was Night of the Living Dead, and although it was ridiculously criticised for its gory content (which was very extreme for its day), changed the face of horror forever, and would influence movies right up to the modern day.The now-familiar story begins with siblings Barbra (Judith O'Dea) and Johnny (Russell Streiner) visiting the grave of their father. With Johnny teasing Barbra about monsters and ghoulies, a man attacks Johnny, causing him to hit his head on a gravestone while Barbra flees to a nearby house. Traumatised by what she has just witnessed, Barbra is joined at the house by Ben (Duane Jones), who quickly starts boarding up the house to halt the encroaching zombies. They watch the news reports on the television about this strange attack, while married couple Harry (Karl Hardman) and Helen (Marilyn Eastman) emerge from the cellar, claiming their daughter has been attacked and is lying unconscious. With the outside fires set by Ben only delaying the zombie onslaught, they must hatch a plan to escape.It was alarming watching this film again after a number of years, after devouring many horror films in the past ten years or so. Living Dead's basic concept and plot devices have been used time and time again throughout the decades, and is a massive testament to the legacy of the film. It plays out like a guidebook on how to make a zombie film - the retreat, the do-good male lead, the annoying guy with a shirt and tie, the make-or-break run for the escape vehicle, the overwhelming final attack - are now so familiar. Yet after seeing this basic plot played out hundreds of times, Night of the Living Dead still seems fresh and ground-breaking, never coming across as clichéd or a tired idea.Of course, most horror films lack the social bite or political commentary of Romero's zombie series. While its 'sequel' Dawn of the Dead (1978) used its shopping mall setting as an attack of America's consumerist obsession, Night uses its informative news reports as a damning indictment of the U.S.A.'s gun-ho attitude and ultra-violent tendencies towards infiltration, possibly a reaction to the country's ridiculous response to the emergence of communism. And although Romero's claims that Duane Jones was cast solely on his audition, rather than the fact that he was black, the now-legendary final scenes prove to be either a massive bit of luck, or a pre-meditated stroke of genius from the writer's as a metaphor for the racial tension that was so prevalent in 1960's America.All that aside, this is simply great horror. Though (in my opinion) Romero's follow-up Dawn of the Dead is a better film, Night of the Living Dead is where it all began. It's grainy, hand-held, black-and- white cinematography not only adds a low-budget dirty quality to the film, but also proves what greatness can be done with an original idea, a lot of heart, and a heap of innovation, regardless of what your budget may be. Obviously, it's not scary anymore, and the gore levels are incredibly tame by today's standards, but the tension and claustrophobic atmosphere is still as effective as I would imagine it was back in 1968. And the final moments of pessimism that the film leaves you with does nothing but ensure the film is engraved into your memory.

I believe he is one of the most underrated actors of his own times. Barring a very few of his movies &#x96; I have almost seen all more then once. This was one of those exceptionally brilliant feel good movies. In this movie, Hugh Grant is a well off guy surviving on his dad's royalties, having a good time doing nothing but watching TV. He dates a single mother but unfortunately their relationship ends amicably, soon comes up with an idea to date single mothers only by joining a group called SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together). What life throws on him is a hilarious ride and how it all ends is simply superb, it actually made me laugh out loud like crazy, totally loved his straight face comedy. The guy even when in so much trouble makes a damn good face and tries to walk out of trouble in his own ways. Watch out for the last scene and his performance on stage &#x96; you will be in splits for sure. It's a damn good one time watch especially for those who love clean comedies. Not to be missed.The Movie As I mentioned earlier, Hugh is such a nice guy even in this movie that all his antics sound and look so genuine. His frustrations, confusions, reactions, even when he blurts out something in anger, it makes me laugh big time. Like it happens in this movie couple of times. The story is very simple and straight forward of a guy Will (Hugh Grant), who practically does nothing for a living as his dad composed some Christmas songs and the royalty coming from the same is more than enough for him to live a comfortable life. One fine day he meets a single mother but just in a couple of days he realizes they aren't meant to be together but since he is a nice guy and cares for her feelings &#x96; it's very hard for him to break off with her. To his shock, even she had the same feeling and they call it off amicably. But with this relationship he realizes one thing that its easy to be in a relationship with a single mother, have a good time and move on to the next, without any commitment or responsibility. During one of his grocery shopping trips he comes across an ad talking about a group called SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together), he joins them and claims that he has a two year old son whose currently gone with his separated wife. There he meets another parent and goes around with her. During one of their picnic trips, he meets her friend's 12 year old son Marcus (Nicholas Hoult). What happens in the picnic is hilarious stuff as Marcus kills a duck with a loaf of bread but Will saves him by creating a story, with which Marcus gets pretty impressed and develops a bond with him gradually.Marcus's mother too is a single parent and she tries committing suicide but somehow she is saved by Will and her neighboring friend who Will was dating previously. Marcus tries Will to date his mom to save her from loneliness but after their first date he follows Will and realizes that he neither has a kid nor is a divorcée. Marcus being a smart kid blackmails his way to his home and gets an access to Will's house as and when he wishes. They develop quite a good bond as they go out together and Will does helps him on couple of things, they do spend some good time together at Will's house. It was damn good to see Marcus's popularity starts growing in his school and he too ends up going around with a hot tom boyish girl Ellie (Natalia Tena), in the meantime Will too comes across Rachel (Rachel Weisz) and he uses Marcus as his own son to appear interesting to her. How they all meet and what goes around with Rachel's son and Marcus is hilarious, finally they end up breaking off as well and finally Will and Marcus too fight it off between themselves. What happens next and how it falls all over in right place is a classic ending. The last half an hour off the movie is too good with thinks going out of hands but again falling in right places. Marcus's social suicide even after his girl friends warning is too good and how Will saves him on stage is one hell of a scene. The way they have used one of my favorite songs Killing me softly here &#x96; it had me in splits. I am sure comedy lovers will enjoy this one big time.

This was one of those exceptionally brilliant feel good movies. In this movie, Hugh Grant is a well off guy surviving on his dad's royalties, having a good time doing nothing but watching TV. He dates a single mother but unfortunately their relationship ends amicably, soon comes up with an idea to date single mothers only by joining a group called SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together). What life throws on him is a hilarious ride and how it all ends is simply superb, it actually made me laugh out loud like crazy, totally loved his straight face comedy. The guy even when in so much trouble makes a damn good face and tries to walk out of trouble in his own ways. Watch out for the last scene and his performance on stage &#x96; you will be in splits for sure. It's a damn good one time watch especially for those who love clean comedies. Not to be missed.The Movie As I mentioned earlier, Hugh is such a nice guy even in this movie that all his antics sound and look so genuine. His frustrations, confusions, reactions, even when he blurts out something in anger, it makes me laugh big time. Like it happens in this movie couple of times. The story is very simple and straight forward of a guy Will (Hugh Grant), who practically does nothing for a living as his dad composed some Christmas songs and the royalty coming from the same is more than enough for him to live a comfortable life. One fine day he meets a single mother but just in a couple of days he realizes they aren't meant to be together but since he is a nice guy and cares for her feelings &#x96; it's very hard for him to break off with her. To his shock, even she had the same feeling and they call it off amicably. But with this relationship he realizes one thing that its easy to be in a relationship with a single mother, have a good time and move on to the next, without any commitment or responsibility. During one of his grocery shopping trips he comes across an ad talking about a group called SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together), he joins them and claims that he has a two year old son whose currently gone with his separated wife. There he meets another parent and goes around with her. During one of their picnic trips, he meets her friend's 12 year old son Marcus (Nicholas Hoult). What happens in the picnic is hilarious stuff as Marcus kills a duck with a loaf of bread but Will saves him by creating a story, with which Marcus gets pretty impressed and develops a bond with him gradually.Marcus's mother too is a single parent and she tries committing suicide but somehow she is saved by Will and her neighboring friend who Will was dating previously. Marcus tries Will to date his mom to save her from loneliness but after their first date he follows Will and realizes that he neither has a kid nor is a divorcée. Marcus being a smart kid blackmails his way to his home and gets an access to Will's house as and when he wishes. They develop quite a good bond as they go out together and Will does helps him on couple of things, they do spend some good time together at Will's house. It was damn good to see Marcus's popularity starts growing in his school and he too ends up going around with a hot tom boyish girl Ellie (Natalia Tena), in the meantime Will too comes across Rachel (Rachel Weisz) and he uses Marcus as his own son to appear interesting to her. How they all meet and what goes around with Rachel's son and Marcus is hilarious, finally they end up breaking off as well and finally Will and Marcus too fight it off between themselves. What happens next and how it falls all over in right place is a classic ending. The last half an hour off the movie is too good with thinks going out of hands but again falling in right places. Marcus's social suicide even after his girl friends warning is too good and how Will saves him on stage is one hell of a scene. The way they have used one of my favorite songs Killing me softly here &#x96; it had me in splits. I am sure comedy lovers will enjoy this one big time.

This is a film definitely meant to be seen in the dark! As one can discern from the 33 pages of user reviews thus far, you will either be scared out of your wits, or you won't. Like everything, it all comes down to the viewer's own expectations.While I find the film to be wonderfully creepy and atmospheric, I tend to admire it more as a psychological fright-fest. Both director Wise and screenwriter Nelson Gidding both came to view the story as not one about a haunted house, but instead the tale of the central character's (Julie Harris as Eleanor) descent into a nervous breakdown. They ran their idea by Shriley Jackson, who's novel the film is based on, and although she didn't support their interpretation, she nonetheless said it was A damn good idea! In later interviews Harris admits to having been going through a bout of depression while making the film, and it helped to add more dimension to her character. Eleanor is an angry repressed young woman who's not had any real life to speak of, having been saddled with caring for her ill disagreeable mother for the last eleven years. Many reviewers regard her character as being unsympathetically annoying and self-absorbed, but I find her bitterness and lashings-out to be in character, considering her life so lacking in joy or romantic companionship.This is what makes the story work; Eleanor's vulnerability makes her receptive to the weird goings-on around her. The house, evil, patient, waiting, finds Eleanor to be a kindred spirit, and she gradually falls under its spell as she develops a sense of belonging for probably the first time in her life. Initially invited to the house to be one of four observers of psychic phenomenon, she becomes increasingly at risk of losing her very sanity, an essay on the madness of loneliness.The small cast is good in their respective roles. Of particular interest is Claire Bloom who's character Theo is portrayed as a lesbian. This aspect is interesting mostly because of how the subject is handled (for 1963), barely a year after The Children's Hour made it the central theme of a motion picture. The film was initially supposed to include an early scene showing Theo breaking up with her female partner as she heads out for Hill House. The directors discarded it, deciding instead to let her sexuality become more gradually apparent to viewers.The film ends predictably but its explanation as understood by the other characters does a nice job of wrapping it up in a most eerie fashion. The Haunting is a must-see for all horror fans, if only to see how a multi-layered nightmare is supposed to look and feel.

(Johnny Depp would be great as Gomez with Christina Ricci as Mortica. Howie Mandel could play Uncle Fester.) Burton would do justice to all the characters because he is also too weird. Having seen both films, (the 3rd film and various sequels don't count) I can honestly say that although the 2nd film flows better, the first one is more like the TV series. The Addams Mansion is a character unto itself, and without it the family's charisma is diminished. When the family is evicted and moves to the cheap motel, they don't seem as creepy or perverted. A great comedic opportunity was lost here. The motel should have been more run-down, with rats. It could have been haunted or sinister like the Bates Motel, with real magic fingers on the bed. Even better, the family could have moved into an abandon house or a crypt near their own private graveyard. Instead of selling lemonade, I think they should have sold genuine hot dogs (made from real dogs). The Girl Scout cookie line would have still have worked.The Fester amnesia plot only works to-a-point and then it drags down the action of the film. It goes on far too long. (Why is Fester the center of both movies?) However, the mansion sets are far better in this film, than in the sequel the treasure room, dungeon play room and vault, library-study and the flushing exits are wonderful. Also, the trains and carnivorous Cleopatra are all here, as is the growling bear rug. It seems moreAddamsy than the sequel. A very-good but not a great first movie,made better by a perfect cast of characters, except that Christopher Lloyd doesn't seem to fit here at first. He does, however, grow into the role, once he realizes he is a true Addams. The family reunion party is also a great sequence, with all of the Addams clan and the great fighting Russian knife dance. The Addams rap ending title music (by MC Hammer) doesn't fit at all. A harpsichord version of the TV theme would have been far better.

I understand these people need to belong, no matter how, to some group where they can find companionship and a sort of family feeling, due to the horribly miserable personal lives they have, but to center that need in such a depressing place and with such shallow aims makes me lack all respect for them. Not even ONE of them talks about studying a career or something, something other than that vicious circle of costumes, heavy make up and shallow infantile display of vanity.After all, don't we all want a better situation in life, better neighborhoods, good education, good health, a nice group of friends..., and that goes not only for black people, but for Chinese, Japanese, South Americans, Central and North Americans and the whole world, since we all are human beings with similar needs and dreams.Maybe one is segregated because one places oneself in a segregated position.But these poor souls filled their lives parading every night in childish display, garbed in Halloween costumes and make ups and dreaming of making a splash on Vogue magazine (a close up on the cover better than one inside please) and as the next target to catch a millionaire (white if possible) etc. The yearly Rio de Janeiro Carnival, compared to what we see here, is Heaven on Earth!!

Now in the most socially civilized countries there is same sex marriage and adoption, and in some, like here in Argentina, a person can go to a Registry Office without witnesses and change his\/her name to the genre they feel it's their own (no medical or surgical intervention needed) and gay tourists can get married within two hours, no questions asked.So, let's hope that gay underworld shown here doesn't exist any longer and people like the ones shown in this movie, nowadays have higher aims for their future (and, better yet, for their PRESENT lives).

With that said, this movie is a heartwarming masterpiece and seeing as how it's now celebrating it's 30th anniversary, I want to praise this epic classic.The story is heartwarming with tear-jerking moments that would make you cry tears, the characters are likable and the actors like Henry Wallace, Robert Mcnaughton, and Drew Barrymore played their roles with great spirit. The pacing is perfectly and develops the characters brilliant and the relationship between Elliot and ET were heartwarming and enjoyable to watch and the direction from Spielberg has a lot of focus to it, but the strongest aspect goes to the beautiful music score from John Williams especially the climax scene which is not only tear-jerking, but amazingly epic.Overall, E.T. the Extra Terrestrial is a flawless masterpiece from Steven Spielberg and would always be recommended to people young and old. With all my heart, this deserves a thumbs up from me.

This was included in its list of 30 must watch movies for a B school grad. I downloaded it then and watched it today. After a long period of time, I had to go on different forums to understand what the f**k i just saw. Otto is a youngster who has been kicked out from his job at a supermarket. He is recruited as a re- possession man by Bud. There job is to take the possession of a car whose EMI has been delayed. The movie runs on a parallel track which gives it the weirdness. There is a scientist who has escaped with something lethal in the trunk of his car and various government agencies are trying to capture him. The acting is competent with Harry Dean Stanton getting the best lines. The special effects are amazingly amateur and some of the sci-fi sequences are unintentionally hilarious. The movie is a cult classic. But the reason behind this could not be understood by a normal mind like me. 2.5 out of 5 for the Repo Man. Went it with high expectations. am mildly disappointed. This was remade as Repo Men starring Jude Law. Won't be catching that anytime soon.

By far the worst is Woody Harrelson. Admittedly, what his character is forced to do and say is stupid, illogical and downright ridiculous. But a really good actor, finding himself cast in this unbelievable shell of a role, would do something. Barrymore, for example, would really send it up; Mason would play it really tongue-in-cheek; Cooper would act against the role and deliver his lines frozen-faced. But Harrrelson does zilch. He acts it out as if the author was William Shakespeare, totally ignoring the fact that his character is always inconsistent, often motiveless, and sometimes absolutely ridiculous. Demi Moore does a little bit better, particularly when she gets away from the incompetent Harrelson, and is partnered by a real actor in Robert Redford. In fact, Redford is the only reason anyone would bother to see this movie. He brightens every scene in which he appears. And when he's forced to say something stupid, he smacks it across with a twinkle in his eye. That's what acting is all about -- not emoting like mad and running off at the mouth!

What a marvelous character Bloody Mary is, and how well played. She gets two terrific songs, as well. And Ray Walston is grand in everything. The anti-racism message is still (alas) applicable today and keeps the story relevant.What keeps this from being a 10\/10 star film for me is the use of color and other filters. Geez, what was the director thinking? In particular, his opinion that sulfurous yellow somehow was the color of new love befuddles me. Perhaps he was colorblind?
