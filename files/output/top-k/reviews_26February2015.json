I've seen some of his work, such as Radiohead's Karma Police, Jamiroquai's Virtual Insanity, the Levi's commercial where a man and a woman crash through walls and the Barclay's commercial with Samuel L. Jackson. He's a visual delight. He's Stanley Kubrick mixed with the Coen Brothers. And when he does films, He is still the next Stanley Kubrick.Sexy Beast is the director's first feature and...It's a well done debut. As with my other reviews, I'll tell you why.What's the story? Gal Dove (Ray Winstone) is a retired crime lord. He is living the good life in Spain with the woman he loves, DeeDee (Amanda Redman) as well as having a good time with their friends, Aitch (Cavan Kendall) and Jackie (Julianne White). All is well for the two couples, until the sociopath known as Don Logan (Ben Kingsley) comes in to destroy their peaceful life. He comes in and offers Gal to work a bank heist led by Teddy Bass (Ian McShane). Gal initially refuses, but Don treats him like sh*t and demands that he does the job. Gal then does so in order to protect his beautiful wife and partakes in an underwater bank heist. But Don doesn't appear in the heist, leaving the colleagues suspicious. What really happened to Don? Will the heist go well? Will Gal save his friends and wife? It's up to you to find out.Now for the reasons1. The direction. It contains beautiful visuals, but also contains awesome performances. Glazer not only pays attention to detail but also performances as well. He can also tell a story through visuals, like a modern-day Stanley Kubrick. It's well presented, well thought out and perfectly placed. It proves that from a commercial and music video background, you can still tell a story through visuals.2. The performances. There is a talented cast delivering the movie. The performances are awesome, particularly from Ray Winstone and Ben Kingsley. They have genuine responses, actions and emotions. Like a high-rate play, the performances are the core of the film. If anything, they should have gotten BAFTA's or Academy Awards for their performances. They're a departure from their usual ego.3. Don Freaking Logan! What can I say? He makes the movie. He is funny, scary, insulting, demanding and here to ruin everyone's lives...and he is an awesome sociopath! Right from the first second you see him, you know he's going to raise hell. He has a lot of memorable moments and a personality that would make Hannibal Lector whiz his pants. I just love how trouble making and hell raising he is. Every time he is on the screen, you are scared shitless. You feel his presence every time he appears. You are either scared of him or you laugh at him, depending on what you think of that character. Either way, he is awesome.4. The visuals. Like 2001 A Space Odyssey, Sexy Beast has beautiful visuals. Some of the shots are really amazing and are very well-presented. Most of the story is told through the visuals and it's told well. Some scenes are straight-forward. Most are left to your interpretation. It's kind of like looking at art. You feel fascinated with the visuals and keep looking at them to see what most of them mean.I do have one flaw with this movieThe story is lacking. I mean, it's not a bad story, It's a simple one. But some of it is filled with clichés. I personally wasn't interested in the second act in London. I kind of felt I was in a different movie. Not to say it's bad, but it's not really that interesting. A bit of it is, but it's not as good as the first act. But overall, a really well done film. It has great performances, cinematography, characters, direction and a really memorable character. It's worth a watch based on Ben Kingsley alone or anything else. The detail on this film is amazing and is well spent on that. It looks beautiful. Believe it or not, bring on Glazer's next movie.

One of these days, I would like to see a Jesus movie in which the three wise men are seen leaning way back in their camels, looking straight up, with one of them saying, Well, the star is directly overhead, so I guess this barn must be the place. But this movie, like all other depictions of the event, simply shows the star about thirty degrees above the horizon, no matter how close the wise men get to the manger.It is surprising that many of the well-known miracles were only mentioned, not depicted visually no scene of Jesus turning water into wine, walking on water, or feeding the multitude with a basket of loaves and fishes. It is not surprising, on the other hand, that we do not see Jesus's prediction that some of the people he is talking to will still be alive when the kingdom of God comes.A lot of sins go unmentioned in this movie. Jesus does not say it is adultery to lust after a woman in your heart, or that it is a sin to get divorced, or that marrying someone who is divorced is adultery. But we do get the scene where the adulteress is saved by Jesus, who defies the mob by saying that the one without sin should cast the first stone. That's what the audience wants to hear, not that lust or divorce are also forms of adultery, but that real adultery itself will be forgiven.As is typical for a movie about Jesus, he never talks about Hell. There is a movie in which Jesus spends a lot of time talking about all the people who are going to Hell, The Gospel According to St. Matthew (1964), but that is an exception. All the other Jesus movies leave that topic pretty much alone, at least as far as the sermons of Jesus are concerned. In The Greatest Story Ever Told, other people talk about Hell instead. In one scene, there is a religious figure who says that God is going to punish the wicked, but Jesus admonishes him, saying that God is about mercy. Never mind that what the guy was saying was actually similar to what Jesus himself says in the Bible, in this movie, Jesus will have none of it. This is followed shortly by a scene in which John the Baptist tells King Herod that he is going to Hell for committing adultery, which again is consistent with the Biblical Jesus but not the Jesus of this movie. And when Jesus is giving Peter the keys of the kingdom, even the relatively innocuous expression gates of Hell is left out of Jesus's speech.That this movie plays it safe in its treatment of Jesus, avoiding the depiction of anything that might make the audience uncomfortable, is understandable. What is not understandable is the movie's treatment of Judas. Where the Bible is ambiguous (dare I say inconsistent) regarding Judas, so too is the movie. For example, there is some debate as to whether Judas received communion at the Last Supper. Consequently, the movie is ambiguous on this point as well. We see Judas holding the cup near his lips. Then the camera cuts away to Jesus, who makes a brief remark, after which we see Judas still holding he cup, leaving it an open question as to whether he took a sip. Fine. But where the Bible is not ambiguous is on Judas's motive for betraying Jesus. Judas negotiates with the chief of priests to get thirty pieces of silver for delivering Jesus. The motive is money, pure and simple. But in the movie, instead of asking for money, we hear Judas going on about what a wonderful person Jesus is. And then, somewhat later, when he is given the pieces of silver that he did not ask for, he says he didn't want any money, which leaves his betrayal of Jesus completely unmotivated. One almost gets the impression that the people who made this movie did not want to show Judas in a bad light, even though this is the man that Dante did not hesitate to put right next to Satan in the frozen lake at the center of the earth.There is one thing in this movie that should have been kept out, and that is John Wayne. Right at the moment of Jesus's death, we hear the Duke saying, Truly, this man was the son of God, in that unmistakable voice of his, and it is hard to keep from laughing.

If you think that I'm exaggerating then you've gotta watch it, because it's not just a horror film, it's a disturbing and eye-opening view of suffering, misery and loss, and a love that ultimately can't exist. It's surprisingly painful to watch, what with scenes such as Brundle literally falling apart, decaying in front of his reporter girlfriend, and as she hugs him while he cries her eyes are filled with a horror and confusion, no longer able to see the kind man she fell in love with, just the fly he's becoming.Special effects add several scenes to this movie that aren't gory per-say, but hell, they are D-I-S-T-U-R-B-I-N-G!!! As a little girl I watched The Fly on television years ago and to this day the scene with the baboon showing up in the teleporter inside-out, crying in terror and surrounded by its own organs and bones, creeps me out on dark nights. The maggot baby scene is disgusting and creepy beyond belief, but The Fly is unique in that the effects don't take away from the story at all, they're spared for the few moments when they're best needed and despite the makeup and effects used to give Brundle his sick appearance, you can still feel sorry for him and sympathize with his horrible situation. It takes a lot of power for a movie to achieve that and I think The Fly did an amazing job.The Fly is also full of late Eighties nostalgia; the music, fashion, hairstyles and buildings are all reminiscent of living in an urban area in the 1980's. If you're into the 'love triangle' plot, this movie has that too with the involvement of Borans as a main character.This movie deserves so much more than its current reputation; very rarely have I seen a sci-fi horror film that can be so sinister yet so tragic all at once and it leaves a lasting impression - once you've seen it, it's a horror film that makes you wonder.

It's surprisingly painful to watch, what with scenes such as Brundle literally falling apart, decaying in front of his reporter girlfriend, and as she hugs him while he cries her eyes are filled with a horror and confusion, no longer able to see the kind man she fell in love with, just the fly he's becoming.Special effects add several scenes to this movie that aren't gory per-say, but hell, they are D-I-S-T-U-R-B-I-N-G!!! As a little girl I watched The Fly on television years ago and to this day the scene with the baboon showing up in the teleporter inside-out, crying in terror and surrounded by its own organs and bones, creeps me out on dark nights. The maggot baby scene is disgusting and creepy beyond belief, but The Fly is unique in that the effects don't take away from the story at all, they're spared for the few moments when they're best needed and despite the makeup and effects used to give Brundle his sick appearance, you can still feel sorry for him and sympathize with his horrible situation. It takes a lot of power for a movie to achieve that and I think The Fly did an amazing job.The Fly is also full of late Eighties nostalgia; the music, fashion, hairstyles and buildings are all reminiscent of living in an urban area in the 1980's. If you're into the 'love triangle' plot, this movie has that too with the involvement of Borans as a main character.This movie deserves so much more than its current reputation; very rarely have I seen a sci-fi horror film that can be so sinister yet so tragic all at once and it leaves a lasting impression - once you've seen it, it's a horror film that makes you wonder.

The only difference is, I'll be reviewing the original Japanese version of the film, known as Mewtwo's Counterattack and I will be comparing it to it's English counterpart, as everyone knows as Mewtwo Strikes Back. Do I even need to explain the premise? Everyone that grew up with Pokemon in the 90's has watched this movie, then again there's a bunch of new fans out there that have no idea this film exists, so might as well. The mythical Mew, the rarest of all Pokemon, has gained an unexpected brother. Through bioengineering, and the DNA of a Mew fossil, Mewtwo is born, and he is not happy. Who is he? Why did the humans create him? Confused and outraged, Mewtwo summons Ash Ketchum and his friends to the unknown New Island, in order to show the world that he is stronger, so he is the real Mew. It's a battle for all Pokemon fans to remember. So what did I think? As a kid, I adored the first movie in all it's English 4Kids prime, but now that I've watched the original version of the film, I want to strangle 4Kids by their throats.Mewtwo's Counterattack is not only infinitely better then it's dumbed down counterpart, but it still stands as one of the best Pokemon movies of all time. Lets talk about the main character of the film, besides Ash, Mewtwo. As we know, Mewtwo was portrayed as a sadistic antagonist who wanted destroy the world in the English dub, but in the original version, Mewtwo is chaotic neutral. He never wanted to take over the world, in fact he states that no one has the right to rule the world, not even himself. His main goal was to prove that, since he is stronger, he is the real Mew. That is much more interesting then the typical rule- the-world villain 4Kids pulled out of their butts. Not to mention 4Kids cut out the prologue of the film The Birth of Mewtwo, which was incredibly stupid of them! Not only did this short make Mewtwo a more sympathetic character, but it was also essential to the plot! It explains where the cloned Charizard, Venusaur, and Blastoise came from, as well as the very reason why Mewtwo was created. It has nothing to do with Giovanni and Team Rocket, that's all I'm saying. Oh, and do you remember the Fighting is bad. message the English version of the movie had? This is one of the reasons why critics disliked the film, Pokemon fight all the time, you're being hypocritical. The original message was much stronger Even if they're clones, they're still beings of life. They all have a place in the world.. But of course, 4Kids thought kids were too dumb to understand that, so they replaced it. Okay I think I ranted on 4Kids enough, lets move on. The animation is awesome, all hand-drawn, (Not that I have anything against computer animations.) and it has a certain grit to it. I don't know, it feels nostalgic to look at again, I love it when movies do that. I should also mention the English dub has it's own separate soundtrack from the original. From what I hear 4Kids changed the music so it's More American and Easier for kids to listen to. I call this bull crap, however the music in both versions of the movie are amazing, but there are moments where they feel out of place. For example, when Mewtwo is capturing all of the Trainer's Pokemon in his own Poke Balls, the music in the Japanese version is rather jolly and makes you go Huh? Whereas, the music that played in the English version during that scene was more foreboding and heart-racing.Plus I can't say anything bad about Tears of Life that track still makes me want to cry every time. Speaking of crying, the infamous ending of the movie, where Ash dies (He really turns to stone.) is as heart-wrenching as it was in the past, in both versions of the film. I'm not ashamed to say that I bawled my eyes out watching it again, and Ash is my least favorite Pokemon character! Then again, this was when he's still learning to be a Trainer, and wasn't an ageless idiot like he is nowadays, so that's forgiven. My only gripe with the movie (Besides the English dub) is that Mewtwo's motives can be a little hard to understand in the beginning, but that's about it.Overall, Mewtwo's Counterattack is both refreshing and nostalgic for those that watched the English dub when they were kids, and I strongly recommend every Pokemon fan to watch it.

The plot of the film focuses around two rival gangs vying for more money than the other and how this affects the main characters Han and Trish. The rivalry takes the form of plans to develop a sports stadium. This is easily the least engaging part of the story. From boring golf meetings to uninteresting characters this unique plot point offers simply a backdrop for the events of the film. This is a flaw the film carries throughout the story whilst I can confidently say that the characters are the saving grace of the movie. Unfortunately they rarely develop engaging drama for the characters to be involved in. The major issue I had with the film was pacing. This movie definitely would have been aided by heavy cutting. Roughly the first twenty minutes, in my opinion, are completely unnecessary and I believe the movie should have begun with the prison scene. Not only is this the first time we are introduced to our protagonist Han but his break out is the most interesting action scenes in the entire film. Arguably one of the best I've ever seen in film but it is heavily truncated but terribly executed exposition; and when I say that it was the best action scene in the film that actually holds a lot of weight because this movie is abundant with action. Obviously with Jet Li as the main actor you should set your expectations at a certain level but this movie goes far and beyond that. Action after action after action with the bare minimum of story during the first half leaves the viewer feeling disconnected. It would have been of far greater value to cut some of the fight scenes and replace them with more interaction between Han and Trish, the female protagonist, especially since the chemistry between the two was very palpable. As stated previously the characters and their relationships are what I found to be the peaks of this film. The three core relationships in the film, Han and Trish, Han and his father, and Trish and her father, all hit the correct notes. From the flirtatious nature of the protagonists to Han's damaged past with his father the actors are very crucial in the portrayal and the strong response they encourage. Whilst I know the romance plot is very important to this movie I particularly found the conversations between Trish and her father Isaak the most powerful. Isaak is the leader of a mob family but is not blind to the realities of his world. He is making plans to secure a legal income based future for his children. This comes to a front when Isaak's son and Trish's older brother is murdered. Isaak only wishes to help his children and whilst Trish initially blames him for her brother's death she doesn't play the stereotypical spoilt child. She instead recognises what her father is trying to do and agrees to trust him. Every time these two interacted I felt as if the film should have dropped the unnecessary ties to Shakespeare's writing and had a larger focus on these very dynamic characters. However, that's not the film we have and it leaves us with the relationship between Trish and Isaak and my greatest take away from the film. The third also falls apart in minor ways. Firstly due to the pacing issues it feels a long time coming and as result I was thinking about it more than I should have; this lead to me realising the slight twist ending where the henchmen of both of the families would betray their respective superior. I feel like this was supposed to hit a lot harder than it did but I feel like it was communicated and foreshadowed far to on the nose. Perhaps this also on the actors playing the roles, especially the Mac character because from the second he appears on screen you can't help but question his motives. This is contrasted nicely against Han's father who we are ambiguous about until he opens up to his son. However, before that moment he genuinely could have gone either way showing shades of good and bad; and coincidentally that is how I would also describe this film. There was huge potential here and the execution is done very well in regards to the primary characters.

It's that kind of movie, ludicrous and crass yet not without some vicarious thrills along the way, but these are overdone and come in too quick succession. In the end then, it's easier to mock than be shocked by what's on display here.Which I'm sure was hardly the director's intention.

Blood for Dracula, on the other hand, is a fairly restrained film by comparison. Although this is a relative statement because going by any other standard this is a quite delirious version of Dracula. Needless to say, it entirely ignores the original novel and furrows its own path, updating the character quite successfully for its 70's time-frame. In this sense, Dracula is what can best be described as a blood junkie. He spends considerable screen-time vomiting up unpure blood and generally is more akin to a drug addict than the gallivanting count of old. The story has him moving from Romania to Italy in search of fresh virgins. He is welcomed by a down-on-his-luck marquis who actively encourages him to marry one of his four daughters. Before long he is feeding off them but, unfortunately for him, a local handyman has been going around systematically de-purifying them!You've got to hand it to Paul Morrissey; he has directed another bona fide cult classic with this one. It's very interesting how the traditional myth has been twisted into the tale of a junkie vampire. Its Cinecittà origins also ensure that this is an exploitation film that has the added advantage of looking quite sumptuous. But much of the strengths here, like its sister film; can be found in the campy deadpan performances and insane dialogue. Udo Kier is on form again as Dracula in another commendably committed performance, his assistant is played by Arno Juerging in an eye-poppingly bizarre way and Joe Dallesandro under-acts spectacularly again as the somewhat questionable 'hero' Marxist handyman who at one point rapes a young teenage girl in order to make her unsuitable prey for the dastardly count! This latter scene is topped off with Dracula licking blood off the floor that was discharged on account of it being the girl's first sexual encounter. Yech! Look out too for a humorous cameo performance from Roman Polanski and a rare chance to see future Suspiria actress Stefania Cassini speak her dialogue in her real voice, usually she is dubbed but here her very heavy and quite beautifully exotic Italian accent is on full display (as well as pretty much every other part of her it has to be said).This is probably as much a sexploitation film as it is a horror movie. There are significant amounts of screen time dedicated to naked fumbling. This approach, along with the film's generally quite transgressive content does make for a pleasingly in-your-face viewing experience.

It's fair to say this second film in the Indiana Jones franchise (chronologically the first) has everything you would expect from an 80s adventure film. It took the franchise in a new direction and tried to show us how Indy went from being a cynical, somewhat greedy archaeologist to the more principled and less jaded character we know from the first film.Temple of Doom opens with a music number in Shanghai as Indy attempts to finalise a business negotiation with an Asian gangster named Che Lao. In a portent of things to come, the music number is Anything Goes, which is certainly true of this film, though in the most fun way possible. Lao betrays Indy by poisoning him, and Indy is forced to run around looking for antidote, shoot his way out with help from his young friend Shorty and taking the nightclub singer Willie hostage. The three escape a plane crash in an inflatable dinghy and end up in an Indian village, where they learn the village is suffering a curse and their children have been stolen along with some magic stones. Indy has a theory, that the children have been kidnapped by the Thuggee cult, who are thought to be dormant and so sets off to find the Prime Minister of Pankot.For the next twenty minutes, you'd be excused for thinking you are watching a sequel to Romancing the Stone as our intrepid heroes trek through the jungle, having encounters with snakes, elephants and various other jungle animals. They eventually get to the castle, Indy is told his Thuggee theory is daft by both the Prime Minister and child Maharajah. In the meantime Willie is stuck in a scene from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, sitting around a macabre table with people eating chilled monkey brains fresh from the skull, snake surprise (they're alive!) and eyeball soup.After some assassins try to kill Indy, we actually find ourselves in an Indiana Jones movie for a little while as Indy and Shorty stumble upon a hidden chamber and try to find their way through. They get stuck and Willie has to come and save them (he shouts We are going to Die!! giving the distributors a sound grab that was used in every trailer) and then they end up in the Temple.Once the film gets to the Temple, that's where we stay till right near the end. The Temple is kind of like a more colorful version of the chamber from the 1930s Boris Karloff film The Mummy, but kind of reminds of the sacrifice scene in King Kong as well. The final showdown happens on a rope bridge and is reminiscent of the ending to The Man Who Would Be King (another great adventure movie that is well worth checking out).In this we kind of see Indy change from a fairly greedy man chasing fortune and glory and not believing in mysticism to a character closer to the one we see in Raiders. Harrison Ford gives another excellent and committed performance. Of the other cast Amrish Puri, as Mola Ram, the leader of the evil cult, is a great villain, though a little hammy, the ham is appropriate. Kate Capshaw who played Willie went on to marry the director. She is OK, but many fans didn't like her screaming damsel character. Jonathan Ke Quan as Short Round is OK, but like Willie, only appears to be there to meet what was seen as a requirement at that time. A child side kick.So Temple of Doom is a really good example of 80s adventure film making, just check out this and Young Sherlock Holmes, Or Romancing the Stone\/ Jewel of the Nile or the Goonies. You can tell they are the same vintage. However, Ford is so good in this and the action scenes are done so well, and a lot of care is taken with effects. For a kid growing up in the 80s, this movie was where it's at, to a greater degree than any of the other Indy films. Looking back now it's considerably more dated than Raiders or Last Crusade, but it's still a lot of fun. A wonderful example of a prime vintage, overflowing with nostalgia. While Raiders harked back to Saturday matinée fun, this one encapsulated what it took to be an action adventure film in the 1980s. And it works a treat. Another classic.

It's fair to say this second film in the Indiana Jones franchise (chronologically the first) has everything you would expect from an 80s adventure film. It took the franchise in a new direction and tried to show us how Indy went from being a cynical, somewhat greedy archaeologist to the more principled and less jaded character we know from the first film.Temple of Doom opens with a music number in Shanghai as Indy attempts to finalise a business negotiation with an Asian gangster named Che Lao. In a portent of things to come, the music number is Anything Goes, which is certainly true of this film, though in the most fun way possible. Lao betrays Indy by poisoning him, and Indy is forced to run around looking for antidote, shoot his way out with help from his young friend Shorty and taking the nightclub singer Willie hostage. The three escape a plane crash in an inflatable dinghy and end up in an Indian village, where they learn the village is suffering a curse and their children have been stolen along with some magic stones. Indy has a theory, that the children have been kidnapped by the Thuggee cult, who are thought to be dormant and so sets off to find the Prime Minister of Pankot.For the next twenty minutes, you'd be excused for thinking you are watching a sequel to Romancing the Stone as our intrepid heroes trek through the jungle, having encounters with snakes, elephants and various other jungle animals.

You feel compelled to share personal information with this stranger, deep thoughts that no one other than you have pondered or heard, and talk until your throat is raw about everything you can think of in that given moment. Your become verbally diuretic, and after it's over, you're upset that the conversation has ended, but you've achieved a state of personal tranquility thanks to a release of all that was on your mind that you are at a sort of bliss. It's a strange thing to articulate, and those who have had that kind of connection know precisely what I'm talking about. To those who can't pinpoint that kind of connection (if you have to think hard about it, you've probably never had one), you're in for one soon.Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise, which kickstarted a trilogy that spanned the course of three separate decades and analyzed Linklater's favorite cinematic idea, time, is an ode to that kind of comfortable, life-affirming connection we all should experience. Linklater thankfully devotes an entire film to that kind of connection, making a film entirely focused on characters rather than the events, the location, or the supporting characters surrounding them. It's as if Linklater got fed up at watching interesting characters, their motivations and their potentials, in other films squandered so other, more trivial matters could be attended to. In Before Sunrise, he strips down everything to two central characters and their views on a variety of different issues, philosophical ideas, and past experiences.Those two characters are Jesse and Céline (Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy), who, from the moment they meet on a train-car from Budapest heading to Vienna, they reveal personal details and personal opinions on love, romance, and just their general upbringings. When Jesse's stop at Vienna finally rolls around, he convinces Céline to hop off the train with him, to which she throws caution to the wind and obliges. The two divulge in a great deal of personal matters together; he is a romantic soul masquerading as a cynic after breaking up with his girlfriend, the whole reason he's in Vienna in the first place, and she has fallen before and is cautious about doing so again. The two, however, recognize their separate agendas and treat this night as their one and only encounter, leading them to get personal and loquacious with one-another while walking through the entire city.As stated, Linklater strips this film back a plethora of layers to simply being about these two characters. Linklater even limits pictorial distractions, as the two characters walking through the city of Vienna leaves for a great deal of possibility to stumble upon something distracting. That occurs, if I remember correctly, once in the film, and it's incorporated so well into the discussion and the flow that you're bound to miss it. It's no lie that Linklater has seriously found himself committed to making this project about this simple yet unbelievably affecting kind of connection, which, in this case, transcends personal bounds into becoming romantic, leading the characters to question how they feel and how they want to proceed.Hawke and Delpy, I feel, aren't doing much acting here; part of me feels they're conveying their own kind of presences to one another and that there's little effort required on their part to change who they are or become something they are not. The film also bears the necessary pacing element of being lax and carefree, never rushing these characters onto the next setup nor making them take detours for comedy's sake. This is Linklater driving the truck down a path that has many different routes and he chooses the most direct route, and simultaneously, the most beautiful and mystifying.Before Sunrise beautifully illustrates the power of human connection through two strong performers and a writer\/director obsessed with the impact and idea of time and the realism and the aforementioned kind of connection. Here, he displays his affinity and talent for both through a film that is equal parts contemplative in a philosophical sense and also incredibly beautiful on a human scale. This is a romantic comedy for people who have grown sick and tired of falsified, picturesque romantic comedies and hunger for something genuine, real, and lasting, much like the impact of these characters' relationship with one another in the film.Starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.

Also the ruthless treatment of the POW camp towards the British colonel was hard to watch, but it was fitting towards how the Axis powers actually treated the Allies. David Lean's film is about a British colonel named Nicholson who he and his men were captured by the Japanese. After enduring endless amounts of torture, Nicholson is able to convince the commander of the camp, Saito to allow him to help design the bridge they are tasked to building. However, the Allies hatch a plot, whom Nicholson is completely oblivious of, to destroy the bridge. If you want fine acting, you have come to the right place. Alec Guinness truly absorbs himself into the role of Nicholson and we see his acting ability fly high as Nicholson endures Japanese brutality to convince them to do what he wants. Sessue Hayakawa as Saito was indeed very good in his role as we see personal greed overcome his character. William Holden was excellent and does not hold back as the sarcastic American soldier, Shears. We also get a strong performance from Jack Hawkins as Major Warden, the man who knows his explosives. Overall, The Bridge on River Kwai is probably one of the top ten films ever made. Any young person should view this film, as this epic holds up very well.

Just as you think the romantic element of the film will hijack the idea of the conflicts of self-motivation and self-doubt the narrator is having with herself, writers Stockwell and Lizzie Weiss rebound and help the romantic interest of the film's lead character motivate her rather than distract her. In addition, the film also respectfully portrays the surfing culture as more than a gaggle of stoned losers that ride waves and do nothing but slum when the tide comes in.The film stars Kate Bosworth, an actress who, I assume, in 2002 was looking to be the next Kirsten Dunst or Reese Witherspoon until the glory faded, as Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth), a teenager working as a maid at a tourist hotel in Hawaii and surfing with her best friends Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake) on the side. Anne Marie is also taking care of her fourteen-year-old sister Penny (Mika Boorem) after their mother left for Las Vegas with another guy she met, in addition to training for her surfing comeback in a huge, publicized competition in North Shore. Winners, or highly-skilled participants, of the race are known to get surfing magazine deals left and right, and being a famous female surfer, breaking the stereotype, and gaining the glory for women everywhere is part of Anne Marie's dream.In the mix, she winds up meeting Matt Tollman (Matthew Davis), an NFL quarterback in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Both individuals catch the eye of each other, but don't immediately strike up any flirtatious behavior because both have other things on their mind. Overtime, however, the two drift towards each other and wind up becoming closer, with Anne Marie's resistance always remaining in tact, as she doesn't want to be another hilarious story for Matt to tell his teammates when he gets back to the mainlands. However, Anne Marie finds out she may need Matt for the motivation and encouragement that she finds difficult to provide herself with, despite being highly-qualified and filled with talent.Blue Crush features some superbly photographed surfing scenes, shot with crisp, directorial command by Stockwell and made clear and evocative thanks to the cinematographical work of David Hennings. The final twenty minutes of the film are some of the most electric scenes of surfing I have yet to see, and work wonderfully in terms of shifting the focus away from what could be sentimental romance fluff into something truly breathtaking and original.At the end of the day, however, Blue Crush, while harmless, is also pretty simplistic; it's bears a very surface depiction of its characters despite not having the predictable pitfalls of its genre. Bosworth accentuates a nice charm, and the way that Stockwell and Weiss avoid the easier route is a commendable feat, on top of all the lush photography, but there's not enough drama that is gripping enough to invest in that doesn't seem oversimplified or voided by a lack of conversation in the film. Blue Crush serves as more intriguing basic entertainment than a great deal of other films made during or after its time, mainly due to the way it nicely avoids convention, yet there's still not a great deal of substance here outside of the fact that the predictably absorbing love interest doesn't monopolize the entire film on arrival.Starring Kate Bosworth, Matthew Davis, Michelle Rodriguez, Sanoe Lake, Mika Boorem, and Faizon Love.

Guilt oozes out of this epic and nothing about it is remotely entertaining. Jack Nicholson is terrific as Freddy Gale, a jewelry store owner and alcoholic who believes that he must exact vengeance on the drunken driver who struck his daughter Emily, but he is far from likable. I'd call this a film rather than a movie because you only need to watch it once to know you seen it one time too many. David Morse is just as good as the drunken driver who served time for vehicular homicide. These two men are filled with guilt, though they finally make up at the end with our protagonist finally visits his daughter's grave. As well made as The Crossing Guard is, it is not the kind of movie you want to see for the sake of sheer entertainment. All the technical credits are top-notch and the film never wears out its welcome. John Savage has a brief role near the beginning and then he vanishes. Robin Wright plays John Booth's momentary girlfriend who ends their relationship because she has too much trouble competing with his guilt. Robbie Robertson is good as the husband who replaced Freddy. Richard Bradford and Piper Laurie appear briefly at the beginning as John Booth's parents who come to pick him up at the prison when he gets out. Sean Penn's father Leo has a cameo, too. Skip this one unless you're feeling really terrible and need a purging.

It's less concerned with the actual trench warfare and more concerned with the sadism found in higher ranking officers. It's clear that Stanley isn't a fan of war, so it may be a little biased, but it is based on a true story and Stanley handles it absolutely beautifully!After the limp Killer's Kiss and entertaining, The Killing, Paths of Glory is Stanley's first truly great film. You can see his directing style really shine here with the fantastic tracking shots and wide angles. If you look at most films from the 50's you'll find that the camera barely moves. Here, the camera is always on the move which is partly why the film still holds up so well today.It's the type of film which makes your blood boil. There is no conventional happy ending, the entire film is on the road to tragedy. There are several brilliant scenes which stand the test of time including the storming of the Ant Hill, which adds a kind of surreal grace to a scene full of ugliness and intensity. Another great scene is the infuriating kangaroo court where Kirk Douglas hopelessly tries to defend the 'cowardly' soldiers.The most memorable moments are probably the final two scenes though. The first one features a long and melodramatic walk to the firing line. There's obvious religious imagery here and it's handled magnificently. The last scene is the famous moment in the bar where Stanley's beautiful wife takes the stage and gets a bunch of rowdy soldiers to hum in unison. It's a weirdly moving moment to end on.I'm not a particular fan of war films, but Paths of Glory has to be one of the best out there. It has a terrific story to tell and it's one which will anger and sadden you. It's superbly acted and directed too. Some say that it's Stanley Kubrick's best film. I'd disagree with that statement, but I can see where these people are coming from. It definitely has to be his most emotional and moving film.
