Just ask any married couple who've gone through it. It breaks up families. Its hell on the kids. But I think the worst part of divorce proceedings is that the whole act only reveals the ugly side of human nature. And Danny DeVito's The War of the Roses seems to understand that. Which is why its such a brilliant examination of marital bliss gone to hell. Its also an hilarious and merciless black comedy that spits and claws to the bitter end without ever holding back.The couple in this film are Oliver and Barbara Rose (Michael Douglas & Kathleen Turner). The story of their marriage and eventual split is told to us through their lawyer, Gavin D'Amato (DeVito). He is consulting with one of his clients about the pitfalls of ill-advised marriages. And the Roses are a perfect example.They first met at an auction. They were both bidding for the same item. And it turned into a fierce competition. Barbara won out, but it sparked the flames of desire, and before you knew it, the two fell madly in love. They eventually got married, bought a nice home, had two lovely children, a cat and a dog. And they lived happily ever...Hold it right there! That's not the story being told here. If it were, Danny DeVito would never have agreed to direct. Oh sure, things started off well. As they always do. But over time, the cracks started to appear, and before long there was trouble in paradise.Tiny details blossom into big problems. Oliver became a successful partner at his law-firm. But Barbara was stuck in the role of the dutiful housewife. Something that caused no end of frustration. Oliver is quite content with the way things are, and when Barbara tries to assert her independence, he's indifferent to her needs. Tiny things start out as minor irritations that become vehement hatred. Like Oliver's fake laugh at dinner parties. And Barbara embellishing details while telling a story. And when it looks like Oliver might die, Barbara is surprised to find she didn't care in the slightest. And one suspects, vice versa. That's the last straw. And so begins divorce proceedings.Its at this stage in the film where things really pick up steam. Oliver and Barbara refuse to leave their magnificent, opulent mansion. And it sets the stage for what will become a battlefield between the Roses. A fight that rotates between spite, barbs and eventually attempted murder.The War of the Roses is my favourite of all of Danny DeVito's black comedies. Because his direction here is so excellent and controlled. In some of his films, he has a tendency to overplay his hand to the point that what starts out pleasingly spiteful turns into unnecessarily farcical. Death to Smoochy was a particularly guilty offender.But that's not the case here. DeVito's direction is assured, and gradual. He allows things to build slowly and surely and he never deviates from that. The material is quite attuned to his sensibilities too, and he's served by two excellent performances from Michael Douglas and (especially) Kathleen Turner.DeVito made the canny choice of reuniting with his Romancing the Stone co-stars, because he understands their abilities, and he knew how well they would compliment each other. TWOTR is a complete polar opposite of RTS. Where that film had them as two different people who fall in love, this film has them as two people who start out in love and drift further and further apart.Douglas and Turner get right into their roles with pure, undiluted relish. They bring the same energy and enthusiasm that fired up a lot of Romancing the Stone, and watching their rivalries explode into violence provides us with a source of great entertainment.The part of an inattentive husband is something that Michael Douglas could play in his sleep. But he doesn't. He recognises the potential in the screenplay, and he plays straight to the hilt. He knows he's got great chemistry with Kathleen Turner, and the sparks that fly from the two are truly superb.Turner has an equal amount of fun. Playing the role with a real arch sensibility, she positively sizzles. Barbara increasingly comes to dominate the picture. The mansion is her domain. And she knows it. Turner doesn't fly into the OTT theatrics that scuppered her later film, Serial Mom. Her performance here is more subtle and grounded in reality. And the film is all the better for it.Mention should also be made of Danny DeVito's wonderful humour. He's not afraid to plumb the real depths of people going through a messy divorce. Physical violence is one thing. But DeVito goes even further than that. At the height of black humour, Oliver ruins a swish dinner party for Barbara's posh friends by peeing on the main course. And she returns the courtesy by turning his beloved dog into pate on a cracker.But TWOTR is more than just bitchy oneupmanship. It is a cautionary tale. Otherwise we wouldn't have DeVito pulling double-duty as the lawyer telling us the cold hard facts behind the bitchiness. And its this element that allows the film to transcend its origins to become a surprisingly powerful fable in its closing scenes. Like most divorces, there is no happy ending, and this one ends on a real downer. Kudos to Danny DeVito for having the courage to keep things harsh and fatalistic, instead of resorting to anodyne clichés at the end.The War of the Roses is fun, witty, gutsy and most of all true to life. And its an astounding rarity among black comedies. This one actually has something to say.

After 'The Seventh Seal' left me in absolute awe of its flawless beauty, 'Wild Strawberries,' released in the same year, did little to disappoint. Each and every frame is utterly perfect, and Bergman's hand so incredibly assured. Even in the most common situations &#150; a close-up of Dr. Isak Borg's face, for example &#150; the images on the screen seem to exude beauty; we see the character's aging, withered features and a sense of irreconcilable sadness lurking behind his eyes, and we, too, are crestfallen.'Wild Strawberries' stars Victor Sjöström, then 78, as Dr. Isak Borg, an aging professor who travels across the country from Stockholm to Lund to receive an honorary university degree. Sjöström himself was one of Sweden's greatest directors, no doubt a great influence upon Bergman, and he also directed 'Körkarlen The Phantom Chariot (1921),' among my favourite films of the silent era. As he makes the day-long car journey, Isak begins to re-evaluate his entire life, prompted by memories, daydreams and unsettling nightmares. His wife has passed away some years ago, the end to a somewhat frictional marriage, and now Isak is fully aware that his own minutes are slowly ticking away. In the truly frightening opening dream sequence, he finds himself in a deserted city, with an ominous blackness looming ominously over his lonely form, and the complete and utter silence leaving him only too aware of the frantic beating of his failing heart. Approaching a coffin that has toppled from a carriage into the street, Isak finds within it his own expressionless corpse.Accompanying Isak on his journey to Lund is his daughter-in-law, Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), who is currently facing marital problems with her husband and possesses a certain bitterness towards his father. The marriage between Marianne and Evald (Gunnar Björnstrand) is very much like that between Isak and his long-deceased wife, and one of Isak's final wishes is that he can convince his son not to make the very same mistakes that he did. Also along for the trip is young hitchhiker Sara (Bibi Andersson), who reminds Isak of his lost childhood love, and her two friends Anders and Viktor, who both love her. A bickering married couple whom they pick up after a car accident (played by Gunnel Broström and Gunnar Sjöberg) act as a cold reminder of Isak's many unhappy years with his wife, Karin (Gertrud Fridh).Considering the solemn subject matter, Bergman includes quite a few amusing moments in his film, many arising from Anders and Victor's childlike bickering over the existence of God. There is a genuine air of optimism infused throughout the story, and the ending &#150; though I thought it came all too soon &#150; is both gratifying and heartwarming. 'Wild Strawberries' is a beautiful tale of life, death and redemption, and nobody tells it more beautifully than Ingmar Bergman.

Was I the only one hoping to one day catch a glimpse of Dr. Claw's face? If you are chanting YES. YES. YES along with me, then you are already aware of my feelings with Disney's debacle of a feature film presentation. Now, this isn't to say that there weren't elements that I found entertaining (gosh, am I saying this...), but overall this seemed to forget the foundation that it was built upon &#150; even the perverse cameo at the end sent shivers up my spine. Where did the creators go wrong? Let's begin by saying that this was a concept, a cartoon, that Disney had no right placing their expensive hands into.I was hooked at the beginning surprisingly. Why? I wanted to see the birth of Gadget and the reason why Claw and him were always pitted against each other. I wanted to see the creation of good and evil, but after twenty minutes, I saw Disney do what they do best. Matthew Broderick nervously steps into a role that he obviously wasn't ready for. He plays Gadget himself, a bumbling security cop who dreams of being a police officer. Due to Rupert Everett's whining and obvious lack of knowledge of who Dr. Claw is, the two find themselves crossing each others paths at a bio-technology lab where a new form of artificial intelligence is being designed. There is a pretty girl\/scientist (played by Joely Fisher) whom John Brown (Broderick, pre-Gadget) pines for, but cannot win because he doesn't have the confidence to win her over. Well, we all know where this is headed next, and Disney lays it on thick as Broderick uses every torturous gadget in his disposal to eliminate ... not Dr. Claw, but a clone that is demolishing the city ... can he win? I can't give it away, though it would make you better film viewers if I just blurted the ending ... who would pay money for this plastic form of entertainment.Alright, characters &#150; there was no commentary on this film, so I only watched it once (thankfully!), but Broderick was the obvious stand out. He tried, I know I feel bad saying this, but he did try to bring some depth to this character. Gadget is a bumbling idiot &#150; but he has a good heart. I thought Broderick was a good choice personality wise, but he never took Gadget to that next cinematic level. I wanted to have the foundation of the cartoon, but then grow into a feature film that had heart and dedication. In this mere 78 minute short film, there was nothing. So, on one side we have Gadget (Broderick doing his best), then on the other side we have the worst Hollywood idea ever &#150; Rupert Everett as Dr. Claw. This was a hazard. This was Disney thinking they could take a enormously popular villain and give him a soul. This was Rupert needing to ham it up more than Broderick so that there was a share of the screen. There was no evil, there was no corruption, there was nothing that even faintly resembled the Claw that we grew up with. The henchman seemed more in tune than Everett. He wasn't funny, he wasn't sinister, he wasn't diabolical in any way. He was fluff, and that wasn't the Dr. Claw that I attempted to pay money to see. His portrayal was a disgrace to anyone that has ever even glanced at the cartoon. Arg, it makes me mad just to mention it in this review. Rupert Everett ruined Dr. Claw. Penny (Michelle Trachtenberg) seemed to follow the Everett style of Gadet-ing, but not following her character at all. Shouldn't there have been a prerequisite to see the cartoon prior to making the film. Oh, filmmakers, how I shun thee.I guess if one could literally pull themselves away from the hideous acting by Everett, the rest of the film just seemed raced and pushed. I was happy to see that it only lasted 78 minutes, and they did cover quite a bit of ground, but it just felt like they weren't willing to give the credit due to the cartoon. This was a cult cartoon, and to see Disney play for a younger audience, care nothing for the pre-existing older audience that grew up with Gadget, make jokes that seemed cliché, and bubble the bad guy. It was hard to watch. I was pleased with the script, the director tried to go dark with a really random Broderick attempting to play a darker, more fun character as Gadget's clone &#150; but overall this film just lacked the spunk from the cartoon. I wanted animation, I wanted excitement, I wanted an adventure that would befuddle Adams himself, but instead I had a story that seemed like it would be in the dollar bin within the week of its release.Overall, this film wasn't horrid. The story itself wasn't anything I could watch again, but their ability to not overextend the plot, made it for simple viewing. It was 78 minutes of filming that I didn't mind, but couldn't get myself to watch it again. I will forever hate Everett for what he did to Dr. Claw, I think Dr. Claw will forever hate Everett as well. His portrayal ruined this film. It knocked it to the ground with no opportunity to pick it up again. Broderick was watchable, but I don't think he was what this film needed. Inspector Gadget is a perfect example of what happens when Disney puts their hands into a project and is determined to ensure that children get laughs from semi-crass physical humor.

It's also a beautifully photographed film with distinctive Germanic-styled sets that make a strong bass counterpoint to the linear contours of the actors' faces and the scientific equipment that makes up Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory where he hopes to produce synthetic life out of the bodies of the dead. The film-makers have combined material from Mary Shelley's brilliant novel with elements of the popular theatrical version by John Balderston and the story of 19th Century grave-robbers Burke and Hare to create a film story full of grotesque details colored by powerful pathos.Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive; the name was changed from the book's Victor to Henry for no discernible reason, and the fiancé's friend is now named Victor) is the one doing the collecting, along with his deformed assistant Fritz (cult favorite Dwight David Frye). Mae Clarke is his fiancé Elizabeth and John Boles plays a humorously straight Victor. It's one of those old melodramatic conventions, reproduced from Shelly's novel, where the good girl has a good guy but unfortunately is in love with the bad guy, in this case Herr Doctor. There's got to be about a million stories with this set-up (I just saw one last week in Jesse James, with Tyrone Power as the villainous lover and Randolph Scott as the more good than the good guy protector dude), and I find it one of the film's more conventional and weaker aspects. Also objectionable to some extent is Frederick Kerr's Baron Frankenstein, who's supposed to be the source of the film's humor but just does not amuse modern audiences &#150; Whale improved at this type of humor in the second Frankenstein film and The Old Dark House. The audience's sympathy of the monster is handled more forcefully and directly in Bride, but one could argue it's actually stronger in the original film because of the relative subtlety. On an explicit level the film depicts Henry as a hero and the monster as a villain, but it's hard to imagine anyone hard-hearted enough to watch the film without pitying the monster. And a lot of this is particularly effective because of Karloff's profoundly dignified performance as much as it is the director's understated way of eliciting sympathy. First he's depicted in a horrific way, with 3 very effective close-ups of his face edited so that we get progressively closer to the monster. As long as the monster is captive in Frankenstein's castle he's frightening and dangerous, but as soon as he achieves freedom we start to see that he's only hurtful when confused or scared (something Dr. Pretorius makes explicit through dialog in Bride). The scene with the little girl, which was edited in a particularly unfortunate way in the original film's release (cutting off the scene before he throws her in the water leaves the scene open to sexual interpretations not intended by the film-makers), is particularly heartbreaking in its restored version. Karloff does use some noises that emphasize the animalistic aspects of the monster, but his face shows so much of the humanity that the contrast between the two is both pathetic and vaguely majestic. He truly is the King of Monsters, because he has so much dignity and yet everyone treats him as an animal. It does remind me of The Elephant Man, actually &#150; the monster's plight connects with us much more than Henry or certainly his emotionally remote fiancé because there's a universal human element there. Physicality and mentality are odd bedfellows; rarely do they march strictly in synch. Unfortunately the story has, on the explicit level, watered down Shelley's contemplation in this regard by giving him an abnormal criminal brain, suggesting a physical determinism behind his more immoral actions. But the story's strength is only mildly diluted by this token explanation for a situation that is truly inexplicable; that is to say the fact that we seem to be angels (or devils) placed in the bodies of dogs, that our physical existence with all its associated bodily functions and dysfunctions provides the absurd counterpoint to our intellectual and moral facilities. And this really is the central problem in Shelley's Modern Prometheus fable &#150; the question of man usurping the proper place of God is only a small part of this larger question. Since Whale and the writers have made the decision to make the monster incapable of speech in this first film, this theme is conveyed through Karloff's physical performance, one that rises to the level of the great artistry of Lon Chaney from the silent era. It's one of those rare performances where the effect is so powerful and iconic that it's near impossible to imagine another actor in the role. And it's something that every person should see, and not just absorb through the osmosis of public opinion and highlight scenes.

It's also a beautifully photographed film with distinctive Germanic-styled sets that make a strong bass counterpoint to the linear contours of the actors' faces and the scientific equipment that makes up Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory where he hopes to produce synthetic life out of the bodies of the dead. The film-makers have combined material from Mary Shelley's brilliant novel with elements of the popular theatrical version by John Balderston and the story of 19th Century grave-robbers Burke and Hare to create a film story full of grotesque details colored by powerful pathos.Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive; the name was changed from the book's Victor to Henry for no discernible reason, and the fiancé's friend is now named Victor) is the one doing the collecting, along with his deformed assistant Fritz (cult favorite Dwight David Frye). Mae Clarke is his fiancé Elizabeth and John Boles plays a humorously straight Victor. It's one of those old melodramatic conventions, reproduced from Shelly's novel, where the good girl has a good guy but unfortunately is in love with the bad guy, in this case Herr Doctor. There's got to be about a million stories with this set-up (I just saw one last week in Jesse James, with Tyrone Power as the villainous lover and Randolph Scott as the more good than the good guy protector dude), and I find it one of the film's more conventional and weaker aspects. Also objectionable to some extent is Frederick Kerr's Baron Frankenstein, who's supposed to be the source of the film's humor but just does not amuse modern audiences &#150; Whale improved at this type of humor in the second Frankenstein film and The Old Dark House. The audience's sympathy of the monster is handled more forcefully and directly in Bride, but one could argue it's actually stronger in the original film because of the relative subtlety. On an explicit level the film depicts Henry as a hero and the monster as a villain, but it's hard to imagine anyone hard-hearted enough to watch the film without pitying the monster. And a lot of this is particularly effective because of Karloff's profoundly dignified performance as much as it is the director's understated way of eliciting sympathy. First he's depicted in a horrific way, with 3 very effective close-ups of his face edited so that we get progressively closer to the monster. As long as the monster is captive in Frankenstein's castle he's frightening and dangerous, but as soon as he achieves freedom we start to see that he's only hurtful when confused or scared (something Dr. Pretorius makes explicit through dialog in Bride). The scene with the little girl, which was edited in a particularly unfortunate way in the original film's release (cutting off the scene before he throws her in the water leaves the scene open to sexual interpretations not intended by the film-makers), is particularly heartbreaking in its restored version. Karloff does use some noises that emphasize the animalistic aspects of the monster, but his face shows so much of the humanity that the contrast between the two is both pathetic and vaguely majestic. He truly is the King of Monsters, because he has so much dignity and yet everyone treats him as an animal. It does remind me of The Elephant Man, actually &#150; the monster's plight connects with us much more than Henry or certainly his emotionally remote fiancé because there's a universal human element there. Physicality and mentality are odd bedfellows; rarely do they march strictly in synch.

The premise of Die Hard 2 sounds somewhat similar with John McClane butting heads with evil gun-totting terrorists. The plot in this one, however, is somewhat more complicated then the original. The start of the movie is one big surprise, as the hero of the original movie kicks by getting his car towed away in a rather silly manner while waiting for his wife who should arrive by plane at the airport in a few hours, so jut by hanging around in the lobby, he sees two suspicious characters who sneak in into the luggage area, John follows and soon, the first of many gun fights, incredible stunts and near death situations arise and John tries to stop a terrorist plot that's related to an incoming drug baron. And Holly's also in a jam, since the terrorist hijacked the control tower at Dull's Airport and it's lights out, many planes fly around while slowly running out of fuel(it's tense but not as tense as I was expecting). Die Hard 2 is more of the same, really, however it's a more complex plot that does tend to drag a bit, while the original was more tense and active. Bruce Willis once again shines as he's the character that makes the movie worth watching, with his rude and sarcastic remarks, he's an average guy who has trouble dying and he still works here. Holy's character is given very little to do at all, I mean even the reporter she punched at the end of the first movie, gets more screen time then her. Allan, the cop who helped John at the Nakatomi Plaza, lends him a brief hand.

John Leguizamo is also there, but I don't even remember him involved in anything on this movie, apart from the moment where I spotted him.

It's pretty much a stylish fantasy action film, which some people didn't seem to understand. Most of the criticism seems to be directed at how precise Willis shoots and that he's apparently immune to bullets. But LMS isn't exactly meant to be nitpicked over as if it were some semi-documentary or biopic. Very early on the tone of the film is established, making the viewer understand that LMS is more to be enjoyed almost as a simple shoot-'em-up computer game. Of course, one needs to be a somewhat intelligent viewer or at least someone who has experience watching movies to grasp this simple fact. (I love people who review, for example, thrillers without having seen more than 10 of them altogether.) Yes, Willis is an anti-magnet for bullets while his own bullets seem to have divine power. So what. One person even objected that Willis squints like Eastwood. First of all, Eastwood is not the first man to squint, either on celluloid or in reality, i.e. he doesn't have exclusive copyright on squinting. Secondly, how else is Willis meant to play this character? As a wide-eyed gay ballerina? Should he sing and dance perhaps? Flirt with Walken?This movie is fun from beginning to end. Sure the plot is unbelievable, but this is a fantasy not a character study, and the story is at least interesting, which is more than I can say for so many overrated, critically acclaimed movies. It is of course absurd that Willis could possibly survive in the end; realistically, he should have been knocked off in the first 20 minutes. But shouldn't James Bond have died early on in Dr.No, too?The action scenes are dynamic, and even though it is almost implied that Willis is invulnerable, they are far from dull. After all, in how many westerns - acclaimed westerns - do Eastwood and others also play gun-totting shooters who are almost invincible? I do think, however, that Willis overdid it with his cool whisperings. Often his voice was barely audible. I don't see how any other characters could have understood him unless he was literally speaking into their ear-lobes. There is even a duel of the whisperers, which occurs when Walken and Willis meet for the first time. However, Alec Baldwin's cool whisperings are much worse - and very annoying.Another plus is the cast. No effeminate girls like Di Crapio or Damon to spoil this. Walken and Dern steal the show.

It's funny, brilliantly paced, full of some nice dialogue and really creates an atmosphere of luck and chance. Although Midnight Run has these things going for it, it'll often use them in a way that is frustrating &#150; merely to further and turn the situation around so that the hero character of Jack Walsh (De Niro) is able to get out of a tough situation.Midnight Run will often submit to flaws that seem to plague films from the 1980s (at least the ones I've seen) and these come in the form of tired dialogue and silly plot twists. After going through a list of phobias that he has; Walsh states to Jonathan (Grodin) that in a minute, he'll have 'fisto-phobia'. I can only assume fisto-phobia is the fear of getting punched in which case Jonathan already has it as do we all anyway. The character of Eddie Moscone (Pantoliano) is also reduced to one of those shouty shady characters who screams profanity down the phone whether he's happy or not. Along with the lack of consistent dialogue is the plot twists as I mentioned. I wasn't entirely sure of how the climax came about but all that I do know is that one minute Walsh is in custody and the next seemingly on his way to riches as he works with the police in trapping another character. How he went from position to position is still a little puzzling but this is what the film does; it turns the plot around just when Walsh needs it to.Along with this, further evidence happens during the film's first and second third. No, I do not think that a train attendant would have the list of every single passenger and their room number easily at hand; no, I do not think that Jack would sleep with his cabin's door unlocked; no, I do not think that his ex-wife would be so understanding after he turns up for the first time in nine years especially since I bet her police captain husband would have something to say when he discovers her aiding and abetting a fugitive. These are all really unrealistic things that pop up during Midnight Run and they do ruin the overall experience. You can't really let the film get away with it, can you? Apart from these inconsistent things, Midnight Run is still highly enjoyable and remains quite clever at times. There are frequent occurrences where small, simple things are done in a manner that makes them seem so much more complicated. Walsh shoots the rear blade of a helicopter causing it to twirl round and explode when really he just needed to shoot the sniper that was sticking out of the side. Another scene is where a character loses control of a car yet can't keep it on the road well enough even though there was a clear track ahead of him as a truck approached &#150; the script opts for the more dramatic option by having the car chorea off down a sandy hill and into trouble. Further examples happen near the end when multiple police cars fly all over the place whilst chasing down Walsh in a car. Lucky he was in a 4x4, eh? The film is definitely enjoyable but several little things let it down just when you start to enjoy yourself. I never took Jonathan as a criminal for one second and he's clearly too smart to have done what he did steal millions from a mob boss and give it to charity. The film also comes a little too close to farcical yet retains sensible humour for most of the time. The sequence where Jack and Jonathan rob the diner is funny as is the helicopter chase but Midnight Run still comes close to farce; namely when the police cars are chasing Jack and the little exchange on board the rickety old bi-plane.Most of the time, Midnight Run will feel like a cross between 'It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World' and an Auto Trader magazine advertisement but it does work. The film has heart as evident in the scene when Walsh visits his family (although the motivation is a little unexplained) and the ending gives us a feeling that these characters really have gone on a journey and consequently grown. Midnight Run is fast with the right blend of action and humour but don't expect too much in the form of brains.

So last night I was looking for a movie to watch and in my mom's collection I found Air Force One and I noticed that Harrison Ford was in it, so I figured I would give it a look. So I watched it and all I can say is American Propaganda much? Now I'm all American, don't get me wrong, I love my country, but this was a bit much and incredibly insulting. If we really had a president like James Marshall, played by Ford, I'd say America would be a very exciting place of nothing but none-stop action. The whole movie either took itself too seriously or then would get into an Arnold Schwartzenegger type of action movie where Ford would say that little one liner before the big climax. Oh, I loved the 25 endings of how they could keep the action going. Now I love action movies, don't get me wrong, but this story was just silly and unnecessary.President James Marshell is on the fight of stopping terrorism, Russian terrorism to be more specific. Well he boards his flight back to the states, Air Force One starts off well, but is quickly hijacked by Ivan Korshunov and his men, terrorists who want their General Radek released from prison in return for the passengers on board, which isn't good since I guess he was hard to capture and is a deadly terrorist. Ivan makes threats to kill of the passengers every half hour if the vice president does not meet his demands. But the President does not chicken out, he stays on board and will fight these terrorists and win back the plane.Air Force One is non-stop action with a mixture of the hit TV show West Wing. Like I said, I don't mind an action movie, sometimes I love the most cliché'd one's, but not when it comes to serious stuff like terrorism, but I think I'm speaking from a post 9\/11 view, so maybe if I saw this movie a before then, I wouldn't have mind it that much, but even then, there were moments that were terribly over acted and for me, it just didn't work for having a president like James Marshall, please, I wish.

However the subject he explores and the tale he tells to us viewers this time round is much more unsettling and much less lighthearted than many of his mainstream movies.I first bought Rashomon on DVD a few years ago as I had just recently became a big Kurosawa fan after having watched several of his most influential works including Ikiru (1952), The Hidden Fortress (1958) and not to mention Seven Samurai (1954). All of which had ranked well among my favourite films of all time. So I thus had to check out more. And this was recommend to me and being a fan of Murder Mysteries the plot's summary excited me.Set in 17th century Japan, Rashomon tells the dark tale of a vicious confrontation between a ruthless bandit (Kurosawa regular Toshiro Mifune), a wealthy samurai (Masayuki Mori) and his beautiful wife (Machiko Kyo) during which the husband is killed and his body discovered by a local woodcutter (Another regular Takashi Shimura).However upon going to trial all four testifier's, including the bandit, the wife, the dead man (speaks through a local medium) and the woodcutter each give four completely different accounts of what actually happened that fateful day and which make no connection whatsoever with the last.Who is telling the truth? Is only one of them being honest? Are they all lying in order to present themselves in a good light? Or are they all lying to deliberately cover something up?

However the subject he explores and the tale he tells to us viewers this time round is much more unsettling and much less lighthearted than many of his mainstream movies.I first bought Rashomon on DVD a few years ago as I had just recently became a big Kurosawa fan after having watched several of his most influential works including Ikiru (1952), The Hidden Fortress (1958) and not to mention Seven Samurai (1954). All of which had ranked well among my favourite films of all time. So I thus had to check out more. And this was recommend to me and being a fan of Murder Mysteries the plot's summary excited me.Set in 17th century Japan, Rashomon tells the dark tale of a vicious confrontation between a ruthless bandit (Kurosawa regular Toshiro Mifune), a wealthy samurai (Masayuki Mori) and his beautiful wife (Machiko Kyo) during which the husband is killed and his body discovered by a local woodcutter (Another regular Takashi Shimura).However upon going to trial all four testifier's, including the bandit, the wife, the dead man (speaks through a local medium) and the woodcutter each give four completely different accounts of what actually happened that fateful day and which make no connection whatsoever with the last.Who is telling the truth? Is only one of them being honest? Are they all lying in order to present themselves in a good light? Or are they all lying to deliberately cover something up?

The other two are Where Eagles Dare and Kelly's Heroes. This one is a strong morality tale exploring the dangers of the two extremes of justice, vigilante justice and a court of no appeal, with no checks and balances. There's also romance, great scenery, conflict, and a fairly well written screenplay. I've seen a lot of criticism over the years of Clint Eastwood's acting ability, mainly centering on his supposed lack of facial expression. I just think that's a load of B.S., expressed by people who don't know how to read emotions in another person's eyes, or can't be bothered to look. I'd much rather watch an actor like Clint, John Wayne, or Bruce Willis, who make me pay attention to such subtleties, than watch one who mugs for the camera, and exaggerates every expression. Or one like Gary Cooper, who knew how to express himself with his face without overdoing it. Anyway, this is vintage Clint Eastwood and belongs in every true fan's collection. Or the collection of fans of Westerns, or anyone who just believes in true justice.

The set up is that it is an exploration of the machinations behind the scenes of a real estate sales firm. Now right there I can sense a starting point for some serious moral conflicts, the lying, deceit, double crossing, double talking, and flat out inhumanity of the salesmen against their clients, and also against each other... And yet there was very little of that... Then came the *spoilers* robbery plot... a 10 minute discussion Moss and Aaronow, only to have Levine get in on it in the end, sure it was a nice little surprise, but where was the development of his character to that point? The phone calls, I guess, were supposed to accomplish that, and yet I had to watch it twice to figure out that his daughter was in the hospital and he needed money for something... that should have been more fleshed out. Then Moss's character, high impact from the start, stealing whatever scene he is in, and there's nothing with him...Lastly, was Roma... his deal with Lingk had everything, the intro, the sell, the gradual luring in of Lingk, Roma slowly attaching one claw after another onto Lingk until he falls hook line and sinker, only to have a crisis of conscience, which opens the door for Roma's double talking, lying, word-twisting, misdirection, sell his mother to avoid losing the sale situation, and what... it's crammed right into the middle of the police investigation sequence... It should have become the only thing going on on the screen, but no, it shared the screen with the po-po... and thus its impact was lost.All in all, it had a lot of potential. If they had opened up the film, explored Moss and Levine's characters more, and then put Roma's situation front and center when it was happening, the film could have been truly great... and yet it wasn't. Boiler Room, while about the same in quality, showcased the evilness of the sales industry much better. GGR had slightly better writing and performances, BR had better plot development.
