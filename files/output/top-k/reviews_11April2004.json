The MacGuffin was that of meaningless intrigue, as when men die for the sake of a tune in The Lady Vanishes - a tune whose relevance and importance is of no knowledge to them, and exists merely as an excuse for a greater picture.A greater picture indeed. In The 39 Steps, Hitchcock's MacGuffin is presented early on, much to the ignorance of the casual viewer, who will no doubt pass over its significance without so much as a thought. Then, the MacGuffin transforms into another key element of the story. By the end of the film, we get the basic idea of what is going on, but the purpose for its existence in the first place is never fully explained - nor does it need to be.Hitchcock's own cynicism towards his `MacGuffins' is clearly evident in most interviews where he suffers through explaining their definitions yet once more. But author Eric Rhode explains, `It would be as foolish to take Hitchcock's cynicism on its face value as it would be to accept François Truffaut's view that Hitchcock elaborates a philosophy of the absurd of it. Genuine anxieties and genuine intuitions do emerge in his filming.'These anxieties appear in full during the course of The 39 Steps, Hitchcock's early British masterpiece from 1935. Perhaps one of the first examples of the `buddy comedy' genre to later be fulfilled by Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987, John Hughes) and Midnight Run (1988, Martin Brest), The 39 Steps is a simple story that is technically flawed and yet structurally perfect. Arguably Hitchcock's most popular film of the 1930s (closely rivaled by The Lady Vanishes 1938), The 39 Steps is a reason to return to his older films and marvel at their utter simplicity and wonder. For a film released in 1935, filmed with a low budget and a somewhat low-key cast, The 39 Steps is still relatively well-paced and interesting, and should wet the appetite of most mystery lovers - especially those who think the classics aren't `any good.' If you are interested in `weaning' yourself onto older motion pictures, this is a good start, and still one of the finest films you will ever encounter on your quest. In this case, Hitchcock's MacGuffin is inadvertently stumbled across by a Canadian man on vacation in England. His name is Richard Hannay (played by Robert Donat), and his presence is never given a backdrop. A lesser director might employ the unnecessary fifteen-minute opening that sets up the character, his flaws, his quirks, his reasons for visiting England. Instead, Hitchcock does something just short of brilliant by introducing the character to us from the very start, halfway through his journey, and by doing so therefore lets us judge him on our own standards, without having forced opinions crammed down our throats. Unjustly accused of murder after being told of the `thirty-nine steps' by a female spy who is assassinated inside his apartment, Hannay flees into the British landscape, taking along a beautiful hostage named Pamela (Madeleine Carroll), who is eager to escape, but soon falls for the Canadian and believes his self-proclaimed innocence to be the truth.What is the MacGuffin of the story? In short, we never really know. To spoil the ending would ruin the entire film, but in a nutshell, Hannay himself becomes the MacGuffin, as he is the victim being pursued by men who are not aware of who he is, or what he knows. Hannay is the story's connecting thread to all of the following events, and the end presents us with two separate MacGuffins, in a sense Hannay and the realization of why he has been chased up unto this point. Hitchcock does not use his typical MacGuffins here - the characters, and what they know, and why they know what they know, and why their pursuers want to know what they know, is the theme - or the MacGuffin, depending on how you want to interpret it.Quentin Tarantino used the MacGuffin ploy in Pulp Fiction fifty-nine years later - what was in the briefcase? No one knew, and it was not important - the idea of the briefcase was all that mattered, and its presence was what compelled the characters to try and achieve it.  We learned to realize that by revealing nothing, Tarantino was actually thereby offering our minds room to think for a change. To reveal the MacGuffin would ruin the entire theory - some of us might find it to be a worthy object and I am sure that many of us would consider it to be a waste of time. Instead, we react to the haze of light that shoots out of the briefcase whenever it is opened, and our curiosity grows as we see each and every character that encounters the case stare in awe at its presumably marvelous contents.Hitchcock could be credited for starting this entire trend of less-is-more cinema. He perfected the sense of mystery in Psycho (1960), which completely startled audiences across the world, setting up two oft-mixed genres of serial killers and split personalities. (It also spawned three inferior sequels, two of which were passable but all of which failed to realize that the subtlety of Psycho is what propelled it, not the exploitation present in its offspring.)In The 39 Steps, the MacGuffin is more clear than usual, but the relevance of the MacGuffin itself to those who need it is what we are never sure of - and that is why the mystery is never truly explained, and is miles ahead of many other films that try, and fail, to imitate its success.5\/5 stars.- John Ulmer ","genre":null},{"date":"11 April 2004","score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":"  According to Hitchcock, the MacGuffin was a phrase devised from Kipling that was used to cover any plot curiosity or unexplainable necessity; the unattainable object that must be attained, or the mysterious device that must be discovered.

Taken that Unforgiven is the last Western that Clint Eastwood has done so far and is one of the best that he has ever made.   As there has been a shortage of Westerns since the seventies it was good to see Unforgiven when it came along in 92 and much more rewarding that it was directed by Eastwood himself as well as starring in it also.   I think this was really a goodbye message to all the Eastwood and western fans saying that I'm to old for this and this is me hanging my boots up.   The story is about retired gunfighter William Munny who has a bigger reputation in the West than Hitler, as everyone who comes across his name had something to say about his past and not a bit of it was good.   It felt that William Munny was really The Man with No Name who has now settled down and wanted to live his life peacefully as a pig farmer.   I don't know whether these were really hidden messages or I am just talking a load of old tosh but when you watch it makes you think and I am really talking about the ending of the film where Gene Hackman who plays Bill is celebrating with his cowboy friends on the eve of them going out to find Eastwood and his men already remembering already that he has tortured and killed his friend Ned played by Morgan Freeman.   When William Munny strolls into the bar and everybody begins to notice him you have this tingling feeling that The Man with No Name has just come in and is about to wage war like he did in his previous films.  Obviously this is a different character and when Eastwood does make an appearance unannounced we get to see the William Munny everybody talks about throughout the film.   It is an intense moment and he just does it with pure action hero written all over it.

You see the don't care look in Munny's eyes and Bill says `I'll see you in Hell William Munny' and in classic Clint Eastwood style he just replies `Yeah' and I was just amazed and felt like I was watching him all over again the Spaghetti Western trilogy.  It was just breath taking to see him like that again.The music score which was written by Eastwood himself is as beautiful as any film score is going to get and the cinematography and direction is just remarkable.

","genre":"Action, Drama"},{"date":"11 April 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"       7 out of 10     Agreeable, easygoing actioner detailing a motley group of eleven very different guys brought together to a rob a highly secure casino in Las Vegas.     This is a remake of the 1960 original that starred Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.  This one is far, far better.  Of course that film was so boring it is hard to believe that a remake could be any worse.  That film did not concentrate on the robbery itself, but instead just relied upon ol' blue eyes and Dino mugging for the camera.  This one is much more focused on the heist, which is elaborate and once it gets going even exciting.  They also do not fill you in on the complete plan and therefore gives the viewer some real neat intricate twists to the heist as it progresses.      The real drawback to it is just the fact that it seems virtually impossible to pull off especially with the way that they do it.  The fact that they do it with such ease really hurts the tension level.  It also gets a bit too exaggerated and hi-tech.  At times it almost seems more like an espionage film than a caper flick.     The comraderie amongst the group is one of the film's better elements.  No one is overly obnoxious and no one is so cool that they can't be touched.  These guys are slick, but they can still get nervous and display other vulnerabilities.   There is also some genuine concern and support for each other.  There is even some snappy exchanges although there could have been and should have been a lot more.     It is also nice that it breaks the age barrier and incorporates old timers Reiner and Gould into the fold.  Gould is pretty much wasted, but at least it's nice seeing him back doing movies that are released to the theatre and not just to your local video store shelf.  Although I must say his oversized Harry Carey glasses are awful and not even good for laughs.  Reiner is good because he proves here that he can actually act as well as write and direct.  The ethnic accent he uses isn't bad.     The character of the casino owner who gets robbed is a interesting one.  He is a man that carries everything out with a precision and is apparently quite sadistic and violent if he feels you betrayed him.  He is written as kind of  'untouchable' character with a mystic like the one in THE USUAL SUSPECTS.

This is a remake of the 1960 original that starred Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.  This one is far, far better.  Of course that film was so boring it is hard to believe that a remake could be any worse.  That film did not concentrate on the robbery itself, but instead just relied upon ol' blue eyes and Dino mugging for the camera.

The real drawback to it is just the fact that it seems virtually impossible to pull off especially with the way that they do it.  The fact that they do it with such ease really hurts the tension level.  It also gets a bit too exaggerated and hi-tech.  At times it almost seems more like an espionage film than a caper flick.     The comraderie amongst the group is one of the film's better elements.  No one is overly obnoxious and no one is so cool that they can't be touched.

There is even some snappy exchanges although there could have been and should have been a lot more.     It is also nice that it breaks the age barrier and incorporates old timers Reiner and Gould into the fold.  Gould is pretty much wasted, but at least it's nice seeing him back doing movies that are released to the theatre and not just to your local video store shelf.  Although I must say his oversized Harry Carey glasses are awful and not even good for laughs.  Reiner is good because he proves here that he can actually act as well as write and direct.  The ethnic accent he uses isn't bad.     The character of the casino owner who gets robbed is a interesting one.  He is a man that carries everything out with a precision and is apparently quite sadistic and violent if he feels you betrayed him.

In short, if you like action\/adventure films that actually have some action or adventure, and enjoy watching characters that have more than one dimension, avoid this tremendously disappointing dog.  This is a movie for hard-core Trekkies ONLY!

The gateway to a so-called Hell, a corpse hanging by hooks and Dr. Weir's brand new demonic look, its Hellraiser in space! And plus this has already been done. I think that this story could have gone in so many different directions but in the end the writer basically got bored and used a better films plot. I suggest if you are thinking about watching this film get HellraiserBloodlines instead, the plots better and its set in space too. Plus, it won't let you down like the HUGE meat grinder room that wasn't used, what a mistake! Good idea, already been done.

It was nice that there was no bad guy, or have Stallone's character as the ageing racer who comes back to win the World Title (not very believable!).     Looking at some comments for Driven and for other Sly movies on the IMDB it seems to me that many folks just have a downer on Stallone and trash everything he does due to their own prejudices.  If you dislike him then why watch his films?  The Worst movie ever made?  Give me a break.

He feels he has lost his gift for stringing together eloquent sentences and yearns for some sort of inspiration to rid him of his horrible writer's block.  William then meets the lovely and royal Viola, who is craving to be an actress.  She becomes his muse, as well as the lead `actor' in his new play Romeo and Juliet, as they weave a tangled love affair.  This burning passion they feel can only end with separation when Viola is forced to marry Lord Wessex and move to America.  This film is a wonderful combination of romance, comedy, and drama that attempts a new perspective of the classic Romeo and Juliet story.  It employs clever dialogue, beautiful scenes, and wonderful characterization to entertain the viewer. The film's Renaissance dialogue is true to its time period.  With such an excellent script, William comes across as the master of speech that he really is.  Some parts of the movie are purely funny as almost to parody the seriousness of Romeo and Juliet. Other parts intertwine the actual lines from the play, such as the multiple bedroom scenes between Will and Viola, to provide a unique and obvious parallel between it and the movie.  When Will quotes `Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?' to Viola, this provides not only a sentimental scene but actual words from Shakespeare to add to the historical content of this film.   This film has an interesting twist on the tragic tale because Will becomes not just a writer pouring out the lines for pay, but a man pouring out his heart in true love.  At the end of the movie, Romeo and Juliet is presented as though you were actually sitting on the dirt floor of the playhouse.  You see the play through the eyes of a person in England during the late 1500's, except by this time the lead is not longer Romeo and Juliet but literarily and symbolically Will and Viola. The setting of this film is very well done, and the playhouses, taverns, and elegant houses convey the feeling of Renaissance England.  The costumes, including Queen Elizabeth's glamorous dresses and Viola's body-shaping corset,  are seemingly accurate.  (I would have hated wearing those clothes!)  The scenes between Will and Viola are rarely anything but love scenes, and they, like their counterpart scenes in Romeo and Juliet, mostly happen at night.  This adds to the mystery and forbidden feeling of the movie.  The characterization of this film was splendidly carried out.  I could not help but fall in love with the beautiful emotion that gushed from Will and Viola ( Will is extremely good looking by the way).  When the couple was separated in the end, I felt like a terrible wrong had been committed.  The character of Queen Elizabeth, with her snide comments and all-knowing attitude, was a comical representation of a serious position that kept me completely entertained.  Christopher Marlowe also provides a wonderful character that conveys `real person' qualities of competition between two famous playwrights. I found this film to be completely engaging from start to finish, but I would not recommend it to everyone.  I believe it could truly be given the title of `chick flick' by some viewers despite its fight scenes and comedic devices.  The viewer will gain a knowledge of the Renaissance period and its characteristics while also getting the feeling of knowing the great William Shakespeare, however inaccurate the description of Will may be.  I feel that now I appreciate the play Romeo and Juliet with a new sense of understanding that can only come from looking at an old tale in a new light.
