My perspective about life has changed after watching this movie. This may not be a biographical movie, but the lessons this movie has given me is priceless. By the end of the movie, you will be both in tears of sadness and smiling in joy at the same time - such is the power of the movie.The movie is set during the World War II period surrounding a Jewish Italian man. This man, this character, will change the way you look at life. I never thought a serious War Drama movie could make one laugh, but because of the hilarious comedy scenes, this movie is it.Even in dire times, like in the labour camps during that time, this man - Guido - could keep his sense of humour and optimistic approach. Roberto Benigni played the role and also directed the movie. He was so, so good, I can not express in words - no-one can. I can't possibly fathom how he played such a difficult role with so much ease. A truly deserving Oscar.If you are going through a not-so-good period in life, then you have got to watch this movie - it will change your life forever. And if you are going through a period when you think life is beautiful, then you still got to watch this movie so that it will solidify your thoughts.This is the joint-greatest movie I have watched along with Schindler's List.

I loved every minute of that series and remember the events and journey of Cathy, Chris, Cory and Carrie to this day.When the movie first came out in 1987, my sister &#x96; another huge influence on my childhood &#x96; just had to take me to the movie. Not that I was complaining; 1987 was just when I grew and fell in love with movies (my passion for cinema would only grow tenfold from there.)Since we were both familiar with the story of the flowers in the attic, we walked away disappointed and felt betrayed.

That horrible, terrible, misplaced, no good and actually laughable climax.I believe I saw the movie just shy of a handful of times later on home video, but not for twenty years would I watch it again. 2014 announced to me a Lifetime (TV) film version of this and it sparked my interest into seeing this again after two decades away from Foxworth Hall and the Four Cs.Okay, the movie was very 80s, and had some way overacting &#x96; namely by Kristy Swanson and that ending &#x96; Oh, dear God, that misleading, incorrect and unintentionally hilarious finale &#x96; was just as awful. But, I must say the movie still held true (for the most part) to the original idea behind the V.C. Andrews story.Yes, they changed details, events and made it, incredibly, less violent, claustrophobic and shorter than the events in the book, but the key plot points and motivations were present. And Director\/Writer Jeffrey Bloom did all he could to bring a phenomenal book to about 90 minutes of footage. Still not sure how he came up with the last few minutes, though I suspect studio interference for that blunder.The story revolves around four young siblings who get locked up in a room\/attic while their recently widowed mother fights for the love of her dying rich father from which she previously fell from grace. Mother's visits to her eventually neglected children become scarce as the weeks and months go by, but they have more to worry about as their hyper-religious and angry Grandmother's punishments increase.With that synopsis, I only touched on the tip of the iceberg with this tale of suspense, love, hope, horror, danger, yearning, greed, despair and future.

With that said I do know enough about it to know that it is essentially about how revenge can backfire badly. While I knew this version wasn't accurate I decided to sit down and watch it anyway... And BOY was it stupid.The plot is that Edmond Dantes is a sailor and his captain has fallen into a coma. When going on an island where Napoleon is kept prisoner and marooned on, Napoleon asks Edmond to give a letter to a friend assuring that it's contents are purely innocent and... He believes him! This is the guy who tried to conquer Europe and Edmond simply takes his word for it. When he gets back after the Captain dies he becomes Captain but the first mate at the time, named Danglar is upset because of it and it's also revealed he is going to be married to a beautiful woman who loves him named Mercedes, however a count named Mondego also has his eyes on Mercedes.If you know the story you'll know what happens, Edmond gets arrested fro conspiring with Napoleon. Which in another version I watched, it seems absurd. Here, it seems justified. Why? How about he takes the word of a fascist dictator without question? When the prosecutor looks at the letter (which has information that can jeopardize Napoleons Capture) and Dantes says he's innocent... He believes him! Then it's also found out that the letter was meant to be delivered to the prosecutors father. So Dantes has instead gone to a prison on it's own separate island. After years he meets a priest (played by Richard Harris) who is trying to dig to the sea wall, strange because how he enters is by digging up through the stones in the floor.So they dig out together for escape while the priest teaches Edmond everything he knows. They continue digging and the priest dies after some rocks fall on him when they get close. Dantes then escapes by switching the priest with himself inside the body-bag. He is then picked up by Italian smugglers who he joins. When he goes back to his hometown he finds out that Mercedes left him one month later for Mondego, Danglar owns the fishing establishment he was a part of and the prosecutor is now chief prosecutor. So he decides to recover some old treasure the priest told him about and he uses that to assume the identity of the Count Of Monte Cristo to take revenge.One thing I hated was the ending. I know enough to work out the moral of The Count Of Monte Cristo is that revenge on someone can also hurt other people who know very little if anything about what is going on... Here they slap on a happy ending. I'm not kidding, Mondego's son is completely fine with Edmond killing the man that raised him because after almost 20 years he shows up out of nowhere and his mother claims he is Edmond's biological son. So that makes it okay? Again I have to complain about the utter stupidity of Edmond. He takes a letter from a fascist dictator and takes his word that it's for a friend and the contents have nothing to do with something like people giving him an escape and he just takes his word for it. When it's revealed Mondego read the letter I was only a few steps away from starting to root for the bad guys.The acting is also pretty bad. I know a lot of people like him but Guy Pearce does nothing for me as an actor and Jim Caviezel somehow plays it both over the top and under the bottom. The only 2 that managed to convince me that they could actually act were Richard Harris and Dagmara Dominczyk.So in all honesty, This movie was too stupid to get me invested in anything. The cinematography and the music are pretty good but that's about it. If you liked this movie, that is perfectly fine. I personally prefer the 1975 TV movie adaptation starring Richard Chamberlain and directed by David Greene. If you didn't like this version of the story then I suggest checking the '75 version out.

I know enough to work out the moral of The Count Of Monte Cristo is that revenge on someone can also hurt other people who know very little if anything about what is going on... Here they slap on a happy ending. I'm not kidding, Mondego's son is completely fine with Edmond killing the man that raised him because after almost 20 years he shows up out of nowhere and his mother claims he is Edmond's biological son. So that makes it okay? Again I have to complain about the utter stupidity of Edmond. He takes a letter from a fascist dictator and takes his word that it's for a friend and the contents have nothing to do with something like people giving him an escape and he just takes his word for it. When it's revealed Mondego read the letter I was only a few steps away from starting to root for the bad guys.The acting is also pretty bad. I know a lot of people like him but Guy Pearce does nothing for me as an actor and Jim Caviezel somehow plays it both over the top and under the bottom. The only 2 that managed to convince me that they could actually act were Richard Harris and Dagmara Dominczyk.So in all honesty, This movie was too stupid to get me invested in anything. The cinematography and the music are pretty good but that's about it. If you liked this movie, that is perfectly fine. I personally prefer the 1975 TV movie adaptation starring Richard Chamberlain and directed by David Greene. If you didn't like this version of the story then I suggest checking the '75 version out. ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"20 January 2014","score":"","review":" Okay let me get one thing perfectly clear, I have never read the original novel. With that said I do know enough about it to know that it is essentially about how revenge can backfire badly. While I knew this version wasn't accurate I decided to sit down and watch it anyway... And BOY was it stupid.The plot is that Edmond Dantes is a sailor and his captain has fallen into a coma. When going on an island where Napoleon is kept prisoner and marooned on, Napoleon asks Edmond to give a letter to a friend assuring that it's contents are purely innocent and... He believes him! This is the guy who tried to conquer Europe and Edmond simply takes his word for it. When he gets back after the Captain dies he becomes Captain but the first mate at the time, named Danglar is upset because of it and it's also revealed he is going to be married to a beautiful woman who loves him named Mercedes, however a count named Mondego also has his eyes on Mercedes.If you know the story you'll know what happens, Edmond gets arrested fro conspiring with Napoleon. Which in another version I watched, it seems absurd. Here, it seems justified. Why? How about he takes the word of a fascist dictator without question? When the prosecutor looks at the letter (which has information that can jeopardize Napoleons Capture) and Dantes says he's innocent... He believes him! Then it's also found out that the letter was meant to be delivered to the prosecutors father. So Dantes has instead gone to a prison on it's own separate island. After years he meets a priest (played by Richard Harris) who is trying to dig to the sea wall, strange because how he enters is by digging up through the stones in the floor.So they dig out together for escape while the priest teaches Edmond everything he knows. They continue digging and the priest dies after some rocks fall on him when they get close. Dantes then escapes by switching the priest with himself inside the body-bag. He is then picked up by Italian smugglers who he joins. When he goes back to his hometown he finds out that Mercedes left him one month later for Mondego, Danglar owns the fishing establishment he was a part of and the prosecutor is now chief prosecutor. So he decides to recover some old treasure the priest told him about and he uses that to assume the identity of the Count Of Monte Cristo to take revenge.One thing I hated was the ending.

This is a damn good film, make no mistake about it. You can definitely tell Steven Spielberg is involved. Nobody can create a movie quite like he can. The story is simple but extremely effective. The scares are delivered (That eerie clown, brrrr) , the suspense is always there, but the most important element of this movie is the cohesiveness of the Freeling family. Not only are they a very strong unit but everyone is likable. They band together during the time of adversity, no matter what. That is what family is supposed to be all about. Hell, even I would help this family. It delivers great buildup, until the finale is turned up several notches. Speaking of the finale, I do think it went on a tad too long. It was never boring and always exciting, but it felt a bit contrived after the false ending. Part of me wonders if they should have stopped there. They went for one too many climaxes. Spielberg pulls it off extremely well, I just wonder if he got pressured to add more thrills and scares. I'm probably being too picky. I really did enjoy the last 15 minutes. It is actually the scariest part of the movie, it just felt needless. Craig T. Nelson makes a terrific Dad. Vulnerable, yet strong-willed at the same time. Jobeth Williams is sexy and a great actress. This woman conveys all her emotions perfectly, especially the trauma she endures with her missing daughter. Heather O'Rourke is fantastic as Carol Anne.

Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump who basically tells his life stories to people on a park bench around the bus stop. His life stories include the Vietnam war, genius Ping Pong skills, being in the All American football team, meeting President Kennedy, great running, making friends, falling in love with a childhood friend and being in a great shrimp company. We see his life story as flashbacks and we enjoy them, of course. I've never seen a movie quite like Forrest Gump. This movie made me laugh, cry and warmed my heart. Robin Wright portrays Jenny, Forrest's best friend since they were six years old and Sally Field is fantastic as Forrest's wise and caring mother. But the character that is considered to be my favorite character is Gary Sinise as Lt. Dan, who was with Forrest and the rest of the troops during the war. At first, his character's lifestyle made me feel sad, but later on Lt. Dan thanks Forrest for saving his life and enjoyed life as it is. Forrest saved his life during the war and later on, he had to be amputated. This movie is one of my personal favorites and Robert Zemeckis' best film that he directed. The ending works out perfect too. Forrest is at the park bench because he's meeting Jenny and an elderly woman tells him that the apartment she lives in, is just around the corner. Forrest hops out of his seat and manages to find Jenny and also finds out that he is the cause of Jenny's 8 year old son. Afterwards, Forrest and Jenny get married and Lt. Dan shows up at the wedding with his new fiancée. Now we see that Lt. Dan is stabled and has changed his life. Later on, Jenny tells Forrest that she has an unrecognizable virus. At first I thought that it was because of Jenny's bad decisions in the past. And then Jenny passed away of sexually transmitted diseases. We later see Forrest talking to Jenny's grave and promising her that he will take care of their son... And he does. I have to be honest with you, when I first saw Forrest Gump, I was disappointed because of Jenny's death, but then I saw it again and I love it. I now realize that it was meant to be. She can't just live, knowing that she made risky and bad decisions. But the movie still had a heartwarming and sweet ending, involving Forrest saying goodbye to his son, who is going to school. This beautiful scene reminds me of Forrest's first day at school. And as Forrest says goodbye, the feather that he collected at the start of the film, flew out of the Curious George book and it took us away from a film that is built to perfection.

Not only does this have pretty funny one-liners, there is an ample amount of physical comedy such as when Matt Perry keeps on running into doors or Michael Clarke Duncan himself.Jonathan Lynn's film is about a dentist named Oz who lives unhappily with his wife.

Oz, meanwhile, is in Chicago so he will be able to rat out Jimmy to his former boss setting the stage for some rather hilarious consequences.The acting is very good.

The premise of the film has been praised for its originality, but these ideas are nothing new. The idea of robots holding power over man has been used in almost every work of science fiction ever written. The idea of this world being a dream is nothing new either. The earliest use of this idea I'm aware of is one of Shakespeare's poems, and I'm sure even he wasn't the first to use this idea. Nothing happens in the film. There is no real plot.

Neo is unconfident, and then suddenly he's tough and ready to handle anything. No transition happens. I never found myself caring about Neo. Part of this is because he is played by Keanu Reeves, who is arguably the most boring actor under the sun, with one facial expression and forced way of speaking dialogue. Neo is not written as an interesting character. He has no personality whatsoever, and no virtues to make you respect him. As I said before, when he does change it comes out of nowhere.

The idea of robots holding power over man has been used in almost every work of science fiction ever written. The idea of this world being a dream is nothing new either. The earliest use of this idea I'm aware of is one of Shakespeare's poems, and I'm sure even he wasn't the first to use this idea. Nothing happens in the film. There is no real plot. Neo finds out about the Matrix, leaves it, Morpheus is kidnapped, and that's it. Nothing happens. No lesson is learned, and any character development is not believable. Neo is unconfident, and then suddenly he's tough and ready to handle anything. No transition happens. I never found myself caring about Neo. Part of this is because he is played by Keanu Reeves, who is arguably the most boring actor under the sun, with one facial expression and forced way of speaking dialogue. Neo is not written as an interesting character. He has no personality whatsoever, and no virtues to make you respect him. As I said before, when he does change it comes out of nowhere. None of the other characters are particularly interesting either. However, the visual effects and action sequences are good to watch, and thus I was a bit distracted from the weak story, characters, and unoriginal ideas.

In the distance, several men appear riding along on thundering horseback, like a dark storm cloud they are menacing in nature as they roll through the picturesque landscape. They are employees of a bigger gold mining company who have come to raise hell, and to frighten these small time tin panners into giving up their rightful (i.e. legal) claim to the land. After the havoc they provoke, a young girl living in the mining camp kneels down to pray for a miracle. In faded transitions emerging through the snow we see Clint Eastwood in long shot on horseback, seemingly the answer to her prayers.This brilliant opening sets the tone for what ends up being one of Eastwood's finest Westerns, and one of his very best efforts behind the camera as a director. I'm not sure if it was Francois Truffaut who said that a film should not be reviewed until it has been seen at least three times. I'm not even sure if that is the actual quote. As this was my first viewing of Pale Rider, I'm hesitant to write about it so soon because of how moved I was by it, even though I feel my affection for it will only increase upon future viewings.If you don't include Bronco Billy, this is Eastwood's third Western that he has both directed and starred in. 1973's High Plains Drifter was his first, and feels like his American interpretation of the spaghetti western genre that made him famous for his Man-With-No-Name roles, an element he borrows for Pale Rider as he is only referred to as 'Preacher' throughout the film. The second is 1976's The Outlaw Josey Wales, which might be viewed as his first revisionist Western, taking the time to show the harsh realities of a Civil War veteran\/guerrilla fugitive running for his life on the frontier. What Pale Rider gets right more than those two films is the scenery; the snowcapped mountain ranges and the scenic valleys make it arguably the most visually stunning film Eastwood has directed. Utilizing only three main locations, the sense of space is also perfect and gives the film an almost tangible feeling.I usually have a problem with the under lit quality of the cinematography in Eastwood's films as director, but here he actually puts it to good use. He takes full advantage of the beautiful locations, and saves the dark lighting for the interior scenes, whether it is a miner's cabin or the general store in town. This effect gives the film a more realistic or even revisionist quality, while the supernatural undertones of Eastwood's mysterious main character are a throwback to his main character in High Plains Drifter, though the results are far less stylized. These dueling aspects work in the movie's favor, like a fusion of his two earlier Westerns as a director.Much has been made about the plot similarities between Pale Rider and George Stevens' 1953 classic Western Shane. Yes, there are numerous scenes and characters that feel like an updated version of that classic, but the general storyline is similar to many films of this particular genre, immortalized by Shane but not specifically original to that film. On the contrary, Stevens' film is so highly stylized that it feels as if it were aiming for that classic status during its production. Eastwood's film, while borrowing heavily from that film's plot, is grittier and meaner, and has a different relationship to the landscape and nature so that it feels more like an Anthony Mann-Jimmy Stewart Western collaboration from the 1950s instead.The film's climactic showdown is what you'd expect from a Western, masterfully presented and suspenseful in the process. The supporting cast is also a great element to the film. Michael Moriarty is good as the simple miner trying to follow his dreams, and Carrie Snodgress perfect as his love interest, a woman embittered by time and circumstance, who receives a new spark of life when Eastwood's Preacher rides into the mining community. On the opposite side, Chris Penn does a fine job as the villainous son of the rival miner, spoiled and cowardly in his attempts to outdo the settlers he feels are in the way of his father's empire. And Richard Kiel, best known for playing Jaws in a couple of James Bond films, adds a quiet malevolent touch to the proceedings. From the casting to the setting, all of these elements come together nicely to form one of the greatest Westerns ever made.

The fish weighed in at 1,560 pounds, according to Wikipedia. Indeed, Wikipedia also notes that Hemingway caught a 700-pound marlin while on location for the filming of his novella! I was intrigued to read, as well, that the beautiful love story Undertow also was filmed at this remote corner of Peru.

This religious sect is strongly opposed to violence and war . The official name of the Quaker religion is Society of Friends , members of the faith are called Friends and nicknamed Quakers ; the book written by Jessamyn West is called The Friendly Persuasion, meaning the faith , which more specifically refers to the Quakers' way of communicating. It concerns about Jess Birdwell (Gary Cooper , he initially turned the film down because he didn't believe the American public would accept him as Quaker , and role was originally intended for Bing Crosby) is the patriarch of a family of Quakers , a Christian sect that refuses to take part in wars . His son Josh (Anthony Perkins) wishes to adhere to pacifism but worried he's using his religion to hide his cowardice , he then enlists the army , causing angry on his mother (Dorothy McGuire , though Katharine Hepburn turned down the role and Jean Arthur was considered to play her) . Their children are very special  the little boy Jess Jr. (Richard Eyer) lives in conflict with the goose Samantha . And Mattie (Phyllis Love) falls in love with an Union soldier, Gard Jordan (Peter Mark Richman) . As Jess\/Gary Cooper (before Cooper became involved Montgomery Clift was offered the role of Birdwell, but turned it down) along with his family attempt to remain to its ideals , despite the Civil War which touches their farm life .This enjoyable film packs comedy , religious and familiar life , sense of mood , spectacular battles and lots of reflection . As it deals with the conflict between maintaining a religious belief and reality when takes place a bloody war ; as the flick utterly catches up the spectator in the family's troubles . This earnest picture captures a tender humor and mirth which pervades the whole story ; in addition , at the end occurs a stirring climax . Agreeable screenplay , originally released without screen writing credit due to blacklisting of Michael Wilson; credits restored in 1996 . Spectacular battle depicted in the film based on facts, as the final is very exciting , it was against the Confederate raiders led by General John Hunt Morgan ; on July 9, 1863, 450 members of the Indiana Home Guard met John Hunt Morgan's raiders in battle south of the town of Corydon, Indiana . Gary Cooper as a devout Quaker father and Dorothy McGuire as his wife are very well as the parents ; furthermore , Anthony Perkins is nice as the son fearing being taken for a coward . Good support cast such as Robert Middleton , Peter Mark Richman , Richard Hale , Russell Simpson and uncredited , almost extras  Robert Fuller , William Schallert , John Dierkes , Joe Turkel and Doug McClure . Spectacular and glowingly gorgeous scenarios , including amusing race horses . Colorful and glimmer cinematography by Ellsworth Fredericks in De Luxe Colour Photography . Sensitive as well as moving musical score by the classical composer Dimitri Tiomkin . The motion picture come out of a minor Hollywood studio , Allied Artists , was compellingly directed by the maestro William Wyler . Wyler was considered by his peers as second only to John Ford as a master craftsman of cinema and the winner of three Best Director Academy Awards . Wyler was a great professional who had a career full of successes in all kind of genres as Film Noir  ¨Detective story¨ , ¨The desperate hours¨ , ¨Dead End¨ ; Western  ¨The Westener¨, ¨Friendly persuasion¨ , ¨Big Country¨ , but his speciality were dramas such as  ¨Jezebel¨ , ¨The letter¨ , ¨Wuthering Heights¨ , ¨The best years of our lives¨, ¨Mrs Miniver¨, ¨The heiress¨ , ¨the little Foxes¨ , ¨The collector¨ and Comedy as two films starred by Audrey Hepburn  ¨How to steal a million¨ and of course the immortal comedy-romance ¨Roman's holiday¨ . ¨Friendly persuasion¨ results to be a good film that catches up the audience .
