[{"date":"1 October 2008","score":"","review":" As a book is opened, and Shrek tells the story of a prince and a princess and utters the words Like that's ever going to happen does the film engage the audience and set the tome for a thoroughly enjoyable family adventure with good comedy, interesting protagonists and an entertaining narrative.When we first see Shrek's appearance we instantly gasp, but are instantly laughing and amazed as the credits role and observe an Ogre in his natural habitat, bathing in mud and eating gross things. This opening is very inviting and invites us into an unknown world and the life of a different character that is far from your average looking everyday hero. Shrek, a big and nasty looking man, is a symbol, an icon if you will, of defying odds and true hope. A sweet and tear jerking moment comes when he says They judge me before they even know me a real landmark for animation and appearances, and how they can be deceiving. Shrek, obviously different from other heroes, has this unique quality that makes him so likable. Despite his gross habits, we can identify with him on a personal level, being alone and at a distance from others, and this ideology of defying odds and appearances is one main reason to watch this film.Plenty of animations lie on physical comedy to entertain, but Shrek uses intertextuality to gain most laughs. Watch out for parodies of Disney classics, the matrix and others that will make you chuckle. Eddie Murphy's Donkey is by far the funniest character, being so hyper and enthusiastic that it's almost unbelievable.When we first see Princess Fiona, we are laughing by the sheer ideology of her and her long awaited rescue.Though after a while the plot becomes slightly predictable and over dramatic. However there are twists and turns in stock to keep away from the conventional narrative which is always a good thing.There are a few dry spells and the humour isn't always funny but nevertheless Shrek is one heart warming animation with a different hero whom we can all identify with.

Its structure is too predictable, exaggerated and mundane for an ever increasing and intelligent world that starves for realism, or at least parody. It shouldn't be a surprise, then, why films such as The Dark Knight or Enchanted are coming out and breaking those classical conventions in order to give audiences something new&#151;something fresh. We're moving away from the classical structure and progressing into the hybrid worlds of both morally ambiguous and farcical mellow dramas.Although The Mummy stayed fairly true to the mellow dramatic structure, there were certain parts that seemed to hint at more farcical interpretations. In other words, it seemed as though the filmmakers were comfortable in making fun of the film itself. For example, when eerie sounds of wind or moans would seep through an open window, Brendan Frasier's character would poke fun at how he expected things like that to happen That seems to happen a lot around here, he says mockingly. By doing so, he confirms a predictable convention in mellow drama that audiences have been spoon fed for far too long. The result people laugh and don't take the genre quite too seriously. Another progressive move away from the classical structure comes when Rachel Weisz' character foretells the demise of the unfaithful sidekick, Beni People like you always get their come uping's, she says, as if to confirm the tragic outcome of all villains in mellow dramas. These two scenes (and I'm sure there were others) depict socially progressive movements away from the cliché elements of mellow drama, and do so by playfully mocking the overall style of the film.Culturally regressive elements in the film deal with how both women and Arabs are portrayed. If memory serves me correct, I believe Rachel Weisz is one of the only female characters in the entire film. She is depicted as being clumsy and inferior; one not on equal playing ground as the men. Her clumsiness is demonstrated in the beginning when she knocks over an entire library of books, and her inferiority is shown when smug comments are thrown her way by certain gold diggers Don't worry; they have a woman on their side. They can't get too far. She also fits the classical mold of the damsel in distress; one that is helpless by herself and needs a hero to save her. All of these ideas reflect an age unknown to the generation we, today, live in. That is, today women hold much higher statuses and are even, in some cases, more capable than men than displayed in this film. Arabs are portrayed in two lights. In one sense, they are depicted as being traitors to their friends, as shown when Beni betrays Frasier; and in another sense, however, they are shown to be heroes; such as the relationship between Frasier and the Magi, who, at first, seems to be obstacle for Frasier, but later becomes his protecting warrior. The portrayal of Arabs, then, is split down the middle; reflecting them as both socially progressive heroes and culturally regressive traitors.

But it surely requires an eye to appreciate it's finesse. So its suggested that don't by any chance watch 'Taxi Driver' on 'any day any time' basis. Watch it when you feel you can attend to the movie completely without much distractions. Because a true work of art like this film cant be completely appreciated with lots of thought running on our mind. Robert De Niro ( the master actor ) plays the central character of a night shift cab driver - Travis Bickler in the Post Vietnam New York city. And this film attempts to show the viewer the mental turbulence's Travis faces while dealing with his lonesome existence in the city. The audience actually gets to feel the whole existential crisis from a purely Travis's POV. The viewer also understands why its all happening, the situations are very human. Why Travis pushes himself to isolation?, why does he drive at night when he gets to witnesses all of the city's scum ? Is it intentional, does he want it unconsciously, may be. While driving at night he witnesses all kind of filth around - pimps, prostitutes, crackheads all of it. A very interesting scene is when a bearded guy gets into his cab ( Martin Scorcese himself ) and tells him about his wife cheating on him and 'What a .44 magnum will do to her pussy... that you should see'. All this while Travis seems to merely observe. Travis develops a liking for a woman - Bettsy a party worker for the Palantine, The Presidential Nominee. He approaches Bettsy while she is at work and asks her out for a date for which she agrees. When they meet up the other day Travis takes her to a Porno Theatre, Bettsy walks out of the movie real annoyed. While Travis tries his best to makeup, Bettsy seems too hard headed to give away. All this and other incidences kindle Travis's neurosis. He feels the need to take charge of things. He buys pistols and trains himself with them. In one of the scenes we see him acting out with a mirror ' You talking to me ? '. As he his getting ready for the battle we see him drawn towards a young girl - Iris ( Jodie Foster - Silence of the Lamb fame ) and seems intrigued by her. He approaches her pimp - Micheal ( Harvey Keitel - Reservior Dogs fame ) and asks if he could make out with her. Whats interesting here is Travis's disgust of Micheal and the long stare he gives him. Travis then gets to talk to Iris in private where he tells her how young she was and what young people are supposed to do. Iris a bit startled asks Travis if they can meet for breakfast the next day. They meet up and Travis points out what a lowlife she was leading and that she should return home. Iris sees his point and conveys this to Micheal only to be swayed back to prostitution. The climax and other events towards the end mark a good ending ( note- not in the sense of the word - good, but in the sense of the reviewer). Overall a masterpiece , an interesting note though from IMDb Trivia - 'The story was partially autobiographical for Paul Schrader , who suffered a nervous breakdown while living in Los Angeles. He was fired from the AFI, basically friendless, in the midst of a divorce and was rejected by a girlfriend. Squatting in his ex-girlfriend's apartment while she was away for a couple of months, Schrader literally didn't talk to anyone for many weeks, went to porno theaters and developed an obsession with guns.'

This split decision revolves around two things; firstly the gross content. Any film that makes you feel uneasy or quite sick at what's going on on screen could automatically plant a negative opinion within your mind but this idea battles with the effectiveness of the film in the sense; if a film is so nasty in its content and unravelling of events that it evokes a definite reaction from the viewer, it could be deemed a success because the filmmakers have succeeded in what they set out to do.Trainspotting is one of those films. Like I mentioned, horror films usually have this effect. An example could be Wolf Creek or Hostel; two films that gave me a distinct feeling of unpleasantness but some other recent horror films, such as The Descent or Miike's One Missed Call can leave me without any feeling at all as they meander along to their inevitable conclusions; throwing in plenty of blood-soaked action or dull jumps along the way. Are Wolf Creek and Hostel 'better' than these two because I had more of a reaction to them? Or are The Descent and One Missed Call 'better' because they didn't gross me out.Trainspotting isn't a horror film, but it borders on being a horrible film and I mean that in the nicest possible way. The film is so vile and disgusting in its visuals and establishing of certain situations (one in a public toilet springs to mind) that you just can't help but admire what they've done effect-wise but feel a little uneasy all the same. It's this emotional juxtaposition that director Danny Boyle pulls off here and I think it's this that makes Trainspotting the film it is, especially given the fact it is not particularly plot driven. Obviously you hear and take in a lot of what's already been said about a film as well known as Trainspotting and a film as 'accepted' as Trainspotting but it's more than a mere flavour of the month for a certain generation.At the time when this was made, the British crime genre (and later the gangster genre) could be seen as genres in a state of transition. Two years previously, with Paul W. S. Anderson's 'Shopping', there was a film that revolved around Britain's youth as they get up to youth orientated activities to do with crime. Then came Boyle's own Shallow Grave before this, a story about lowlifes doing low brow things always connected to crime. But it isn't the demonising of ram raiding and joyriding as seen in Shopping that is being studied here, more so the frequent use of the class A drug heroin. The film revolves around Renton (McGregor) and his cronies, all of whom are introduced somewhat perfectly at the very beginning echoing a tactic the godfather of British crime films Brighton Rock used at the very beginning of that film and something Guy Ritchie's 'Snatch.' would later re-use.Trainspotting is told from a second person point of view, that is the narrator is involved in the events he is telling us of. It's easy to miss but Renton actually comes off heroin on two occasions, from memory, in this film with the final time adding to the film's overall final twist. As an anti-hero, Renton fits the bill quite well. Whilst utterly despicable in his casualness at talking about and taking heroin, scenes that will no doubt have you winching if needles are not your bag, he sort of redeems himself when he talks about wanting to come off it and is put across as a social person who does seem to have certain hobbies and interests outside of being a junkie; namely talking about actors, films and Academy Awards.As with all youth orientated films, youth orientated activity plays a big role. Since the principal study here is the damning of heroin, secondary studies like casual sex and the over consumption of alcohol can be wrapped up in double quick time and take nothing away from the film. In fact the film can deliver these moral messages in more ways than one and actually turn them into entertaining scenes without ever feeling like a lecture or lesson. The scene where Renton tries to pick up a young girl at a club only to find out she was underage is one demonisation; Begbie's (Carlyle) incident with a cross dresser in an ever changing world he is in ignorance of is another incident and on another occasion a character and his partner wish to watch a previously recorded sex session as they commit the act once again; only the guy accidentally lent the tape to someone else thinking it was another video. Panic ensures when they assume it to be back at the video rental store.So while Trainspotting is a thrill ride that conflicts pleasantries with your filmic mind and that lust for a good, effective film; it holds up. There is a switch between realism (in general) and surrealism when he ventures down a toilet to find drugs and comes home wet to the eerie 'rehab-at-home' scene in which an apparent ghost of a previously dead baby climbs the walls and terrorises our hero as his friends and family slip in and out of the bed with him. Trainspotting is fast, furious and unrelenting in its content that can be funny; suspenseful; quite scary and downright disgusting &#150; it's one of those film viewing experiences you don't forget in a hurry.

Trainspotting is fast, furious and unrelenting in its content that can be funny; suspenseful; quite scary and downright disgusting &#150; it's one of those film viewing experiences you don't forget in a hurry. ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"1 October 2008","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" A film like Trainspotting can split your opinion right down the middle; a split more akin to the sort of opinion you might take away from a horror film. This split decision revolves around two things; firstly the gross content. Any film that makes you feel uneasy or quite sick at what's going on on screen could automatically plant a negative opinion within your mind but this idea battles with the effectiveness of the film in the sense; if a film is so nasty in its content and unravelling of events that it evokes a definite reaction from the viewer, it could be deemed a success because the filmmakers have succeeded in what they set out to do.Trainspotting is one of those films. Like I mentioned, horror films usually have this effect. An example could be Wolf Creek or Hostel; two films that gave me a distinct feeling of unpleasantness but some other recent horror films, such as The Descent or Miike's One Missed Call can leave me without any feeling at all as they meander along to their inevitable conclusions; throwing in plenty of blood-soaked action or dull jumps along the way. Are Wolf Creek and Hostel 'better' than these two because I had more of a reaction to them? Or are The Descent and One Missed Call 'better' because they didn't gross me out.Trainspotting isn't a horror film, but it borders on being a horrible film and I mean that in the nicest possible way. The film is so vile and disgusting in its visuals and establishing of certain situations (one in a public toilet springs to mind) that you just can't help but admire what they've done effect-wise but feel a little uneasy all the same. It's this emotional juxtaposition that director Danny Boyle pulls off here and I think it's this that makes Trainspotting the film it is, especially given the fact it is not particularly plot driven. Obviously you hear and take in a lot of what's already been said about a film as well known as Trainspotting and a film as 'accepted' as Trainspotting but it's more than a mere flavour of the month for a certain generation.At the time when this was made, the British crime genre (and later the gangster genre) could be seen as genres in a state of transition. Two years previously, with Paul W. S. Anderson's 'Shopping', there was a film that revolved around Britain's youth as they get up to youth orientated activities to do with crime. Then came Boyle's own Shallow Grave before this, a story about lowlifes doing low brow things always connected to crime. But it isn't the demonising of ram raiding and joyriding as seen in Shopping that is being studied here, more so the frequent use of the class A drug heroin. The film revolves around Renton (McGregor) and his cronies, all of whom are introduced somewhat perfectly at the very beginning echoing a tactic the godfather of British crime films Brighton Rock used at the very beginning of that film and something Guy Ritchie's 'Snatch.' would later re-use.Trainspotting is told from a second person point of view, that is the narrator is involved in the events he is telling us of. It's easy to miss but Renton actually comes off heroin on two occasions, from memory, in this film with the final time adding to the film's overall final twist. As an anti-hero, Renton fits the bill quite well. Whilst utterly despicable in his casualness at talking about and taking heroin, scenes that will no doubt have you winching if needles are not your bag, he sort of redeems himself when he talks about wanting to come off it and is put across as a social person who does seem to have certain hobbies and interests outside of being a junkie; namely talking about actors, films and Academy Awards.As with all youth orientated films, youth orientated activity plays a big role. Since the principal study here is the damning of heroin, secondary studies like casual sex and the over consumption of alcohol can be wrapped up in double quick time and take nothing away from the film. In fact the film can deliver these moral messages in more ways than one and actually turn them into entertaining scenes without ever feeling like a lecture or lesson. The scene where Renton tries to pick up a young girl at a club only to find out she was underage is one demonisation; Begbie's (Carlyle) incident with a cross dresser in an ever changing world he is in ignorance of is another incident and on another occasion a character and his partner wish to watch a previously recorded sex session as they commit the act once again; only the guy accidentally lent the tape to someone else thinking it was another video.

With its impossible shadows and bleak plot elements, it embodies everything that makes the genre what it is. The protagonist of the film is Holly Martins, an American who goes to Vienna because his friend Harry Lime has offered him a job there. Upon reaching Vienna, Martins discovers that his friend has been run over by a car and killed. Or has he? Holly Martins is played by Joseph Cotten, a renowned actor of the period. Since Martins is the protagonist it is his journey throughout the film that is the most fleshed out, and it is he with whom we sympathise. Joseph Cotten does a good job of making his character seem believable and sympathetic, and portrays his journey from an innocent child-like author of westerns to a hardened man who has seen too much of the world with great skill.The leading lady is Alida Valli, who plays Anna Schmidt. Schmidt was Harry Lime's girlfriend before the 'accident', and the character is deeply upset by her loss. Alida Valli manages to portray her character with a haunting believability. There is something mysterious and sad about the character which is not seen in very many other films.But what really makes the film good is the performance of Orson Welles. Welles plays Harry Lime himself, and though the character really gets a minimal amount of screen time, Welles really steals the show. He doesn't just chew on the scenery, he swallows it whole! His character is the most complex of all, so pulling it off as well as Welles did is no walk in the park. Welles manages to show Lime's evil mixed with friendship for his wholesome friend Holly. His entrance to the film, as the light from an upstairs window beams down across his childish face, is by far the most memorable shot in the entire film. The look that he gives his old friend, half guilty half happy, still stays fixed in my eyes now.There is a reason that this film won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. It is superb. As I have said before, the film has many impossible shadows, as well as tilted camera shots. I think we have all seen scenes in films where a huge shadow coming round a corner precedes its considerably smaller caster. This was the film that invented that device. Even with the impossible shadows and camera angles, the cinematography does not feel out of place. With the films tone of darkness, evil and falsity, the shadows fit right in, and the askew camera angles only enhance the askew plot points.The music of the film was written by Anton Karas. It is almost entirely zither music, and it brings a unique feel to the film. While the light-hearted music seems out of place at first, the viewer eventually gets used to it, and the music actually takes the film along a whole other road to where it would have gone wit darker music. While mostly light, the music is undoubtedly intense, and it emphasises certain themes very well, particularly in the scene just before the landlord gets murdered. As he turns around and notices his off-screen attacker, the music comes on very strong, and gives a feeling of fear to the film. As much as the music works in certain scenes, the lack of music works in others. During the showdown in the sewer, there is almost no music; just the sound of the falling water echoing through the tunnels. This gives a true sense of realism to the scene.The director, Sir Carol Reed did very well with this film. He (as opposed to she, no matter what the name suggests) managed to evoke the characters feelings from not only the actors, but from the lighting and scenery as well. There is something about The Third Man that is unique. While it feels dated, many of the themes the movie embodies are still relevant today, and it is still enjoyable to modern audiences.

It features a strong and greatly compelling story, strong characters, fine acting, great production values and whatever more. A true masterpiece in my book!It's mostly a story and character driven movie. This might sound boring to some but let me tell you that Karakter is anything from boring, unlike most other Dutch productions within the same genre. It's a real exciting psychological thriller, without really featuring any action or much dialog in it. Mike van Diem does an amazing job telling the movie its story. He just doesn't only did a great job with its story but also with the movie its look and atmosphere and he got the best out of the actors.The movie is also really made by it's acting. The acting was surprisingly great within the entire movie, which already is a big accomplishment for any Dutch production. Fedja van Huêt, despite his young age, carries the movie really well and he has probably already played the role out of his career in this movie, even though his career obviously isn't over yet. Same goes for Jan Decleir. He plays one of the most complicated and memorable villain role out of movie history, I kid you not. Even though he is not the type of movie villain who kills or uses violence, he is more ruthless in the way his personality is and how he subtly moves around and is important throughout the movie, by giving his son a hard accomplishing anything in life. An even bigger accomplishment from Decleir when considering how few lines he actually has throughout the movie. Yeah it might sound weird but he reminded me a lot of Darth Vader from the Star Wars movies. He's just as cold and ruthless, doesn't show any emotions, walks around with a long cape and in the end his character seeks redemption with his son.The movie is set in the the 1920's Rotterdam. The movie has a nice impressive historical look over it and does an amazing job reconstructing Rotterdam of the 1920's, even though the movie didn't got filmed in Rotterdam itself, which isn't anything too surprising considering Rotterdam got bombed heavily during WW II and almost all of the old city heart is completely gone now days and the city is filled with modern buildings and skyscrapers now days. Normally it's very small scaled and perhaps even a bit embarrassing to look at a Dutch movie that tries to recreate a different much older time period. Mostly they'll trow one old car in a sequences, with 10 people walking around in old clothes and that's it. But Karakter is however very detailed with its look and overall atmosphere.Besides the movie its look and overall cinematography and directing I also really liked the movie its editing, which kept the movie going at all times. It uses some nice cutting tricks to achieve this and it really helps to make this movie an exciting one to watch.It's a movie that sucks you right in its story and doesn't ever let you go. You'll forget everything around you and won't be able to get your eyes of the screen, or even blink for that matter. The movie doesn't feature a story I would normally like within a movie, especially not from a Dutch movie but Karakter just does basically everything right to grab you and suck you right into it.

The movie has a nice impressive historical look over it and does an amazing job reconstructing Rotterdam of the 1920's, even though the movie didn't got filmed in Rotterdam itself, which isn't anything too surprising considering Rotterdam got bombed heavily during WW II and almost all of the old city heart is completely gone now days and the city is filled with modern buildings and skyscrapers now days. Normally it's very small scaled and perhaps even a bit embarrassing to look at a Dutch movie that tries to recreate a different much older time period. Mostly they'll trow one old car in a sequences, with 10 people walking around in old clothes and that's it. But Karakter is however very detailed with its look and overall atmosphere.Besides the movie its look and overall cinematography and directing I also really liked the movie its editing, which kept the movie going at all times. It uses some nice cutting tricks to achieve this and it really helps to make this movie an exciting one to watch.It's a movie that sucks you right in its story and doesn't ever let you go. You'll forget everything around you and won't be able to get your eyes of the screen, or even blink for that matter. The movie doesn't feature a story I would normally like within a movie, especially not from a Dutch movie but Karakter just does basically everything right to grab you and suck you right into it. An haunting, beautiful, impressive movie, that you'll won't easily forget.10\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"1 October 2008","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" My first reaction to this film was that it was too obviously a product of the 1960's. From the music, to the clothing, to the hairstyles, to the dances it reeks of the 60's too much to be truly relevant to 2008. Having said that, upon reflection I also realize that some of it might have even seemed a bit old-fashioned in the 60's. In an era when women's libbers were starting to burn bras, I think of Sir's request of one of his female colleagues to teach some of his female students how to use makeup, because some of them would look very pretty if they knew how. (Not to mention his female colleague's ready agreement to his suggestion, unusual for a very young female teacher who would presumably be up on the social trends of the day.) Frankly, the basic story has also been done more powerfully. I think of Morgan Freeman's turn in Lean on Me for example. The movie was also, I thought, a bit naive. This class of rowdies seemed to come around far too easily.Sidney Poitier's performance as the new teacher sent in to deal with this class of inner-city rebels was a complicated one. At first he didn't really grab me, but once I thought about it I began to appreciate his work more. He plays a very detached Thackeray (known as Sir), and seemed uncomfortably distant at times. At first I thought it was a flaw in his performance, but then I realized this was probably a very accurate take on Thackeray. I mean, the guy really didn't want to be there. He wanted to work as an engineer, and wasn't shy about making it known that teaching was at best a second choice that he couldn't wait to get out of. You ended up questioning does he really care about these kids, or is it just his job to look like he's caring about these kids? Was he just a more convincing Weston (one of his definitely uncaring colleagues) in other words. Being detached was probably the way Thackeray would have been. Poitier was definitely the star of the movie. The other actors playing the teachers were mostly window-dressing, although Geoffrey Bayldon's take on Weston as the burned out teacher who just couldn't care less about these kids anymore was quite convincing. The students were a bit more interesting - especially Judy Geeson as Pamela, who falls for Thackeray, and Christian Roberts as Denham, the hardest case of the bunch. There were also some good scenes the opening scene on the bus was quite funny; Thackeray catching the girls burning something (the movie doesn't identify what it is but apparently the novel tells us that it's a used sanitary napkin); his boxing match with Denham; saving the gym teacher from Denham; and the emotion when he's presented with a good-bye gift from the students at the end of the year. All those stood out for me and remain with me, as did the title song, which is wonderful, and was performed by Lulu, who played one of the students.Having said that, the movie's predictable. You know that the kids are going to turn around (which, as I said, they do far too easily) and you know that in the end Thackeray is going to decide to stay (although the suspense about that was kept going right to the end.) I opened with a comparison to Lean On Me. To me, what made that movie more powerful was its reality based story, whereas this is based on a novel and therefore can't be taken too seriously. It's got a lot of good stuff in it, but I still thought it no better than average. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 October 2008","score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" My first reaction to this film was that it was too obviously a product of the 1960's.

Long after his escape in Memphis, Hannibal Lecter finds himself living in Florence, Italy, where he is the running to become the curator for a major library. In America, Clarice Starling has just endured a major blow to her career in the FBI as a drug bust goes terribly wrong. As a result, she is returned to the Hannibal Lecter case at the prompting of millionaire (and one of Lecter's only surviving victims) Mason Verger, who has his own plans for the doctor.The novel was somewhere around 600-pages and had a strong, in-depth storyline...much more than they could ever hope to fit into the average feature film. So a good portion of the book was trimmed for the film, though they left most of the major aspects in place (though some parts were modified from the original story). Even still, by fitting so much into the film, I definitely felt the running time during some scenes. I felt that when the focus shifted to Florence and Italian detective Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini), the film slowed to a crawl for the following 45 minutes. The film's overall pacing seems to speed up and slow down randomly throughout the course of the film. Visually, though, the film is beautiful and done well.This film is missing two major aspects of the first director Jonathan Demme and Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling. In my opinion, yeah Demme's great, but Ridley Scott is better and it was awesome having him direct this film. As for Foster, I would have preferred to have her reprise her role but Julianne Moore did a good job of filling in the role. Anthony Hopkins returns as the titular character and continues to show why Lecter is one of my favorite film characters. The man is evil, charismatic, and (despite his history of eating people) so damned likable. Aside from Hopkins, the real highlight of this movie for me was Gary Oldman as the disfigured Mason Verger. I don't know what it is about that guy but I love his performances in eccentric roles.I loved the blend of grisly violence and elegant sophistication in this film. In one scene, you're seeing Lecter's charming side as he wins the position of library curator; later, you're watching as one of Lecter's enemies is hung\/disemboweled. You've got to love it.

It stars Wil Wheaton and River Phoenix as best friends in a small 1950's Oregon town. Within this 88 minute masterpiece, you'll experience thrills, chills, laughs, and an unnerving need to throw up. It all starts when a dead body is found on the outskirts of Castle Rock, Oregon. When Chris (Phoenix), Gordon (Wheaton), Teddy (Corey Feldman), and Vern (Jerry O'Connell) hear about this, they decide to go on an epic adventure to find it. All is fun and games until Vern's older brother and his gang of scoundrels go searching for the body as well. With dilemmas like a ruthless game of chicken and a river full of leeches, the two gangs go to all lengths until they meet up and all hell breaks loose. With deep conversations and hilariously immature outbursts, this movie never loses tension and will keep you satisfied to the very end.The movie takes place in Castle Rock, Oregon, and its surrounding counties, in the year 1959. Most of the film is shown on the train tracks in the county, which brought a lot of lighting and setting options to the movie. That, plus the music, camera work, and costumes, give the movie a great 1950's feeling. The mood of the different scenes is normally set by the sound, or lack of it.

Instead, it's a drama about human nature and its darker instincts. A good film, yes, but I really can't see this as a comedy.Jack Lemmon plays a guy who is determined to get ahead at the huge insurance company where he works. His plan is to ingratiate himself to the supervisors so they'll notice him and owe him a promotion. The problem is that to do this, he lowers himself to the level of a pimp, of sorts. You see, the bosses all want to have a secret place to take their mistresses. Often this means that Lemmon is stuck outside waiting for these men to finish up their sexual escapades instead of sleeping or otherwise enjoying his own little apartment. However, with his eyes on the prize, no matter how thoughtless these cads are, Lemmon is always obliging.Eventually, however, the big boss (Fred MacMurray) finds out and Lemmon is happy--maybe the shenanigans can stop and he can finally have his apartment back each night. However, MacMurray, too, wants in on the love shack and his fling involves a nice lady that Lemmon has admired for some time. However, being basically a coward and power-hungry, Lemmon says nothing and goes along with MacMurray's sleazy plan.Eventually, Lemmon gets the advancements he wanted but also has a hard time living with what he's become. His neighbor's words--do you want to be a mensch (Yiddish for 'man' or 'person') come to haunt him. Will he continue to do just about anything for a raise? Or, will he stand up, for once, and be a man? The movie has a lot going for it. In particular, Jack Lemmon's performance is exceptional as are the other performances. In a role that is rather against type, MacMurray plays a low down dog--a character even more unlikable than the one he played in DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Otherwise, excellent direction, a gritty and amazing script and some haunting music all contribute to make this an exceptional picture--though I do think it's a tiny bit overrated (given that it received so much notice at the Oscars). Still, you can't do wrong with this surprisingly adult drama from 1960--though younger kids won't enjoy it and the sexual innuendo is a reason not to let them watch it as well.

At first the doc laughs it off as some sort of mass delusion but evidence soon begins to mount that there may be more to the stories than he first thought & after seeing strange large seed pod type 'things' turning into people he know before his very eyes the doc is convinced that these alien seed pods intend to take over the entire Earth as they seek to clone very living person turning them into emotionless shells...Originally having the working title They Came from Another World this Don Siegel directed classic slice of modest low budget black and white 50's Sci-Fi alien invasion flick is a terrific film & is far removed from most stereotypical cheap 50's potboilers with a real tense atmosphere & a pretty creepy & intelligent story. Clocking in at under 80 minutes with the studio tacked on start & ending with the original version running a mere 75 minutes this moves along like a rocket, the story is tight, taught, makes sense, people & character's behave in a fairly believable way & the central plot is both gripping, intriguing & certainly draws you in. The plot relies on generating paranoia just like another classic 50's Sci-Fi film The Thing from Another World (1951) & it's no coincidence that the two are two of the finest genre films of the 50's. There's good tension & it is sustained & increased as the alien plot unfolds, the basic concept of who one can trust is a very primeval instinct & that's maybe why these films are so effective. It's not perfect though, it's never explained what happens to a persons body after they are cloned & the alien version comes to life & the climax at the cave doesn't quite work either with Becky going to sleep but then seemingly reawaken taken over. Why was she not cloned? Why was her mind taken over & not anybody else's? If she was cloned how did the alien version get inside the cave? Watch it, think about it & the story & it just doesn't quite work which is a shame since otherwise it's a terrific film that still manages to be very effective even today in the ultra cynical world of 2008.While most 50's Sci-Fi at the time featured actor's in badly fitting rubber alien suits & car hubcaps hung on string to portray a flying saucer Invasion of the Body Snatchers relies on atmosphere & tension, in fact apart from the large alien seed pods there's no special effects at all. Proved iconic enough to spawn three direct remakes starting with Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) which is my own personal favourite version & moves the action to San Francisco, Body Snatchers (1993) which shifts the action to a US military base & the more recent The Invasion (2007) with Nicole Kidman & Daniel Craig while the highly entertaining teen horror flick The Faculty (1998) has basically the same plot.According to the IMDb this had a budget of about $417,000 which really is no money even back then, crisply shot in black and white (although a computer colourised version has been released) the film has a modest but nice look to it. The acting is pretty good but this is one of those films where the story really carries it.Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a classic piece of 50's Sci-Fi that stands head & shoulders above it's peers from the time, a great film that still remains very effective even when viewed today.

It is true that General Santa Ana was indeed an idiot and one of the most inept leaders you could imagine (read up about the Pastry War and his leg's subsequent lavish funeral and you'll know what I mean). Nevertheless, one of the problems that Texans had with Mexican rule was that it would not allow slavery--not just that the General was a dumb dictator. This important fact was never mentioned and there was a rather insulting character of a slave who was given his freedom just before the Mexicans slaughtered everyone. In the film, he chose to stay and die and even went so far as to throw his body across his master's to try to prevent the master's death. While I suppose this could have happened, it is very doubtful. I think this was distorted because John Wayne (who bankrolled and directed the film) wanted to make a super-patriotic film and talking about the slavery debate would have definitely weakened his narrative--though I am sure the Black Americans who saw the film were offended. The Texans were patriots, but flawed as well.An interesting contrast is how the Mexicans were portrayed in the film. Santa Ana's troops were portrayed as brave and loyal and Hispanics were humanized in the movie. In addition, John Wayne took quite a fancy to a lovely Mexican lady in the first half of the film. This sympathetic view is not surprising, though, as Wayne's real life wives were Mexican. Despite the hyperbole and sentimentality that abounds in the film, you really do have to applaud the film for several reasons. The battle sequences are rather amazing and well-done. Also, some of the many little vignettes were rather moving and interesting. However, all these little touches did make the movie very, very long--probably about 10-20 minutes too long. Had it been tightened up a bit, it might have flowed better and prevented butt fatigue in the audience! The film just wasn't compelling enough during the first 3\/4 of the film--though the movie did end on a very high note with the final battle. I actually love long films--but this one just didn't need to be.I think overall that the film is a mixed bag--not nearly as bad as its reputation would suggest, is very exciting and has some excellent performances, though its rather one-dimensional view of the conflict and its extreme length have to be considered before you watch it.

Despite the hyperbole and sentimentality that abounds in the film, you really do have to applaud the film for several reasons. The battle sequences are rather amazing and well-done. Also, some of the many little vignettes were rather moving and interesting. However, all these little touches did make the movie very, very long--probably about 10-20 minutes too long. Had it been tightened up a bit, it might have flowed better and prevented butt fatigue in the audience! The film just wasn't compelling enough during the first 3\/4 of the film--though the movie did end on a very high note with the final battle. I actually love long films--but this one just didn't need to be.I think overall that the film is a mixed bag--not nearly as bad as its reputation would suggest, is very exciting and has some excellent performances, though its rather one-dimensional view of the conflict and its extreme length have to be considered before you watch it.

The main character is tongue kissing what appears to be a thirteen year old girl over and over. The noise that it was making was particularly disgusting. Telly is only seventeen years old, but he is already a real dirt bag. He steals money from his parents and tries to deflower as many girls as he can, typically preying on girls that have just finished going through puberty. It is here that the main conflict of the movie is introduced. One of Telly's former conquests contracts HIV from him and tires to stop him from spreading his disease to his unsuspecting victims. Over the course of the movie at least three people are given the HIV virus from Telly the first virgin that he deflowers at the beginning of the film, the second girl at the end of the film and the guy that they beat up in the park. But what I found troubling was that the girl who knew she got AIDS from him decided to just take some ecstasy and forget all about the fact that she was trying to stop him. She herself even becomes an instrument to spread AIDS by the end of the movie due to her irresponsible behavior. This is where the movie kind of just became an ambiguous story about how teenagers behave and forgot all about its own plot.Overall this movie mostly just felt like a public service announcement about the dangers of unsafe sex. I'm sure that back in the 90's when AIDS was an automatic death warrant this movie was very shocking and even more terrifying, but in the twenty first century where AIDS has lost most of its potency due to modern medicine this film is little more than a friendly reminder that condoms can save you from a lot of problems. Kids is still a good movie and it's worth watching just don't expect to get any life changing message from it.

In the Gingerbread Man he actually has to work with something that, unfortunately, he isn't always very successful at, or at least it's not the first thing on his checklist as director plot. There's one of those big, juicy almost pot-boiler plots where a sleazy lawyer gets caught up with a desperate low-class woman and then a nefarious figure whom the woman is related with enters their lives in the most staggering ways, twists and plot ensues, yada yada. And it's surprising that Altman would really want to take on one of these I saw that coming from back there! endings, or just a such a semi-conventional thriller.But it's a surprise that pays off because, oddly enough, Altman is able to catch some of that very fine behavior, or rather is able to unintentionally coax it out of a very well-cast ensemble, of a small-town Georgian environment. The film drips with atmosphere (if not total superlative craftsmanship, sometimes it's good and sometimes just decent for Altman), as Savannah is possibly going to be hit by a big hurricane and the swamp and marshes and rain keep things soaked and muggy and humid. So the atmosphere is really potent, but so are performances from (sometimes) hysterical Kenneth Branaugh, Embeth Davitz as the 'woman' who lawyer Branaugh gets caught up with, and Robert Downey Jr (when is he *not* good?) as the private detective in Branaugh's employ. Did I neglect Robert Duvall, who in just five minutes of screen time makes such an indelible impression to hang the bad-vibes of the picture on? As said, some of the plot is a little weak, or just kind of standard (lawyer is divorced, bitter custody battle looms, innocent and goofy kids), but at the same time I think Altman saw something captivating in the material, something darker than some of the other Grisham works that has this standing out somehow. If it's not entirely masterful, it still works on its limited terms as a what-will-happen-next mystery-Southern-noir.
