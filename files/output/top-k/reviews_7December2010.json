The major mistake of this film was coming after the 3 older Herbie's films, which sealed its doom from the very start. Had it been made before them and maybe things would have been different, it probably would have been more successful and appreciated. But then we wouldn't have Joaquin Garay III in it. Back when the 1st Herbie film 'The Love Bug' came out (1968), Joaquin Garay III was just coming to our world. Without taking off merit to other kids, I don't know if this movie would have been so good without Joaquin Garay III. He cheers me up so much in this movie.This film is so unique and feels so different from the previous ones that it's more than just another sequel. I think of it almost as one that doesn't belong to the same family of movies.This movie is a jewel. I dare to say it's worth gold. They don't make them like this anymore. Now there are a few minor flaws but otherwise there is lots to like it's delightful, charming, timeless, entertaining, nostalgic and the way the story is told is funny. There are lots of moments of great fun, but really funny humor (classic humor) and absolutely no dirty humor.Concerning the soundtrack, the only song I find nothing special is Look at me. Aside that, I adore the cheer song I found a new friend and the cheer music with no singing played at the opening credits and other parts.The locations are a major appeal beautiful, desirable and exotic destinations like Mexico and Panama, perfect for some unforgettable Summer vacations and even better if it's in a voyage by cruise ship.Harvey Korman portrays the pirate maniac Captain Blythe - crazy but funny at the same time. The actors who play the bad guys are pretty good either. Stephen W. Burns makes a very convincing Pete Stancheck.Joaquin Garay III is excellent in his overactive performance as cute little Paco and his chemistry with Herbie is perfect. There's something special about this unusual friendship between this lovable but mischievous little boy and the world's most charismatic Volkswagen Beetle. The way how Paco and Herbie communicate with each other is funny and reminds me of Pete's Dragon because we can't understand the dragon's language but the boy does and continues talking to him normally as if it's no big deal to understand. The same happens to Herbie and Paco.Herbie is called Ocho by Paco because he doesn't know the car's real name and misunderstands the meaning of the number 53. Apparently he interprets them as separate numbers, possibly because of that line in the middle of the car's hood, which results in one number at each side. What he does is plain and simple he adds both numbers et voilà!A very appropriate movie for children, with everything they can wish in a movie and no inappropriate stuff for them. It's a shame that children of this generation do not appreciate this kind of movies so beloved by children of my generation. Despite being very childish, it's also very appropriate for adults, as long they appreciate good old classics and have no qualms with this one in particular.Title in Portugal 'As Novas Diabruras de Herbie'.

Boom! for real action. This one starts with candy for the kids, a panning scanner; then it brings in a rip-off from Alien old reliable chest-buster (but we know already that nothing can happen to Ripley, 'cause then the movie is a goner, bummer). Then we are invited to a nonsensical inquiry through which everyone involved seems to go sleepwalking. At some point I even saw a guy dozing off, there. A bit later a girl screams her lungs off, when seeing her face-hugged dad. That's subtle. Then, for at least half an hour the action moves on in an anecdotal way, in events all loosely connected, in which no personal interactions are developed, suggested; no undercurrents, no solid dramatic base on which to build an emotional plot, create tensions, even if a general direction has already been given by Alien. It becomes worse when they arrive to LV 426 and the action dissolves then in bits of swearing and banter by unlikable, one-dimensional, characters and in the&#x97;I guess--organizing of things. (one thing that intrigues me most is how reviewers speak here of well developed characters when all I see is a basic, generic, stereotype of youth posturing, cussing and making abundant use of words like awesome, cool, f***k you. If it wasn't for their physical presences I couldn't even differentiate amongst them). At this point nothing holds things together and the plot is hanging by a single thread they are there to kick butt. By now Ripley has been ostracized and she looks distracted, as if asking herself what she is doing there. So it's high time to bring in the things that will keep the movie moving; they are the fight with the aliens, the Ripley-Newt relationship and the mystery of the alien eggs. There seems to be nothing wrong with this program, but there's actually one big problem.At this point we don't give a hoot about what may happen to the mob of foul-mouthed, undisciplined punks. We know anyway that nothing lethal will happen to Ripley--'cause then the movie...etc. As for the LV 426 colonizers, they are abstract, non-existent. So we could sit back and relax, watch the movie as if it was a video game--which in fact, I see, many people did. But no film maker wants that, so JC had to insert here something to keep us emotionally involved. Now, these clowns are not different from those who tried to set Willard's boat on fire or jump into the Playboy chopper. Difference is, Coppola is a master filmmaker. He just loads the jerks in a chopper and sends them off to battle at the strains of the Valkyries and there you got a classic. (Or Spielberg for that matter who, when not being sloppy, can create a classic out of a fish jumping out of the water and eating people). But Cameron doesn't seem to be able of giving that stroke of genius to this work, so he resorts here, as he did in Titanic, to simpler, reliable things; things that ordinary movie makers, or those who don't want to take risks, use when trying to stir our emotions, as for ex. the tearjerker, the loving relationship. In Titanic the couple is Rose\/Jack, here's Ripley\/Newt. Difference is, while DiCaprio\/Winslet were quite good, this relation looks fake, contrived. That kid seems under threat of great punishment if not acting exaggeratedly cute and touching. So much so I couldn't stand those tender moments between them two. (As a Gilmore Girls fan I have a good idea about how these scenes are done with taste). Or, to mention a far better known case, remember Dorothy and the Witch of the North. The contrived quality of this relationship reaches the sublime of the ridiculous during the final showdown, when Ripley hollers that immortal line in film History Get away from her, bitch!. I almost cried. Some say her--until then unknown--daughter explains it all, but the opposite is true the deceased girl's story was just tacked on here to justify Newt's inclusion in the plot (Ripley never mentioned a kid in Alien). That shows also the weakness of the plot, or the director's fear that a relationship based solely in the personal interaction of the two wouldn't be strong, credible, enough. Why couldn't have reacted Ripley in the same way, motherly protective, if she had never had a daughter? If, in Titanic, JC showered us with clichés, here we are with rehashed bits mostly from Alien A bad robot morphs into a good one and the villain will be a human; Ripley goes back for a cat first, now for a girl, all that during final countdowns, etc. I think Cameron's main problem in Aliens, as with Titanic, is not one of lack of talent but that he made two films about topics he's unfamiliar with.

There's the main reason for all the stereotyping and cliché lading, I guess.Totally forgettable flick.

I think that those two films show the same for Cameron who, as the product of a neutral, pacifist, Canadian culture, doesn't know what and how Vietnam really was--Aliens is Vietnam in Space after all--or what to lose a whole empire means&#x97;-of which the Titanic was the ultimate symbol. There's the main reason for all the stereotyping and cliché lading, I guess.Totally forgettable flick. No enduring images, no memorable lines; no 'we'll need a bigger boat' or here's looking at you kid. No Valkyries, nor choppers. 3 out of 10.

When I finally watched Enchanted about three months ago, I did not like it at all, and could not imagine a second viewing changing my opinion, but since that film is based on the Disney princess movies, I was reminded that even though I had revisited Snow White three years earlier, I didn't have much memory of the Disney versions of Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. After that, it wasn't long before I gave the 1950 release a watch, and I didn't recognize much of it, but still thought it was pretty good. That also turned out to be the case when I watched this 1959 feature.King Stefan and Queen Leah give birth to a daughter, and she is named Aurora. At her christening ceremony, the three good fairies, Fauna, Flora, and Merryweather, come to bless her with one gift each. From Flora, Princess Aurora gets the gift of beauty, and Fauna gives the newborn princess the gift of song, but then the evil Maleficent appears and curses the infant so she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel's spindle and die before sunset on her sixteenth birthday! After the evil fairy leaves, Merryweather still has her blessing to give, and she cannot stop the curse, but she can weaken it. She changes it so when Aurora pricks her finger, she will not die, but will instead fall asleep until she is awakened by true love's kiss. After the ceremony, the three good fairies decide to hide the princess by taking her away from the castle and living as peasants for the next sixteen years, raising her in a woodland cottage. When Aurora, now called Briar Rose, turns sixteen, Maleficent's minions can't seem to find her, but the evil fairy is determined to have her found and have the sinister prophecy fulfilled! Fauna, Flora, and Merryweather make their first appearance in the film near the beginning, and there was something about these characters that made them seem a bit bland to me. Maybe they're supposed to be funnier than I found them to be. The part showing sixteen year old Aurora walking through the forest with her animal friends and singing as Prince Phillip comes nearer gets a little tiring, and so do the scenes showing the fairies trying to make a gown and cake for the princess, though the fight over whether to make the gown pink or blue is funny. Not everything about this version of Sleeping Beauty is that good, but there's still enough to like. The backgrounds are beautiful, especially in the forest, and there are some good moments of comic relief, the first one probably being the first scene showing Maleficent in her castle with her minions, learning that they've been looking for a baby all along. Also, Prince Phillip's father, King Hubert, can be a good character for laughs. There aren't as many laughs here as there are in many other Disney efforts, but there certainly are some. Even with the positive elements I've mentioned, the movie would still be pretty dull for the most part without a good plot which gets exciting, but fortunately, it has that as well.Watching this after Disney's Cinderella, I was expecting it to be better that that film, especially since it isn't the one with the high-pitched talking mice, but after watching them both from start to finish, I would say they're basically equal in quality. Neither is as good as the Disney version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which preceded both of them, but they are decent princess movies for the family nonetheless. So, while I don't think this Sleeping Beauty is the masterpiece many Disney fans might think it is, it's still another entertaining fairy tale adaptation from the early decades of the Disney animated features. I'm quite sure I only ever saw a little bit of this is a kid, which would have been in the 1990s, but I'm sure many viewers through the generations have enjoyed it both as kids and as adults, so as usual with these popular animated movies, this one is not restricted to any specific age group.

I think it's a good movie, especially for the time it was made. It's definitely a significant film, but it just wasn't for me. Easy rider touched on a lot of interesting topics such as hippies and intolerance, communes, and drug use. It was cool to watch the main characters on their quest for freedom, and I thought the film gave an interesting depiction of people from that era. I like to ride a motorcycle myself so at first I really loved the great shots of the open road and the country side. However, constant scenes of the duo's road trip became extremely boring rather quickly. The best parts of the film, or at least my favorites, were the scenes with Jack Nicholson. His character was very entertaining and humorous. I loved when he was talking about space aliens. I've seen a lot of sci-fi films and alien movies, but I had never heard aliens discussed quite that way and with the points he was making. Sadly, after Nicholson's character died I was again very board with the film. Dennis Hopper's character was annoying, although he played him well. I thought Peter Fonda's performance was bland and not very convincing. Also he was often rather emotionally ambiguous, even at crucial moments in the film. It may have been intentional, perhaps to portray the character as being detached and distant, but I didn't like it; it made the movie unnecessarily tough to understand. The whole thing was really drawn out and slow, far too simple, and poorly edited; the whole flash back and forth at every scene transition was just retarded in my opinion.
