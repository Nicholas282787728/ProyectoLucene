There is no Love, there is no Valor, and there is no Compasion. Let's try this instead Self Centered!, Shallow!, Headonistic! I saw this film when it came out in 1997 and as the credits rolled in the theater I wanted to crawl into a hole and pull the hole in after me. Last night I caught parts of it again on cable and immediately started having PTSD symptoms. What a giant pant load. As a gay male, and ballet dancer myself, I cringe to think that people out there might see this vapid movie and think that my life in any way resembles it or any of it's pathetic inhabitants. Sorry to take this personally... This is not a movie about people, gay or otherwise, and their struggles or triumphs. It's about gay cartoon characters. And not very nice ones. Every distasteful stereotype is there. And most of the characters are several all at once. What do they have in common? They are all shallow, self centered, bitchy, immature, and totally lacking in impulse control, which explains the last thing they all have in common, they are all dying of AIDS. And so we have one of two problems here. Either gays are now making movies that perpetuate commonly held negative stereotypes about themselves, in which we have a movie and gay problem. Or, these aren't stereotypes and we gays are really like the way this movie portrays us, in which we have only a gay problem. Either way this movie is just one big problem from start to finish because it's loaded with bad movie making and bad gay characters. When The Boys in the Band opened in the 1960's the gay community, of which Terrence McNally had to have been a part of at the time, was outraged at it's negative portrayal of gay men as stereotypically sad, self loathing, and bitchy. Whatever Mr. McNally's perspective was back then he clearly thinks that stereotypically sad, self loathing, and bitchy was the way to go thirty years later in 1997, and that AIDS would somehow ameliorate the subjects' distastefulness. Not even close. More importantly, all the personal and sociological offenses aside, this is just a really bad, unenjoyable, movie. The house and landscape are beautiful but there is no one to like or care for anywhere to be found. Like too many gay films it trades on shallowness, bitchiness, nudity,and the promise of easy sex. Those can be elements of a film, but they can't BE the film. Follow this if you will. One of the many subplotlines threaded throughout this movie the cute blind guy screws around on his partner, in their own home, with one of their guests, then gets a phone call that his sister had died and launches into an overacted banshee like scream that makes you think he might also be mentally disabled. Then while his lover is comforting him due to the loss of his sister, the cute blind guy thinks it's the perfect time to be honest and tell his lover that he has been schtupping the house guest. And this is fairly routine for this script and this group of characters. And this is not treated like a plot development. It's just one of many random moments, clichés, and stereotypes thrown into this shepherds pie of undeveloped stories and characters. Uhgg...And as for the brain trust behind all this, if this is what passes for talented playwriting and movie making by the gay establishment, God help us all.

Movies like The Hidden make me have a liking to them mainly since they are low-budget and don't require any good CGI but carves out a really fun packed story. If you expect that The Hidden will be boring, bad acting will ruin it, Jack Sholder (Director) doesn't know how to make movies, then it shows that your predicament will definitely be wrong and that's (of course) by a mile. Kyle Maclachlan plays the (SPOILER!!!) quite Altairan who is on Earth to eradicate a fellow alien that takes over human bodies and unleashes evil with it. Michael Nouri is quite the opposite, he is confident in the way he talks, moves, argues, and he surely doesn't back down from a fight. The action in this film never gets depleted because chasing an alien who unleashes hell has to result in a major catastrophe and there will definitely be action in it. The scene which looked fake was probably when the Lieutenant shot the rocket launcher making the flames look really fake. An old Danny Trejo is in this but makes a cameo role, a very small role indeed. Car lovers will see some old-fashioned Ferrari's and an alien who wants one of them but doesn't know how.After an alien in an human body causes havoc in America, FBI agent Lloyd Gallagher and police officer Tom Beck team up to kill the trespasser and stop people from being controlled. As the film progresses you find out a lot of things about your two officers and one of them is not what we think. The story is really great because you can watch the last thirty minutes of the movie and still understand the full story.I really liked the story in this film and it's one of those rare stories that captivate me. The acting is not bad either and the alien looks very cool, nothing like we imagined. Horror is my favorite genre and many people say that this is scary but it is clearly not. How can blowing up stuff be scary? I am really surprised that only five thousand people voted for the film because there should have been more votes for this likable masterpiece. The humorous scene in this movie is when (SPOILER!!!) the dog knocks out the fat guy by bumping his head against the refrigerator. Hilarious! Any film critic or movie lover will like this film since it is already a cult favorite among many viewers. Final Thoughts A really nice crafted movie like this has to be on everyone's list of must-see films because if it isn't they are missing out on something that is very rare.

I was wrong. Very, very wrong.I'm not here to tell you that this is the best movie ever made, I can't do that. Movies are about the meaning they have to your life and one's personal experience defines what you relate to, thus that title will always be different for each individual, but what I can do is tell you about the effect it had on me.First and foremost this is a story about hope. It's not a story about crime & prison, if you adhere to this interpretation then you're not looking deep enough into the themes of the film. Yes, Mr. King uses the story of Andy to communicate his messages, but the narration itself is entirely superficial, this could have just as easily been a story about war, but the conduit he uses is fairly well suited to his goal.The acting is superb, I couldn't think of a better suited cast. Tim Robbins is fantastic as Andy (The main character), and Morgan Freeman is just as good as his friend. The last time I saw acting this good was in The Godfather. You feel for the characters, not only because of the superb acting but also because the character development is so subtle and concise that by the end of the film you feel as if you've known them all your life.I'll elaborate on the allegory portrayed. The film explores such areas as corruption, religion, hope, love & integrity. King suggests that hope is the most important thing in life, and those who have lost it ultimately decay into a sea of mediocrity (as shown through contrast between Brooks & Red). This was the theme I found most interesting and applicable to my life, but the rest are equally as touching. Notice the difference in behavior between those who are religious and those who are not, King hints at a perceived justification for evil in the contrast between Andy & the Warden.Integrity is also portrayed as something delicate and somewhat essential to happiness, like hope. King shows this mainly through the actions of Andy, as embodied in the quote The funny thing is - on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook. (That was not a spoiler, it's fairly obvious that he goes to prison, just by looking at the synopsis)I don't wish to get into the story too much, just keep these themes in mind when you watch the movie and you'll find it infinitely more rewarding.In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption is the best film of the past 20 years, and while it perhaps doesn't deserve that top spot (I'm still deciding, but I doubt I can convince myself to concede it does), it is still an essential movie in my collection and I wouldn't give it up for anything. It's right up there with The Godfather and The Good, The Bad & The Ugly.Themes 100% - Perhaps the best film ever made in this regard.Acting 96% - Fabulous performances all round, characters don't age much though.Story 98% - A classic, the best King adaption by far.Lasting appeal 99% - The only film you can watch 100 times and discover something new each sit through.Influence 92% - Watch it and you'll realize how ripped off it's been.Overall 98% - It doesn't get much better than that.

Tim Robbins is fantastic as Andy (The main character), and Morgan Freeman is just as good as his friend. The last time I saw acting this good was in The Godfather. You feel for the characters, not only because of the superb acting but also because the character development is so subtle and concise that by the end of the film you feel as if you've known them all your life.I'll elaborate on the allegory portrayed. The film explores such areas as corruption, religion, hope, love & integrity. King suggests that hope is the most important thing in life, and those who have lost it ultimately decay into a sea of mediocrity (as shown through contrast between Brooks & Red). This was the theme I found most interesting and applicable to my life, but the rest are equally as touching. Notice the difference in behavior between those who are religious and those who are not, King hints at a perceived justification for evil in the contrast between Andy & the Warden.Integrity is also portrayed as something delicate and somewhat essential to happiness, like hope. King shows this mainly through the actions of Andy, as embodied in the quote The funny thing is - on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook. (That was not a spoiler, it's fairly obvious that he goes to prison, just by looking at the synopsis)I don't wish to get into the story too much, just keep these themes in mind when you watch the movie and you'll find it infinitely more rewarding.In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption is the best film of the past 20 years, and while it perhaps doesn't deserve that top spot (I'm still deciding, but I doubt I can convince myself to concede it does), it is still an essential movie in my collection and I wouldn't give it up for anything. It's right up there with The Godfather and The Good, The Bad & The Ugly.Themes 100% - Perhaps the best film ever made in this regard.Acting 96% - Fabulous performances all round, characters don't age much though.Story 98% - A classic, the best King adaption by far.Lasting appeal 99% - The only film you can watch 100 times and discover something new each sit through.Influence 92% - Watch it and you'll realize how ripped off it's been.Overall 98% - It doesn't get much better than that.

I was wrong. Very, very wrong.I'm not here to tell you that this is the best movie ever made, I can't do that. Movies are about the meaning they have to your life and one's personal experience defines what you relate to, thus that title will always be different for each individual, but what I can do is tell you about the effect it had on me.First and foremost this is a story about hope.

When I watched this movie back in 1997 in the theater I thought after the first hour wow, this can't go wrong! The new born Ripley is an exciting character, because you don't know which side she is on. And Sigourney Weaver - 50 at that time - looked great in leather. Back was the hardware, the non-CGI aliens, the fresh ideas and the great action. The basketball scene and Ripley's confrontation with the previous clones were impressive. The look and feel were right on the spot and the story was exciting. The first part of the movie wasn't flawless I guess. But I could live with the things that annoyed me. The miscasting and overacting of Wynona Ryder for instance. The unnecessary swearing and harsh language by both Ryder and Weaver. The scene in which Ripley suddenly talked in full sentences after her awakening. I could live with that. But it all fell definitely apart when the new alien was shown to us at the end of the movie. Man, were they serious? Was this supposed to be the alien of all aliens? The motha of all mothas? Come on, don't make me laugh!The scene that spoiled it all for me had a great start, though. It began like the climax of Andrzej Zulawski's Possession (1981), a surrealistic European movie in which we saw the beautiful Isabelle Adjani making love to a monster.

To this day I'm still the person who goes and sees family or kids movies opening weekend, they tend to be my favourites. When I re-watched this movie today however, I thought it was just sad. For several reasons. The first was that overall the movie was cheesy and fairly predictable. (I'm not talking so much about the story line because clearly I've seen it before) both the person I watched this with, who had never seen this film, and I cringed throughout the movie at some of the more cheesy lines, actions or phrases. That is what I thought of this movie today, after not seeing it for 15 years. Then there is the whole based on a true story load of crap. This is so far removed from the real story that it shouldn't even be considered based on it whatsoever. In the real story Balto was part of a sled team (and a Siberian Husky, I won't say pure-breed because I really don't know, they have him stuffed in the Cleveland museum and he looks fairly different from todays pure huskies, but I know the breed has changed a lot over time) There were several teams making that run and one other dog (a lead dog on another team) was much more heroic and more impressive overall in my opinion and his name was Togo, he's in the Wasilla museum. That's a whole other story though, I suppose. Bottom line, Balto was one of the dogs who ran, as part of a team, and he was a brave and heroic dog. He was one of many, several dogs died trying to get the medication to Nome and he happened to be the lead dog on the team that had the part of the run where they pulled into town. Luck of the draw. This story is so amazing and dramatic on it's own without creating a whole new story it saddens me to see how far from the truth this one is. I know that when I saw the movie when I was 8 I thought it was accurate (aside from the animated aspect, that the story itself was real) so it bothers me to see yet another amazing story distorted because, well, I'm not sure why. Because someone didn't feel like trying to tell the real one.

The childhood sequences were great, but the story was long, and I guess I felt it lost its way as it went on.A year passed before I saw it again. I had only meant to watch a little bit, and soon found myself sucked into watching the whole thing again. Something just clicked that second time, and the first 40 minutes in particular held a lot more weight. That is why I feel this film, more than any other, NEEDS to be seen multiple times to be understood.This movie is not really about gangsters, or prohibition, or unions. This is all the window-dressing. This movie is about three characters Noodles, Max, and Deborah. Or rather, it is about one man's life, the two people he loves, and the choices he makes. It is one of the few films that really seems to capture an entire life on screen. And, while this may sound clichéd, it's a story of the American dream, of wasted potential, of the mistakes we make in our lives, of what it is to be an old man. It tells an interesting story in its flashbacks, but then wraps a modern-day story around it that is built on its own mystery. Indeed, the movie is one big puzzle; it's probably the best example of flashback structure ever done on film. Yes, even better than Citizen Kane.The movie has some flaws, mostly because it was conceived on such a vast scale. As you watch it, you definitely get the sense some scenes are missing, and that some characters (Patsy, Cockeye, and Eve, in particular) feel underdeveloped. However, the movie is able to get away with this because what it DOES offer is so strong, and Robert DeNiro's performance, so unstated, is so good. Despite its long run-time, it's actually a very tight story; nearly every scene is about Noodles, and that's why it is so intimate a portrait.From a technical standpoint, you also have excellent art direction, costumes, and Ennio Morricone's best score. Deborah's Theme is one of the finest pieces ever composed. Also, no one ever mentions the cinematography, which is so rich, particularly in the childhood scenes.It's interesting that I've never been a fan of Sergio Leone's westerns.

The childhood sequences were great, but the story was long, and I guess I felt it lost its way as it went on.A year passed before I saw it again. I had only meant to watch a little bit, and soon found myself sucked into watching the whole thing again. Something just clicked that second time, and the first 40 minutes in particular held a lot more weight. That is why I feel this film, more than any other, NEEDS to be seen multiple times to be understood.This movie is not really about gangsters, or prohibition, or unions. This is all the window-dressing. This movie is about three characters Noodles, Max, and Deborah. Or rather, it is about one man's life, the two people he loves, and the choices he makes. It is one of the few films that really seems to capture an entire life on screen. And, while this may sound clichéd, it's a story of the American dream, of wasted potential, of the mistakes we make in our lives, of what it is to be an old man. It tells an interesting story in its flashbacks, but then wraps a modern-day story around it that is built on its own mystery. Indeed, the movie is one big puzzle; it's probably the best example of flashback structure ever done on film. Yes, even better than Citizen Kane.The movie has some flaws, mostly because it was conceived on such a vast scale. As you watch it, you definitely get the sense some scenes are missing, and that some characters (Patsy, Cockeye, and Eve, in particular) feel underdeveloped. However, the movie is able to get away with this because what it DOES offer is so strong, and Robert DeNiro's performance, so unstated, is so good. Despite its long run-time, it's actually a very tight story; nearly every scene is about Noodles, and that's why it is so intimate a portrait.From a technical standpoint, you also have excellent art direction, costumes, and Ennio Morricone's best score. Deborah's Theme is one of the finest pieces ever composed. Also, no one ever mentions the cinematography, which is so rich, particularly in the childhood scenes.It's interesting that I've never been a fan of Sergio Leone's westerns.

Unknown to them, the killer is inside the building and the first one to die has the only key outside hidden. This could be their last night alive.Michele Soavi has made one of the greatest horror films of all time with Dellamorte Dellamore, and this one -- his first feature -- is not far behind. The acting is superb, the directing keen, and while the slasher genre is riddled with plenty of bland entries, particularly by the time this came out, Soavi keeps it fresh and new here. I have the utmost respect for his work, and the slasher genre in general... could this be the ultimate slasher? Italian horror critic Jim Harper calls this film a well-constructed and visually impressive film that stands out as one of the highlights of Italian horror in the late 1980s. I could not agree more. Horror, and Italian horror specifically, has more misses than hits... and by the end of the 1980s was a dying subgenre. Soavi kept the fire alive, at least for a few more years than it would have survived on its own (Argento, as great as he his, cannot bear the entire burden of Italian cinema alone). The visually impressive part is quite true, as Soavi uses colors to his advantage throughout this one... a technique he likely picked up from Argento.Fans will recognize actor John Morghen, whom Harper calls waspish, the darling of the Italian horror world. Sadly, unlike past performances, Morghen dies off relatively early in the film and is not given the on-screen death he deserves. (Interestingly, I read an interview with Morghen where he has trashed the horror film and its fans... one wonders why he has made so many and why he shows up at conventions throughout America.) I have to give credence to Simon Boswell's rocking 1980s score. Some reviewers look back now, and knock Boswell for his inclusion of heavy metal into this and other films (such as Phenomena or the Demons films). Let's be clear, this is not Boswell's doing. The directors at the time did this. I don't really know why. But unlike the others, I don't mind it... it really gives a pumping rhythm to what could otherwise be a slower-feeling film.Fans of horror, slashers, Italian films, Soavi, etc. all need to put this on their list. And if it doesn't already exist, there needs to be a demand for a special edition disc. To my knowledge, there really isn't such a thing yet, and that's a shame. Soavi is often forgotten behind his predecessors, but he is much greater than generally perceived.

Similarly, through the exploration of a feudal system fractured by the hope provoked by an eastern intellectual, Ford observed that the old west could not have existed without the possibility of eventual change. Thus, old and new are as symbiotic as the forces of human nature upon which the film's thematic corps lies. The twin poles (good old and reliable tactics) of the classical western are people and the land. Taken together, they represent the forces of civilization and of nature, each existing uneasily with the other. The structure of most westerns is a series of elaborations on this theme of opposition sheriff versus outlaw, saloon girl versus schoolteacher, settlers versus wilderness, individual versus community. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance was not only one of his last but also his farewell - to the western hero, to the myth of the West - which Ford more than any other filmmaker helped create. We observe from the opening frame that things are slightly off-kilter for the year in which the film was produced the picture is shot in black and white (a novelty at a time when almost every filmmaker tried to shoot in color). The opening credits appear on a series of wooden signs, except they are not actual signs but obvious, almost crude, drawings. And while we see the landscape - consistent with Ford's aesthetic - in the opening shot, this time it is not Monument Valley but a much less heroic vista, and through it travels not a lone cowboy or a stagecoach, but a train. We soon observe by way of the film's use of flashback (eventually flashback within flashback) that The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is about the passage of time &#x96; history - and how we deal with it, factually and mythically. Hence, the film is about how new aspects come to replace old. The film is also about the death of the legend (the closing of a chapter), and as it is suggested not just in Tom's death but also in the artificiality of the sets and the references to stagecoaches (the old vanishing). However, the death of that legend is a grudging one. We know through the motif of the cactus rose that Hallie loved Tom (a symbol of burgeoning life and resilience; the cactus rose is a biological anomaly). And, more importantly, we know that the events of the film occur because of Tom it is Tom who kills Valance, tells Ranse the truth about it, gives up Hallie, and thereby creates Ranse's career. It is Tom who refuses nomination and destroys his (and what was to be Hallie's) home. Thus, Tom anticipates his own obsolescence and gives up power, home, love, and finally his way of life so that Ranse may create community through words and law and politics; Tom's every act is one of denial, sacrifice, almost of suicide. As a matter of plot, the new is predicated upon the old.

But the man can whack a golf ball further than anybody else around, as he finds out by some strange quirk of fate that makes the entire movie possible. So he becomes a golfer. And he becomes quite a celebrity, thanks to his mix of raw talent, unpredictable temper and unorthodox manner. On the one hand, the golf world loves him for boosting ratings but on the other they cannot allow him to carry on with his behaviour unchecked. But Sandler needs to keep playing AND to win against his main rival (Shooter McGavin played by Christopher McDonald) so that he can save his grandmother's home and get her back in there, safe and sound.What can I really say to win people over about this movie? It IS stupid, it IS basically centred around Sandler's angry man-child schtick and it IS of no real cinematic value whatsoever. But, as I said above, it is also hilarious. This and The Waterboy are, arguably, the comedy movies that best worked for Sandler's particular on screen persona and this one edges ahead thanks to it also poking fun at the strait-laced world of golf.Sandler is just fine in the main role, McDonald makes a great nemesis, Carl Weathers is on good form as a wise old golfer who offers to show Happy how to improve and then you have hilarious cameos from people as diverse as Bob Barker and Richard Jaws Kiel.

This and The Waterboy are, arguably, the comedy movies that best worked for Sandler's particular on screen persona and this one edges ahead thanks to it also poking fun at the strait-laced world of golf.Sandler is just fine in the main role, McDonald makes a great nemesis, Carl Weathers is on good form as a wise old golfer who offers to show Happy how to improve and then you have hilarious cameos from people as diverse as Bob Barker and Richard Jaws Kiel. If you approach this movie in the right frame of mind then you really can't go wrong if you're after lots of big laughs.Denis Dugan directs but it's a great concept that needs nothing more than simply being left alone. We get the montage moments, we get the light and enjoyable soundtrack, we get the hilarious outbursts of anger, we even get the tense sports movie cliché finale. Seen it all before? Yeah, but it's rarely been quite so funny.See this if you like Caddyshack, The Waterboy, Billy Madison.

In fact the movie lacked females altogether, which seems to be quite rare in today's movies.

Ironically, for a movie that undoubtedly shares much of its audience with those who loved Fiddler On the Roof, it tries to undo the social revolution that drove Fiddler's plot; Delancey suggests that a Jewish woman might be better off relying on matchmakers and familial authority figures than actively choosing her own spouse, a job she only seems to mess up when it is entrusted to her. And while she's at it, maybe she should rethink her life in the non-Jewish world and come back home. You've come a long way, baby, but what did it get you? For the record, I believe women are best off finding their own mates, and preferably from a set that is larger than two. But what I find most troublesome in this movie is not so much the implied counterargument as the fact that it is made poorly. I can imagine a movie where a woman rejects her background, is miserable alone, encounters repeated disappointment in the Gentile world, and finally returns to her grandmother's milieu to find true fulfillment, romantic and otherwise. It might be done as propaganda; it might be done as a persuasive, touching story. But Crossing Delancey doesn't make a serious effort to do it at all. Izzy never really rejects her background in the first place, never comes across as particularly lonely or unhappy, and only undergoes a single unpleasant romantic failure. Then, when she does surrender to the man who has been preselected for her, the movie fails to make a convincing case that she will truly be happy. Sam is pleased with how things work out. Izzy's grandmother is ecstatic. It is almost as if the romance is between those two characters, and Izzy is simply the one who, through her sacrifice, allows the match between them to be consummated.It's a pity, because the movie does raise some interesting questions before it rushes to extinguish them. There is a rich potential in the premise of a woman unfairly dismissing a suitor due to how he has been thrown at her, perhaps due even to a small amount of snobbery, only to gradually discover his merits and discover that they are good for each other after all. There are certainly possibilities in the idea of a woman being romanced by a man with what she thinks is an aesthetic sensibility, only to recognize that he exploits people and the artistic impulse alike. It would be interesting to see a character seriously wrestle with which components of the literary world she values and which she decides are simply based on vanity, and the extent to which she reconciles her ongoing involvement in that landscape with her attachment to a man who doesn't fit particularly well into it. There are even interesting minor notes that are never satisfactorily explored how do a woman who has essentially used her friend as a means to flee from a potential relationship, and a man who has taken the bait, reconcile their behavior and their future friendship with her when they push her out of the picture again? But as this is not a movie designed for a sequel, we are not meant to explore those questions further.According to its tag line, Crossing Delancey is a funny movie about getting serious.

From his early outings such as Happy Gilmore (superb) and Billy Madison (dumb fun) to his more recent efforts to date (Funny People, I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry), Sandler has always tickled my funny bone. I think that whether you like Sandler or not really ends up affecting whether or not you enjoy any of his movies because, let's face it, they are HIS movies.Anyway, here Sandler plays Robbie Hart, the wedding singer of the title and a man gifted at making things run smoothly while newlyweds get through their first day. He meets, and finds he enjoys the company of, Julia (played by Drew Barrymore) at one such bash and all seems good. Alas, disaster strikes on his own wedding day and from then on Robbie finds that he no longer has the heart to see others in love while he sings to the crowd. Can he keep his job? Can he reaffirm his belief in love? And will helping Julia prepare for HER upcoming wedding do good or simply cause him more pain as he realises just how much he likes her?It's all really standard romantic comedy stuff but what sets The Wedding Singer apart from the multitude of others around is a) Sandler and Barrymore providing us with two immensely likable lead characters and b) the fun derived from the nostalgia we who lived through the 80s can deliriously hang on to.The script is just witty enough in places to get by while at other times it aims for a big belly laugh (Sandler's angry songs providing the highlights) and this mix makes for a wholly enjoyable time. Throw in plenty of references for those old enough to remember the decade depicted and things gain a whole other layer. Then we get a topping of great supporting characters and top-notch small turns from the likes of Christine Taylor, Allen Covert, Matthew Glave, Steve Buscemi, Alexis Arquette, Jon Lovitz and yes even a certain 80s rocker who I won't reveal here but who does enough to raise a smile without embarrassing himself in the process.Frank Coraci directs with an unfussy, well-paced approach that never interrupts the easy laughs and it's all good enough to provide a lesson in by-the-numbers rom-com gold. Great cast, great characters, great soundtrack, a bit of nostalgia, some great one-liners, the inevitable montage and a Van Halen reference.

Raimi (and also Tobey Maguire himself) has made us believe that Tobey Maguire is Peter Parker\/Spider-Man, despite the original character is much more stalwart and he is not that loser as Peter Parker in this adaptation. What kind of person Peter Parker is? The movie becomes scratchy while asking this question, in other words, the introduction of one of the best Super heroes is unsatisfying. In addition, may be the most important part of the movie, the part which the spider bites Parker and the metamorphosis process were great fun, but something is missing. Can it be a careful direction and a brilliant script? The bite scene take place too early, it is also an ordinary scene from the movie. Spider-Man flies throughout the city, those images are dazzling, then he rests the Gargoyles statue, sometimes he talks with it which is humor. In the movie all these details and more are ignored. The tone and the atmosphere of the movie are very different, so I felt out of things. By the way, the fight in the school, the zooms before that look amateurish. As I know, some people criticize the film so that it is like a teenager movie, in my opinion, it is not, but it has different problems. In some scenes, very bad CGI is an eyesore. I just did not like the wrestling scenes, it is because of Raimi again, the Wolverine fight in X-Men, for example was much more better, excellent. J. Jonah Jameson character is cartoonish, especially in the second movie, he was superficial, but some people think that he is as good and funny as the original character. The action scene with balloons (recalls Batman) is the best action scene of the movie and great fun, too and there is a weird image that Parker imitates Superman! Lastly, the humor conception, many enemies versus Spider-Man fantasy, character development, story editing, lack of detail etc. are problematic. Spider-Man often puts his camera somewhere in the crime scene in order to take money from J. Jonah Jameson. Sometimes, the camera crumbles, but sometimes he succeeds in delivering the photos. Or Spider-Man is a chatterbox, he often talks with himself while flying or fighting his enemies. Sometimes, he makes jokes about the situation he is in etc. None of them is here! Spider-Man is a feel yourself good movie and one of the most entertaining movies, but fails as a Spider Man movie.

Jonah Jameson character is cartoonish, especially in the second movie, he was superficial, but some people think that he is as good and funny as the original character. The action scene with balloons (recalls Batman) is the best action scene of the movie and great fun, too and there is a weird image that Parker imitates Superman! Lastly, the humor conception, many enemies versus Spider-Man fantasy, character development, story editing, lack of detail etc. are problematic. Spider-Man often puts his camera somewhere in the crime scene in order to take money from J. Jonah Jameson. Sometimes, the camera crumbles, but sometimes he succeeds in delivering the photos. Or Spider-Man is a chatterbox, he often talks with himself while flying or fighting his enemies. Sometimes, he makes jokes about the situation he is in etc. None of them is here! Spider-Man is a feel yourself good movie and one of the most entertaining movies, but fails as a Spider Man movie.

Raimi (and also Tobey Maguire himself) has made us believe that Tobey Maguire is Peter Parker\/Spider-Man, despite the original character is much more stalwart and he is not that loser as Peter Parker in this adaptation. What kind of person Peter Parker is? The movie becomes scratchy while asking this question, in other words, the introduction of one of the best Super heroes is unsatisfying. In addition, may be the most important part of the movie, the part which the spider bites Parker and the metamorphosis process were great fun, but something is missing. Can it be a careful direction and a brilliant script? The bite scene take place too early, it is also an ordinary scene from the movie. Spider-Man flies throughout the city, those images are dazzling, then he rests the Gargoyles statue, sometimes he talks with it which is humor. In the movie all these details and more are ignored. The tone and the atmosphere of the movie are very different, so I felt out of things. By the way, the fight in the school, the zooms before that look amateurish.
