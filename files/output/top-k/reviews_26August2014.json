Other movies about this subject are Blackboard jungle (1955) , Class of 1984 (1984) , Stand and deliver (1988) ,Lean on me (1989) , Dangerous Minds (1995) , The Substitute (1996) , High School High (1996) ,187 (1997).The best way to look at this movie is to look at it as unusual western. The lines between good and evil are very clear and there are no real moral dilemmas here. Some people might criticize that this movie is sometimes over the top , especially the action scenes. However I don' t think that this movie is too far from the real life problems. The reality is a lot worse. In my country there have been accidents in last years where teachers were attacked by aggressive teenagers . The problem of bullies , school violence and street gangs existed in 1987 and is even a bigger issue now. I agree with the message of The Principal &#x96; some kids you can reach to , but some are just lost case. Some punks only understand violence. Some hooligans can be saved by reaching out to them, but some will only understand baseball bat. In a way you could say it's a teacher fantasy , but one that makes you feel better. I believe that a teacher in school should be untouchable and every punk who doesn't know how to behave should get a serious ass kicking.I also don't believe that the movie is racist. Yes , the main villain is black , but we have also a white creep White Zac (JJ Cohen) here and few Latino gangsters. The janitor and female teachers who help Latimer are black and don't forget that there is one black Baby Emile (Troy Winbush) and Latino kid Raymi Rojas (Esai Morales )who become friends with Latimer. Most of the kids in this movie isn't portrayed as bad , they just apathetic and the same goes for almost every teacher in Brandel.James Belushi (Red heat) fits the main role of Rick Latimer incredibly well. He's totally endearing and very likable character from start to finish. It was refreshing to see a teacher who isn't so noble and more down to earth. The film gives him the chance to mix serious drama with his comedy talent. Louis Gossett Jr. (Officer and gentleman) gives a admirable support as believable tough security guard Jake Philips. The relationship between Belushi and Gossett Jr. is fun to watch thanks to some great chemistry between them. Michael Wright (The Wanderers) is quite convincing as the main villain Victor Duncan and Rae Dawn Chong (Commando) is fine in her role of impassioned teacher Hilary Orozco . The students played by JJ Cohen , Troy Winbush , Esai Morales are also very OK.It feels strange to write about action scenes in a movie about inspiring teacher , but the truth is that they are done nicely and the climax of the movie is full of suspense . Director Christopher Cain (Young guns) did a good job. The screenplay was written by Frank Deese, a real life teacher who also plays a small role in the movie. The story gives enough time for character development and material for actors to work with. Some nice and memorable one liners here I will expel you , No more , He's the principal man. The only problem is the undeveloped role for Rae Dawn Chong and her friendship\/love story with Latimer. It doesn't seem to go anywhere like the writer didn't knew what to do with her. Some cliché moments at the end of movie , but I didn't minded them. The soundtrack is nice , especially if you like 80's music . Notable songs &#x96; Strafe Set it off , Jay Gruska \/Bruce Roberts \/ Andy Goldmark Livin in the line of fire and Rob Jungklas Hello heaven.The Principal might be a B-class movie , but it's a well made B-class movie. It has some good messages and is a positive movie . It's entertaining and actually inspiring. It's a movie how few people can make a difference. It does quite good job portraying the hard work many teachers have to face every day. It's a movie about fighting apathy and doing what you think is right no matter what.

The issue was, I was kind of disappointed. I think my biggest issue was that I just didn't find it all that funny. Sure, it has it's moments, but compared to other comedy films with this topic, I laughed a lot less. I know a lot of the comedy is more subtle, but I just don't think there's enough of it.The biggest strength of this film is its general realism concerning teenage life and people involved in that world. The characters all feel like real people you would meet and not you're typical unoriginal characters like the nerd or the jock. It also handles a few topics such as conformity and wanting to be free, which are always on the mind of teenagers. But the issue is that I feel like these topics are more handled towards the end and should have been more prevalent throughout. Many performances are great too, a big stand out being Matthew McConaughey. Even Ben Affleck is great in this. I think that perhaps the realism to it's characters and situations will make this movie become better the more that I re-watch it.As mentioned before, my big gripe was the comedy. There just wasn't enough for me. Moments just felt flat or made me question whether I should be laughing or not. Also another issue was relating to the whole 70s setting, which while I think was extremely well done for a 90's movie, hurt my relating to the film because I wasn't even born in the 70s (although it allows for some awesome music for the soundtrack.) I personally find I can relate to John Hughes films, even if I wasn't born in the 80s, so its disappointing to not get that from this film. If John Hughes could do it, I wish Linklater could have. In my opinion, a film that is extremely similar to this film that I can relate more too and I found funnier would be Superbad. A lot of the same themes are in both films, and both are comedies, but Superbad ends up being more relatable to me. The only advantage Dazed And Confused has is that its more grounded in reality and deals with a few more though provoking themes that Superbad, a very goofy and sometimes slapstick kind of film, doesn't really have going on.In my opinion, I understand why this film is well known. I just didn't get the experience that I wanted to get. I watch Superbad or The Breakfast Club and i'm able to laugh and relate, and I just didn't get that as much here. I do hope that I am able to watch this again in the future and have it grow on me, because I have this feeling that it needs repeated viewing to fully be appreciated.

Firstly, the intended star, Patrick Swayze dropped out to make Road house instead , then principal photography began without a completed script. Sylvester Stallone had the original director of photography Barry Sonnenfeld fired and replaced by Donald E. Thorin. Then, the director, Andrey Konchalovskiy was fired by producer Jon Peters and replaced by Albert Magnoli. The official reason is that Konchalovskiy went 20 million $ over budget (which is true) , but the unofficial reason were the creative differences between Peters and Konchalovskiy (producer wanted to make a spoof , director wanted more serious movie). Stallone was working unofficially as producer, director and writer and held the project together. The film had to be completely reedited by Stuart Baird prior to its release. It explains why some of scenes from the trailer are deleted. Gary Chang provided additional music to the film because Harold Faltermeyer could not return to re-score the final reel of the film as it was constantly being edited. Behind the scenes work must have been an absolute nightmare , yet the ending result is an incredibly entertaining piece of kitsch. Tango and Cash is as good as it gets when it comes to cheesy, violent, exciting action movie escapism. It's not a serious film and it nearly verges on parody. It shouldn't be viewed in a conventional way &#x96; the characters are one-dimensional, one-liners appear every minute, plot is illogical and unrealistic , etc. There's nothing innovative (OK , they aren't partners, but city rivals )or special about the film, it's nothing we haven't seen before , but the film is entertaining as hell.From the very beginning we are experiencing a live action cartoon atmosphere . The characters are larger than life and the overall atmosphere is nicely over the top. Tango and Cash not only parodies other films of this genre (Lethal weapon , Police story) , but also realizes that it's silly and makes fun of itself. Director Andrey Konchalovskiy keeps the movie moving along at a nonstop breakneck pace. There isn't a SINGLE dull moment here , the energy is never dropped .The action is loud and over the top in delicious way ( the final showdown at warehouse feels like a computer game). The witty script by Randy Feldman has tons of memorable and quotable one liners and dialogue ( I'd pay cash to see this tango , FUBAR , Ok, let's do it , Rambo is a pussy). The chemistry between Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell is FANTASTIC. The banter is so good and quick and feels completely natural. They make an excellent team. Stallone wears real glasses (his own) and is convincing as the gentleman cop , while Russell steals the show as the cop with too much energy. The supporting cast is good too . Teri Hatcher is HOT , Jack Palance and Brion James are fun villains. It was also good to see Geoffrey Lewis and James Wong.The cinematography by Donald E. Thorin is slick , while Harold Faltermeyer creates a funky and catchy soundtrack (the main theme !). There are 2 great songs here  Yazoo Don't go and Bad English Best of what I got. There is lot of destruction and humor.Tango and Cash delivered what it promised popcorn entertainment. It's pure escapism and fun. It shouldn't be taken too seriously (just like Indiana Jones movies). Big action and hilarious banter between the two leads ensure full satisfaction on every viewing. It's a masterpiece of brainless entertainment and the true essence of a guilty pleasure, which really deserved a sequel.

I had little interest in seeking the movie out until a scene in Marvel Studios' sci-fi romp GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY (2014) piqued my curiosity.It turns out the movie is just not very good. I don't know much about the character of Howard the Duck from the comic books, but this movie almost surely doesn't do him justice.First of all, the duck suit looks silly. As much as I like practical effects, CGI is the way to go with a character like Howard (an anthropomorphic cartoon-style duck let loose in a world of humans). In the days before CGI, the best solution might have been a mix of animation and live action à la WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT (1988). The animatronic duck head is impressive from an engineering standpoint, but the design doesn't sell Howard as believable in the context of the film.The opening scene showing photographs of Howard's duck family and duck friends, dressed up like people, introduces an air of ludicrosity that the film is hopeless to recover from.The writing is another disappointment. I always imagined Howard to be a duck with attitude, but the movie Howard lacks an edge. He's an everyman, a responsible, emotionally mature adult duck given to sarcastic quips and occasional shrieks of cowardice. The dialogue is weak all around, and the script is overflowing with groan-inducing duck puns.Rather than use the character of Howard the Duck for something satirical, metatextual, or otherwise unconventional, the film gives us a straightforward fish out of water story about being lost in a strange land and trying to get home. Howard and his armchair are inexplicably plucked from Duckworld and thrust through the cosmos, landing in Cleveland on the planet Earth. The second half of the movie falls into the familiar line of the hero saving the world from an evil villain. Standard comic book movie stuff, albeit with an unlikely hero (a mild-mannered mallard from a distant planet).Lea Thompson from BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985) co-stars as Beverly, a punk rock singer who takes Howard in. A young Tim Robbins plays her lab assistant friend, who helps piece together the mystery of Howard's arrival. Jeffrey Jones plays the scientist who can send him back, with an extra twist. Chip Zien lends his voice to the titular hero, with Ed Gale and others in the suit.Despite being a movie about a talking duck from outer space, HOWARD THE DUCK is not strictly for kids, with adult jokes that would never make it in today's family films.It's an oddball movie, for sure, from the Playduck centerfold to the inter-species romantic tension, and of course the absurdity of a humanoid duck walking around Cleveland. The filmmakers clearly intended the movie to be an offbeat comedy. Unfortunately the jokes aren't as funny as they think they are. The one-liners are painfully cheesy. Tim Robbins's performance is spastic and over-the-top and John Barry's generically heroic score plays like a parody over Howard's awkward Quack-Fu scenes.Famously produced by STAR WARS impresario George Lucas, HOWARD THE DUCK was co-written and directed by Lucas's AMERICAN_GRAFFITI (1975) collaborator Willard Huyck, with Industrial Light and Magic doing the special effects (which are solid for the mid-1980s).

The filmmakers clearly intended the movie to be an offbeat comedy. Unfortunately the jokes aren't as funny as they think they are. The one-liners are painfully cheesy. Tim Robbins's performance is spastic and over-the-top and John Barry's generically heroic score plays like a parody over Howard's awkward Quack-Fu scenes.Famously produced by STAR WARS impresario George Lucas, HOWARD THE DUCK was co-written and directed by Lucas's AMERICAN_GRAFFITI (1975) collaborator Willard Huyck, with Industrial Light and Magic doing the special effects (which are solid for the mid-1980s). Based on a Marvel Comics character, the original concept for the film must've sounded intriguing, but the movie just isn't special enough.

Like most films of this ilk, Richard misreads Florence's performances and simulations as real affection; she genuinely likes him, he thinks. Florence, of course, says she doesn't; it was just an act. Richard is left confused. What's original about the film is this Florence genuinely does love Richard, but will not allow herself to acknowledge or act upon this love. For Florence, the couple's relationship is inherently objectifying, demeaning and social relationships mediated by money, or economic relations themselves, are intrinsically violent. For Florence, Richard's just another boss. Another employer.

But Richard does not see himself in this light. He is a nice guy and genuinely wants to give generously, out of love (or genuinely believes he does). When Florence rejects him, Richard then vengefully becomes a caricature of what Florenence perceives him to be. He turns her over and violently has sex (rapes?) with her. Ironically, this merely affirms Florence's own prejudices (correct assumptions?).The Centre of the World ends with two symbolic scenes. In the first, Florence masturbates before Richard, and explains that this is what genuine love is. For Florenece, the act is honest and not tainted by the conscious or unconscious power games or depersonalising desires of others. The film then cuts to a strip-club, in which Florence and Richard meet once again. Brilliantly, Wang has each character now fully embrace their customer\/provider, master\/whore roles. Richard pays, Florence dances, end of story. Their transaction is impersonal, cold and each now perceives themselves as being in control.

The Godfather is one of those rare instances where incredible plot meets incredible interpretation. It has Iconic performances to iconic characters. Dialogues that are bursting with quotes, style, and even wisdom. Themes that resonate immediately with anyone family, loyalty, honor, power, revenge, legacy. Etc.The story is essentially an emotional tragedy sprinkled with humor\/fun. It makes us feel for this family. Moments of warmth if you will, largely thanks to characters like Vito (warmth) or Sonny (humor). As such we feel more impact when family members make mistakes that effect the whole. There's also something special about how the film interacts with the viewer, and it's hard to exactly explain what it is; it's an unusual tone. I guess it has something to do with how it all mixes the superb acting, the almost-strange-but-beautiful camera shots, the haunting music. I would argue that it makes the film as a whole haunting.It's just damn perfect.

In my opinion it is one of the funniest movies ever made. In fact the audience was screaming and falling on the floor. The portrayal of God (and I am a Christian) is classic. There was a scene in the movie I will not detail, but you must see the sex scene with the older couple. I will not sugar-coat this--there are some very disturbing situations with drugs. And even though the movie is in English, subtitles were used do to the heavy Scottish accent. This movie is clearly not for everyone, but for its genre--the Trainspotting genre--it is as funny as anything ever made. Also beware of the fairly harsh language. But If you love dark comedies, there is none darker.

This simple plot however brings out emotions and bias from each of the twelve juries. This is backed by stellar performances, especially from Henry Fonda and Lee.J.Cobb who the film centres around. Lee.J.Cobb plays the most complex of the Juries, and his slow descent into his true feelings toward the case are both compelling and believable. There are some Juries that don't really get that do not get that much screen time, but the film makes sure to make them have a key role somewhere. Some may dislike that there is only one location, but I think this allows the film to stay focused and not stray onto another side story, in this way it is very similar to rear window, in that you never see anything that happens from anyone Else's perspective apart from James Stewart perspective. This style helps to keep 12 angry men flowing. Overall this is one of the finest films ever created and has not aged one bit.
