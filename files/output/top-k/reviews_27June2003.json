I'm glad I rented it, too, because this is one of the best thrillers I've seen in years. Like it's title, there's nothing really complex or intricate about it, and it even follows pretty close to the usual thriller plotline, but it is so well acted and written that it thrills and entertains throughout the entire film.The characters are made up mostly of caricatures. Caricatures, in this case, oddly enough, of the actors performing them rather than the role that needed to be filled in the story. Janeane Garofalo plays the part of an FBI agent assigned to investigate the various murders that begin turning up in a small town. Like most of her characters, she is disillusioned, sarcastic, and continually amazed at the sheer idiocy with which she is surrounded. Vince Vaughn delivers a wonderful performance as the villain, with his endless charm making him the perfect actor to play the part of a serial killer. `They're all charming,' as they say.As is often the case, Joaquin Phoenix also plays a rather unenviable role, as he did in movies like 8MM, To Die For, and Gladiator. He is a good guy in Clay Pigeons, but after you watch the movie it becomes obvious that this guy must just have a serious problem with bad luck. A good friend of Clay's (Phoenix) kills himself in a remote location early in the film because of an affair that Clay has been having with his wife, forcing Clay to alter the scene to make it look like an accidental death in order to avoid looking like he did it to get rid of him so that he could be with his wife.It's strange to notice the absolute absence of any kind of remorse or sadness that this wife shows after her husband kills himself. Clay is freaking out, and this vicious bitch wants to continue their sexual escapades as though nothing has even happened. When Lester Long (Vaughn) shows up, he strikes up a friendship with Clay and, through a bizarre fishing incident, becomes irreversibly intertwined with Clay's murders. Basically they are stuck working together for the rest of the movie no matter how much Clay's hatred for Lester grows. You'll just have to watch the movie to see why.I thought that the ending was a tiny bit of a copout, if only because it involves a situation at a distant roadside diner\/café that ends too perfectly. This situation just had way too many variables that could have happened to have come off exactly as it was expected to, but the movie was still so good that it is more than worth it. If you are looking for a great thriller (and you've already seen The Way of the Gun), Clay Pigeons is the way to go.

This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father's Little Dividend (1951), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it's unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don't think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (1991), Bryan's parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it's funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.

It's been needlessly ripped off, and endlessly spoofed since its release in 1989. In fact, this year's Dumb and Dumberer When Harry Met Lloyd is even a pun on it. At least the title, anyway.Many people will tell you the plot is weak, but the movie is good because of characters. Okay, well, I disagree. I think the plot, the characters and the script all work together to form an excellent romantic comedy. Whether it be the irony in the script, the characters' quirks or the smart, snappy, crisp dialogue thrown between Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan, When Harry Met Sally not only meets every expectation, but exceeds.The film opens up with Harry Burns (Crystal) and Sally Albright (Ryan) driving to New York. Sally is best friends with Harry's girlfriend, Amanda. As they drive along, Harry and Sally start getting into a heated debate over Casablanca. This discussion ends in discussing something a bit more risque If men and women can sleep together and still be friends in the morning. Harry's standpoint is a no. Sally says yes. Harry explains that no man can be friends with a woman that he finds attractive. He always wants to have sex with her. Sally replies, So, you're saying that a man can be friends with a woman he finds unattractive? Harry comes back with, No. You pretty much want to nail 'em too.That's the kind of dialogue you get a lot in this movie. If you want to compare Crystal's character to another fictional one, it would be George from Seinfeld. George has all these intricate theories worked out about everything, from double-dipping to violating the splash zone. (If you've seen the episode I'm talking about you'll get it.) Harry Burns is the same way. Only his theories are all on sex, and\/or the differences between men and women. You could call him pessimistic. He admits he has a dark side. Sally says, I have as much of a dark side as the next person. Harry replies, When I get a new book, I read the last page first so I know what happens in case I die. That, my friend, is a dark side. Funny, I do the same thing and I've never really thought about it.Writer Nora Ephron based her screenplay on none other than the director of the film - Rob Reiner - and his love life. She sat down with him and another person once, and listened intently to his stories. According to her, she then coughed up a screenplay, handed it to Rob, and they made the film.Rob Reiner is one of the most talented and dependable directors in Hollywood. He adds a certain innocence, a certain charm, and a certain chemistry to his films that is hard to miss. His last great (or very good) film was The American President, but everyone finds themself in a ditch after a while, and I think as far as directors go, Reiner was one of the most consistently dependable directors during the eighties and nineties. Check this out This is Spinal Tap, The Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally, Misery, Sleepless in Seattle, The American President All very good - some great - motion pictures that have become as famous as I don't know what.Coming to the cast, Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are an absolute comic and romantic pairing. Every line is real. Every inch of attraction doesn't seem artificial. I swear that the first fifteen minutes of this film has some of the most interesting, engaging and downright smart dialogue I have ever seen in a film. Crystal and Ryan - especially Crystal - really break down everything and kind of make rules out of everything.

Besides, Jason still kills a whole lot of people for no other reason than to kill them and that's alright with me.I wouldn't give this movie much more than 2\/4 stars, just because it's a cheesefest, but in comparison to other Friday movies, it stacks up. Besides, its fun and sometimes when you go and rent a flick, you just wanna have some fun.

He portrayed such a strong character that was going through tough times. Jerry O'Connell's character Vern is the fat kid, but has his own strengths and ideas. Teddy is the kid that almost got his entire ear burnt of by his father. Corey Feldman was awesome in this movie (not to mention when he strips, drools). And last but certainly not least is River Phoenix. He is so believable in this part. I cried when he cried. River was such a strong actor, it was incredibly sad when he died. His character Chris is a kid that smokes and has family problems, yet he overcomes them to become a Lawyer.***SPOILER ALERT***  The end of this movie really cofused me. I wasn't sure if Chris and Gordie has something going on as in I'll see ya. Not if I see you first. I don't know, I wish it would have made more scence at the end. Oh well. And when Chris died, jeez that was hard.This movie was so sweet, I couldn't wait to watch it again. I reccomend this movie to anyone who loves coming of age movies.

While it did have a good storyline, worthy of a film noir, and some very good performances, especially by William H.

What made it intolerable for me was the amount of quirkiness that was injected into every single character, scene, and situation. Taken alone, each little quirk is not a big deal, but after so many of them, one after another, it just gets too much to stomach.Some examples...The title The movie takes place mostly in Minneapolis (which isn't quirky enough -- that's where the Mary Tyler Moore Show took place, after all), and Brainerd (and nobody would go see a movie called Brainerd). About 5 minutes of screen time were set in Fargo, and Fargo has a quirky-enough sound.True story Just because a story is true, does that make it a better story? There is both good and bad fiction and non-fiction. So, what is gained by lying about whether a story is true or not? Quirkiness! See, if you believe this story is true, then all this quirkiness must be true too!Names Character names were given as Grimsrud, Lundegaard, Showalter and Gunderson. Apparently, Scandinavian-sounding names (especially with a double-a) are much quirkier than Pryce, Lopez, Rossi and Sheppard.The weather The snow and the cold serve no purpose but to make the characters put on parkas and snow boots, which make them look quirky. For instance, when the policeman was talking with the man shoveling his driveway, and had to put his hood up so far you couldn't see his face. Quirky! However, anyone who lives in a cold climate knows that when the sky is that grey and the snow is as wet as the stuff he was shoveling, it isn't all that cold...Accents Whether or not people actually talk like that, what's the point of everyone talking like some country bumpkin, even the ones in the fairly large city of Minneapolis? Accents quirky. No accents not quirky.Pregnancy Apart from making the lead character wobble when she walked, and to give her a convenient excuse to throw up every once in a while, what exactly was the point of making the police chief pregnant? Ah yes, another quirk.The old friend A cop meeting an old high school flame at a bar. Sounds kinda dull, right? Well, let's quirk it up a bit. Make the cop a woman -- no, wait a pregnant woman. Make the guy Oriental. Make it totally unnecessary to the plot. Now we're talkin' quirky!By the time we get to the end, we're almost surprised that Macy's character sold plain old GM cars instead of Austin Minis or VW Beetles. The whole thing feels like the directors had no confidence in the subject matter, so they slathered on layer after layer of quirks in the hope the audience wouldn't notice.In the end, it just becomes an exercise in frustration, as a movie that had everything going for it just turns you off after one wink and a poke in the ribs too many.

Acting out Shakespeare well is already a hard task but actually directing, producing and as well writing the screenplay and playing a Shakespearean character is a tremendous feat; and the one doing all this, is Kenneth Branagh.   This film is amazing with its great acting, costumes, music and the beautiful gardens are a major plus as well.  Standing out from the rest of the other characters are the bickering, witty Benedick and Beatrice, marvellously acted by Kenneth Branagh and his then-wife, Emma Thompson. Denzel Washington plays Don Pedro, prince of Arragon and lord to Benedick and Claudio and Robert Sean Leonard plays the easily-lead Claudio, Kate Beckinsale plays the honest Hero and Michael Keaton is the bumbling constable, Dogsberry.  The only problem with the film is the lack of effort from Keanu Reeves' Don John, who is Don Pedro's half-brother. Shakespeare wanted Don John to be a sort of cold hearted villain, something like Hans Gruber from the movie, 'Die Hard', I can hardly hear a word from Don John, it sounds as if he's talking to himself rather than giving orders around to his henchmen, Borachio and Conrade, I don't blame Keanu Reeves' for trying, but this is definitely not a film you want to watch him in if you're a Keanu Reeves' fan.   The scenes played out in the film are touching, detailed and full of energy but one of my favourite scenes was when Benedick overhears Don Pedro, Leonato and Claudio that Beatrice loves him, which of course is a lie but of course Benedick doesn't know this but believes it anyway. (If you watch the film I guess you'll understand why.)    The music was lovely, composed by the celebrated composer Patrick Doyle, the two songs, one of them which I think is called, 'Hey nonny nonny' and the other was played at Hero's memorial service was memorable and I couldn't stop humming the tune 'Hey nonny nonny' for a few days after watching the film.   The last shot in the film where everyone is singing and dancing must be mentioned, it's a long continuous shot, without any editing or cutting and it's breathtaking, it weaves through the courtyard, and then looks up at the balconies and there's confetti falling all over the place, then we follow Benedick, Beatrice, Claudio and Hero into the gardens and the film finishes with a bird's eye view of everyone joining hands, dancing and singing.

The scenes played out in the film are touching, detailed and full of energy but one of my favourite scenes was when Benedick overhears Don Pedro, Leonato and Claudio that Beatrice loves him, which of course is a lie but of course Benedick doesn't know this but believes it anyway. (If you watch the film I guess you'll understand why.)    The music was lovely, composed by the celebrated composer Patrick Doyle, the two songs, one of them which I think is called, 'Hey nonny nonny' and the other was played at Hero's memorial service was memorable and I couldn't stop humming the tune 'Hey nonny nonny' for a few days after watching the film.   The last shot in the film where everyone is singing and dancing must be mentioned, it's a long continuous shot, without any editing or cutting and it's breathtaking, it weaves through the courtyard, and then looks up at the balconies and there's confetti falling all over the place, then we follow Benedick, Beatrice, Claudio and Hero into the gardens and the film finishes with a bird's eye view of everyone joining hands, dancing and singing. Spectacular.   This film is absolutely brilliant and I throughly reccommend it, hats off for Kenneth Branagh for this delightful and wonderfully romantic comedy, Shakespeare must be smiling somewhere...

Apparently, director Simon West decided he'd hold off the typical gun fights, car chases, and big explosions until the last half-hour. Big mistake. This is a Jerry Bruckheimer production, and I don't expect to have to wait 90 minutes to get to the action, which even then, is extremely disappointing in how routine all of it turns out to be.So, instead, it might be more applicable to view this as a comedy about a relatively simple situation that goes awry. After all, this whole mess begins when an army ranger named Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) defended his pregnant wife and killed a man. Even though he was just defending himself and his wife and pleads guilty, he still gets the maximum sentence because he's seen as a deadly weapon in the judge's eye. It's too bad Cage, normally an okay actor, plays his role like a mix between Elvis and Forrest Gump, and as if to make the latter more obvious, Poe's best friend is none other than Mykelti Williamson, AKA Bubba! This Poe Fella and his buddy manage to get on board a plane full of the most dangerous criminals alive (meaning a good number of these inmates are all from the same prison!), who come up with an escape plan that's executed perfectly despite them having never even set foot on the plane before. Poe has to try and thwart them, and this goes on for pretty much the entire movie. So what we have here is a film with a lame protagonist, even lamer villains, and average action scenes that don't get the pulse pounding. Oh, yeah, and there's constant bickering between John Cusack and Colm Meaney over whether or not to shoot the plane down. The answer should be a no-brainer, but since that description fits the movie itself, you can guess what they decide to do with the plane.I get a lot of amusement over the family reunion in the movie's final scenes, where Poe meets his wife and his daughter, whom he's never seen before. Though probably intended as heart-rending drama, this reunion is about as well-handled as something you might see on the Lifetime Channel, maybe even worse.(Spoiler) Take a look at the scene where Malkovich's villain is killed. It's pretty obvious he falls in such a position so that his feet, and not his head, would be facing that crushing machine. This is the kind of haphazard editing that's displayed throughout the whole film, so it's of no surprise Simon West would go on to direct Lara Croft Tomb Raider, the worst film of 2001. Hey, I actually see that as a good thing, since it kept West from directing Black Hawk Down, which was, ironically enough, the best film of 2001.

The film tries going both ways, but the result is a puzzling one to say the least. One thing that it avoids doing is falling into plot-holes, becoming predictable or using average movie clichés. This is done by creating thoroughly flawed but also very compelling characters that certainly aren't your average stereotypes. And they are lifted off paper by exceptional performances from the three Oscar nominated lead players.Nick Nolte (Affliction, The Prince of Tides) gives yet another top-notch performance as the untrustworthy hobo. Jeff Bridges (The Last Picture Show, The Contender) is also very good as his polar opposite- the eccentric millionaire.

Albert Finney (Tom Jones, Erin Brockovich) makes great support, but Catherine Keener (Being John Malkovich) gives the blandest and most over-rated performance. Not only is her part boring and un-necessary, but she even over-acts in certain scenes.Unfortunately, there are some evident flaws scattered around here and there. The `big twist' is uninteresting and it's ironic that Sharon Stone and Jeff Bridges are never on the screen at the same time- After all, their characters are supposed to be husband and wife! But the brilliant acting alone makes `Simpatico' qualify as a good if un-remarkable movie. The script is below average and sometimes the movie ventures into blandness, but most other aspects are good as expected. My IMDb rating 6.1\/10.

I'm 31, male, and try very hard to keep my emotions under wraps. It takes a very special movie to get any kind of real emotion out of me. In other words, I pretty much don't cry at movies. I saw A Walk to Remember on HBO last weekend. I put it on basically as background as I was working, but it totally sucked me in.  By the end I was balling my eyes out.I had previously dismissed it as a typical teen chick flick. But it's so much more. It's a story of how one person's life can completely alter another's life. It's a story about finding faith, finding love, and holding onto that love through life's toughest challenges.Not to say that it's perfect. It certainly has its flaws (many of them, actually). But taken as a whole, it is one of those stories that can truly change you. As Landon says to his mother, Jamie makes me want to become different, better This movie does the same.

I have not laughed so hard during a movie lately and I love how it is not one of the All-the-same romantic comedies that we always seem to see. Danny Boyle is pure genius! McGregor was great in this movie and i think stole the show. From the throwing the robot to the wall to digging his own grave, i laughed soo hard. The only thing i did not like about the movie was Cameron Diaz's singing. Ewan's was great, but she needed a little work. McGregor and Diaz have great chemistry, and i think should work together again! I laughed and laughed and laughed, and McGregor never stopped screaming, from the bank to the car rides!! In all the movies i've seen him in i've never seen him quite play someone like that before! Quite surprising! Overall I loved it and give it a 9.5 out of 10 since Diaz's singing!!
