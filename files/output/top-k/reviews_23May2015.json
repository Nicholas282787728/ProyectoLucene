The scenes with Nicole Eggert and James Remar conversing are the most enjoyable in the film. I think costumes could have used a little more work. All of the characters wore furs and pieces of leather crudely patched together, but for some reason Miss Eggert's costume didn't look quite right and appeared unduly cumbersome for a kid to wear; probably should have tried some different styles for her and the handful of other young people in the film. At the other extreme, it seemed kind of odd for men to be out hunting muskox wearing practically nothing at all. Okay, maybe the Arctic isn't always freezing, but muskox live only in the Arctic and like the cold. Along with Quest for Fire, Clan of the Cave Bear is a serious work about the Old Stone Age. Unfortunately, both films fall somewhat short when it comes to truly great cinematic entertainment about our Paleolithic ancestors. The film industry needs to continue trying to meet the challenge.

Whether it be parents to children, unlikely friendships, or just great romance, Crowe always finds a way to get the best out of actors and that always starts with his scripts. Say Anything tells the story of Lloyd, a well mannered 19 year old who lives in the now, and Diane, a valedictorian with everything good coming her way, and how a relationship like that may blossom over the course of the summer before college.Some may shrug at the fact that Lloyd may have no business in being with a girl of her stature, but the film does a nice job of making the romance believable. Having not known each other in high school, Lloyd decides to take his chances and just call and ask her on a date. Of course, she's very hesitant at first but by simply saying he made me laugh was enough for me. It's true, a laugh can go a long way in getting to know something in whatever aspect possible. Now 26 years later you can definitely feel the influence that this film had on coming of age films even to this day. The Spectacular Now takes a similar premise and also was very successful. It's hard to nail a high school film, but Say Anything did a pretty good job. I also appreciated the way they portrayed Diane's relationship with her father. It was clearly a close bond they had, and for 3\/4 of the movie I felt like it wasn't clichéd at all. There wasn't the typical Disney moments of it's my dream dad, not yours. Now, towards the end of the film I think that same relationship was sacrificed for certain plot points. Knowing that the film isn't all that unpredictable, I should have guessed certain things would happen, but I felt like the last third of the movie felt too much like all the other Hollywood films.There are a lot of classic Crowe moments like when Lloyd is constantly getting advice from his close girlfriends or even his guy friends, so there's no shortage of laughs or fun moments. The film also contains a fantastic score and soundtrack, which are also Crowe trademarks.

I had picked up some of it by osmosis through references and parodies in other works but most of it was completely new to me, I'm glad to say. The acting, writing and direction are all of an extraordinarily high standard. It is a wonderfully told epic tale of family, betrayal, vengeance and a twisted sense of honour. As the title character Don Vito Corleone, Marlon Brando gives a fantastic performance which afforded him his second and final Best Actor Oscar, though he did not accept it. The Don is a fascinating character. He prides himself on being a man of honour who values loyalty above everything else and has a strict moral code, albeit an extremely warped one. The family business encompasses murder, gambling, bootlegging and widespread political and judicial corruption and yet he refuses to enter the narcotics trade as he thinks that it will be too messy and lose the family its support among the police and politicians. I generally prefer Brando when he enunciates more clearly as opposed to mumbling but he is very frightening as the soft spoken Don. Truly powerful people do not need to shout all of the time and the Don understands this. He seldom loses his temper, using violence as an instrument after a reasonable offer has been refused. He is an incredibly strong and compelling character and Brando's performance represents some of his best work. Francis Ford Coppola said that he wanted the best actor in the world to play Don Corleone, which meant either Brando or Laurence Olivier. Olivier is one of my absolute favourite actors but I can't imagine him as the Don.In his first major film appearance, Al Pacino is excellent as the Don's youngest son Michael Corleone, another wonderfully compelling character. In his first scene, we are introduced to him as a US Army captain who has just returned from the recently ended World War II. He is the outsider as he is the only member of his family to have attended college and wants no part of the family business. He instead wants a normal life with his girlfriend Kay Adams and this is illustrated by the two of them going Christmas shopping and going to see The Bells of St. Mary's &#x96; in a funny coincidence, that was the first sequel nominated for Best Picture while The Godfather Part II was the second &#x96; in the cinema. However, everything changes after the assassination attempt on the Don and Michael's first involvement with the family business when he murders Sollozzo and McCluskey in the restaurant, one of the best scenes in the film. He spends several years in Sicily, marries a young woman named Apollonia and sees her killed in a car bomb which was meant for him as part of the ongoing war between the Five Families. This experience hardens him and he begins to lose touch with his humanity. He returns to New York City to find that his family is no longer feared as it once was, given that his father has grown weak. The Corleones relocate to Las Vegas and, under Michael's leadership, attempt to legitimise the business but this is mocked by the Nevada based gangster Moe Greene, a thinly veiled version of Bugsy Siegel. It could be argued that Michael does not truly become his own man until after his father's death when he not only establishes himself as the new Don but reestablishes the Corleones as the most feared and powerful crime family. Pacino was deservedly nominated for an Oscar but for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor, which justifiably annoyed him as he had more screen time than Brando.James Caan is likewise excellent as the Don's hotheaded eldest son Sonny whose frequent outbursts provide a great contrast to the measured, reasonable approaches of both his father and Michael and whose very bloody murder provides another of the best scenes in the film. Robert Duvall is extremely good as Tom Hagen, the Don's unofficially adopted German- Irish-American son and the family's consigliere who is often the voice of reason. A very young Diane Keaton is impressive in the supporting role of the initially naive Kay, who undergoes a steep learning curve in the brilliant final scene when she realises that Michael was lying when he said that he did not have his brother-in-law Carlo killed. The film has a very strong cast overall John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Abe Vigoda (along with Brando, one of the few non-Italian-Americans playing one in the film), Richard Conte (who was considered for Don Corleone), Richard S. Castellano, Al Lettieri, John Marley, Alex Rocco and Coppola's sister Talia Shire. Although Shire is a little over the top in the last scene, she is excellent in the extremely unpleasant scene in which Connie breaks down and Carlo beats her. The film's cinematography is beautiful. I particularly loved the frequent use of shadow and darkness. The long takes, one of my favourite film techniques, are not of the same duration as in the films of Orson Welles or Kenneth Branagh but they are used very effectively. My absolute favourite scene in the film is the baptism of Connie's son Michael which is interspersed with a series of brutal murders. Not only is it shot in a fantastic way but it provides another great contrast as well as illustrating Michael's descent.Overall, this is an absolutely brilliant film which lives up to the hype.

The long takes, one of my favourite film techniques, are not of the same duration as in the films of Orson Welles or Kenneth Branagh but they are used very effectively. My absolute favourite scene in the film is the baptism of Connie's son Michael which is interspersed with a series of brutal murders. Not only is it shot in a fantastic way but it provides another great contrast as well as illustrating Michael's descent.Overall, this is an absolutely brilliant film which lives up to the hype. ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"23 May 2015","score":"","review":" Touch of Evil (1958)**** (out of 4)Wonderful film noir deals with a murder, a drug lord and a kidnapping. All of this centering around police Captain Quinlan (Orson Welles) who will stop at nothing to find the guilty and Mexican detective Mike Vargas (Charlton Heston) who finds himself in the mix after his wife (Janet Leigh) is brought up on charges.TOUCH OF EVIL is a legendary film in the genre but it's also yet another troubled production for director Orson Welles. Today everyone knows the story but this was yet another film that Welles turned in only to have the studio step in and make countless edits to it. Thankfully most of the original footage was saved and was able to be put together years after Welles' death. This 112-minute director's cut is certainly a masterpiece in the genre and it's just amazing to look at the picture today and think that there was a need to chop it up back on its original release. Thankfully Welles got a lot of praise before his death and thankfully for fans some of his work has been completed since then.It's easy to see what a genius Welles was just by watching this movie because there are some marvelous and technically magically moments here. Everyone knows about the opening sequence and it really doesn't matter how many times you see it, you can't help but have your breathe taken away by its beauty. This entire sequence is something that you'd expect to see in an Alfred Hitchcock movie but the technical marvel is something that I don't think even that legend could have pulled off. Another marvelous sequence is the one where Leigh is in a motel room being terrorized by a Mexican gang. This sequence is full of suspense and the cinematography is flawless as we imagine a lot worse happening to her than what we're really seeing. Then, the ending, is just brilliantly played out. I certainly won't ruin it but it's a blast.Then there are the performances. For my money this here is the greatest acting performance that Welles ever gave. He plays a beaten down, dirty cop and the actor certainly went all out for the role. He wore a fake nose, didn't shave and added a fake gut to help him look the part and his transformation is right on the level of that of Marlon Brando in THE GODFATHER. Welles really gives an incredibly strong performance and makes you believe that you're really watching something who finds everything around them cracking. Leigh is good in her part, although there's no doubt that she's mainly used here for her sexuality. As far as Heston goes, yes, it wasn't too smart for him to be playing a Mexican but I've always thought his performance was fine. I liked the laid back, more mature performance and it honestly strikes me as a Charlie Chan type of character. A foreigner having to stand back to the American's while out smarting them. Then you've got Marlene Dietrich giving another remarkable performance.On a technical level TOUCH OF EVIL is virtually flawless. The music score, how it's used and the cinematography just perfectly capture the darkness of the story and there's no doubt that Welles sets a certain mood and atmosphere that's hard to match. The film's story is one that easily draws you in and makes you keep guessing right up to the very end. TOUCH OF EVIL is certainly the work of a genius.

Grabbing someone's ass while dancing is foreplay not art. The popularity of this film is a complete mystery to me. There is a reason why Jennifer Grey only had one other lead role in the virtually unknown WIND. Her voice is like fingernails on a chalkboard; when she raises her voice, which she does often, it sounds like cats being strangled. She ruined every scene she was seen in FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF. The film features some legendary cringe moments; how about the one that made all 500 people in the Eastgate die laughing? When Patrick, where are my muscles, Swayze leaps from the dais and begins what can only be described as hen jutting of his face back and forth I, and several other people, fell out of our seats onto the floor. Cut, Patrick, no more of that hen movement with the head sonny. The main problem with this unfunny, boring, badly acted piece of crap is the reverse working class snobbery. All the rich people, including Baby's father, are complete pompous asses. Of course, the workers are all saintly angels who are victimized by the evil rich owner and his arrogant, snotty, wimpy son. Yes, Penny gets pregnant but it is not her fault; the evil waiter Robbie who aspires to be rich and he even reads, brace yourself, ANN RYND. Oh, my God what a bastard!! Yes, baby is our bad acting, half ass missionary bringing the light to those saintly dumb asses who need her guidance. She is one of the Peace Corps for trashy dancing dummies. Please, OK we just ate; villains come in all classes for those watching too much of this crap. I happen to agree with gunnery Sgt. Hartman in FULL METAL JACKET; here you are all equally worthless. The cast is a who is who of bad actors. The stunning star of one of the biggest bombs in cinema STAYING ALIVE plays the poor, helpless Penny. It is so slow and boring; it drags on and on, one tired cliché after another. One hit song, hungry eyes, does not a soundtrack make; please want to know how bad the score is? When Patrick Swayze sings head for the exits rapidly. We have to listen to Jennifer shriek, whine and generally bitch the entire movie until I considered whether I could bludgeon myself with my red vines.

It's kind of a letdown when a movie begins by redefining the nature of reality, and ends with a shoot-out. We want a leap of the imagination, not one of those obligatory climaxes with automatic weapons fire.I've seen dozens if not hundreds of these exercises in violence, which recycle the same tired ideas Bad guys fire thousands of rounds, but are unable to hit the good guy. Then it's down to the final showdown between good and evil--a martial arts battle in which the good guy gets pounded until he's almost dead, before he finds the inner will to fight back. Been there, seen that (although rarely done this well).Too bad, because the set-up is intriguing. The Matrix recycles the premises of Dark City and Strange Days, turns up the heat and the volume, and borrows the gravity-defying choreography of Hong Kong action movies. It's fun, but it could have been more. The directors are Larry and Andy Wachowski, who know how to make movies (their first film, Bound, made my 10 best list in 1996). Here, with a big budget and veteran action producer Joel Silver, they've played it safer; there's nothing wrong with going for the Friday night action market, but you can aim higher and still do business.Warning; spoilers ahead. The plot involves Neo (Keanu Reeves), a mild-mannered software author by day, a feared hacker by night. He's recruited by a cell of cyber-rebels, led by the profound Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and the leather-clad warrior Trinity (Carrie- Anne Moss). They've made a fundamental discovery about the world It doesn't exist. It's actually a form of Virtual Reality, designed to lull us into lives of blind obedience to the system. We obediently go to our crummy jobs every day, little realizing, as Morpheus tells Neo, that Matrix is the wool that has been pulled over your eyes-- that you are a slave. The rebels want to crack the framework that holds the Matrix in place, and free mankind. Morpheus believes Neo is the Messianic One who can lead this rebellion, which requires mind power as much as physical strength. Arrayed against them are the Agents, who look like Blues Brothers. The movie's battles take place in Virtual Reality; the heroes' minds are plugged into the combat. (You can still get killed, though The body cannot live without the mind). Jacking in like this was a concept in Strange Days and has also been suggested in novels by William Gibson (Idoru) and others. The notion that the world is an artificial construction, designed by outsiders to deceive and use humans, is straight out of Dark City. Both of those movies, however, explored their implications as the best science fiction often does. Dark City was fascinated by the Strangers who had a poignant dilemma They were dying aliens who hoped to learn from human methods of adaptation and survival.In Matrix, on the other hand, there aren't flesh-and-blood creatures behind the illusion--only a computer program that can think, and learn. The Agents function primarily as opponents in a high-stakes computer game. The movie offers no clear explanation of why the Matrix-making program went to all that trouble. Of course, for a program, running is its own reward--but an intelligent program might bring terrifying logic to its decisions.Both Dark City and Strange Days offered intriguing motivations for villainy. Matrix is more like a superhero comic book in which the fate of the world comes down to a titanic fist-fight between the designated representatives of good and evil. It's cruel, really, to put tantalizing ideas on the table and then ask the audience to be satisfied with a shoot-out and a martial arts duel. Let's assume Neo wins. What happens then to the billions who have just been unplugged from the Matrix? Do they still have jobs? Homes? Identities? All we get is an enigmatic voice-over exhortation at the movie's end. The paradox is that the Matrix world apparently resembles in every respect the pre-Matrix world. (I am reminded of the animated kid's film Doug's 1st Movie, which has a VR experience in which everything is exactly like in real life, except more expensive.) Still, I must not ignore the movie's virtues. It's great-looking, both in its design and in the kinetic energy that powers it. It uses flawlessly integrated special effects and animation to visualize regions of cyberspace. It creates fearsome creatures, including mechanical octopi. It morphs bodies with the abandon of Terminator II. It uses f\/x to allow Neo and Trinity to run horizontally on walls, and hang in the air long enough to deliver karate kicks. It has leaps through space, thrilling sequences involving fights on rooftops, helicopter rescues and battles over mind control.And it has performances that find the right notes. Keanu Reeves goes for the impassive Harrison Ford approach, acting as little as possible. I suppose that's the right idea. Laurence Fishburne finds a balance between action hero and Zen master. Carrie-Anne Moss, as Trinity, has a sensational title sequence, before the movie recalls that she's a woman and shuttles her into support mode. Hugo Weaving, as the chief Agent, uses a flat, menacing tone that reminded me of Tommy Lee Jones in passive-aggressive overdrive. There's a well- acted scene involving Gloria Foster as the Oracle, who like all Oracles is maddeningly enigmatic.The Matrix did not bore me. It interested me so much, indeed, that I wanted to be challenged even more. I wanted it to follow its material to audacious conclusions, to arrive not simply at victory, but at revelation. I wanted an ending that was transformational, like Dark City's, and not one that simply throws us a sensational action sequence. I wanted, in short, a Third Act.

This is a very entertaining, tense, non stop, well made film. Connery's O'Niel is a good piece of acting, very controlled and intimidating. I am not going into the High Noon comparisons that plagued this film in 1981. It has several pop out scares that caused eruptions of popcorn in my theater. When you have two great old pros like Peter Boyle and Sean Connery together with passable effects, a great script and a good supporting cast, you have one great movie. It features the best foot chase in a movie until Casino Royale in 2006, and that was 25 years later. Action movies depend upon their villains and you will love hating the corporate swine Sheppard played very well by Boyle. Frances Sternhagen's Dr. Lazarus provides the only humor in an otherwise very tense, bleak, violent thriller. She and Connery's scenes are among the best in the movie. Hyams made some bad movies End of Days and 2010 but this was easily his best work. The scripts anti corporate take was derivative of ALIEN but so what? It is tense, suspenseful and well acted. It has great action sequences inside and outside in space. One of the few films to show an audience what happens to a human body exposed to space's zero pressure. People who are fans of GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY should watch this to see how terrible that scene of tape boy in space really is. The film has two stars taken away for O Niel's wife and son who are just dreadful actors. Hyams seemed to sense this; he has them leave on the shuttle but, unfortunately, we have to endure some of the worst acting on their taped messages to him. It brings the movie to a screeching halt; I know it is supposed to provide emotional depth but their performances are just abysmal. Also, 34 years later, I can still not make out the blue laser light bar couples simulating sex very odd and unnecessary. Lots of people under 40 may have missed this film, it did not do that well at the box office mainly due to the gore which today is quite tame.If you like Sean Connery, you are in for a real treat. Sternhagen, the only reason to watch Doc Hollywood, steals the film as the world's grumpiest doctor. It is very intense action packed and scary.

I'd be announcing myself as the killer. I'm not stupid, mystery novel writer Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) purrs to a room full of doubtful detectives. Being investigated is the murder of Johnny Boz, a rock 'n' roll star slashed to death during a round of cocaine-fueled, sadomasochistic sex. Basic Instinct opens graphically with his demise, a voluptuous blonde the killer. Tramell, his girlfriend, is, as it so happens, voluptuous and blonde. Coincidence? I wasn't dating him &#x97; I was f*cking him, she elaborates to the police. She didn't care enough about the victim to commit a heinous act; why waste her time jeopardizing her well-being on a wealthy lay? Clever as Tramell is, though, we aren't so sure of her innocence. So Basic Instinct spends the rest of its duration toying with us, unsure whether to label her as another red herring in the whodunit puzzle or a murderer waiting to be verified.Basic Instinct caused quite a stir back in 1992, fought against by gay activists for its evil depiction of lesbians and bisexuals and threatened by the MPAA for its explicit scenes of sex and violence. The non-stop controversy only lead to box-office domination &#x97; audiences were dying to see what all the fuss was about &#x97; and viewing the film nearly 25 years later is a guilty pleasure, a treat in the erotic thriller genre. Everyone will find something to be offended by here, but taking Basic Instinct's unsubtle portrayals of the sex and death 101 trope seriously is a mistake. On display is a stylish, sometimes deliriously entertaining modern day film noir, ready to titillate, manipulate.Michael Douglas portrays Nick Curran, a troubled cop heading the investigation of the above mentioned murder of Johnny Boz. Though Catherine Tramell, a brilliant, sexually wily psychopath, is the leading suspect, Curran immediately finds himself obsessed with her, despite knowing that she might be an ice-pick killer. The two embark on a torrid, often dangerous, affair &#x97; and as things heat up, murders reminiscent of Boz's death begin to pile up.With his split-screen techniques and emphasis on slow-motion and close-ups, one can only imagine what Brian De Palma could do with material like this. But Paul Verhoeven, a master of seedy storytelling, makes Basic Instinct so deliberately (and masterfully) noiry that merely focusing on that moment in which Stone may or may not have exposed her vulva (I'll get to that later) is a travesty. Most modern audiences remember the film for its soft-core sex scenes and slightly giallo slashings, but some critics, me included, hold Basic Instinct in high regard for its exquisite style.Sure, the sex is provocative and the violence is thrillingly over-the-top, but those who view Basic Instinct as a shameless would-be porno are missing the point. I can't say that the film is so smart that it would avoid covering the camera with Vaseline to highlight its inherent steaminess, yet Verhoeven's meticulous neo-noir flickerings make the film distinctly unforgettable instead of laughably arousing.Famous film noir trademarks include the decoration of rooms by the shadows of Venetian blinds and rising cigarette smoke, and not a scene in Basic Instinct goes by without masking itself with at least one of the two. Every inch of the police station is nicotine-laced and hazy, and Tramell looks lost when she isn't curling a Lucky Strike in her manicured fingers. If one were to consider what a 1950s era film noir would look like without the censors, without the black-and-white shimmer, Basic Instinct might be the answer. Yes, the film can be trashy, but it's too precisely designed to shrug off as trashy trash. It's divine trash, on the spectrum of carnally subdued art with its coffee-stained cinematography, its sweeping score.Even the infamous interrogation sequence, a staple in those most-paused movie moment slide shows that adorn spam websites, is a truly fantastic scene. Take away that nanosecond in which Sharon Stone uncrosses her legs and deftly reveals a nude nether region, and you get a superiorly shot sequence of filmmaking, an unforgettable moment in '90s cinema. The room is almost metallic in its placidity, the detectives as nervous as they are curt, the central Tramell a femme fatale goddess with her white minidress, white jacket, white cigarette, white pumps. The scene is fraught with sexual tension, a superior Stone cooing slick jabs (What are you gonna do, arrest me for smoking?) at a handful of men sweating their libidos off. Though lasting just a few minutes, the entire sequence is absolutely stunning in its hush-hush game of sensual cat-and-mouse.Douglas' portrayal is perhaps too unlikable for someone who is supposed to be the hero (he's much too prone to yelling, insulting, having existential crises to actually enjoy being around), but Stone is the only actor that matters &#x97; in the process, she steals the film and creates one of the most unforgettable female characters in noir history. Basic Instinct is sleazy, all right &#x97; but it isn't the tactless blockbuster you may remember it as. It has flashes of brilliance and flashes of unpleasantness and brutality &#x97; never, though, will you find yourself watching the clock.

For people who have never watched Sergio Leone watch his visuals. He uses his camera not dialogue; even at the very beginning watch how he directs. The bounty killers arrive like in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, the camera zooms in on their faces, one shows fear, another anger the last indifference. The physical environment is always hostile. Here, the wind blows everything around them all around. Very much like the author Steven Crane or other naturalists like Frank Norris. The environment is used as a mirror to you of the nature of human interaction within this universe HOSTILE. They slowly walk, earning money the hard way, to confront the Ugly. If you want to see a one of a kind, completely different way of telling a story, with music and visuals, not prattling talking, watch Sergio Leone. See the difference between our over the top way of depicting evil and Leone's. Does Angel Eyes ride up and shoot everyone right away? No, he needs information, when he approaches the music changes to a sinister theme, his approach is visually majestic; there is something ominous about the approaching man. That wicked smile and laugh, oh nice family, you know, when I been paid I always see the job through. More is not better; the understated cold laugh, the joy of hurting others, his ruthlessness, that is evil my friends. How is you digestion now? Yet, look how terrifying he is. You never know what he is going to do next. If only today's filmmakers could learn that throwing gore about the screen is so boring. Evil is a coldness; an utter indifference to others you do not need to go beyond the core.Some critics say; what makes him the good? He kills just as much through the picture. Just two scenes establish him as the good. My favorite, they walk by a blown apart house, Tuco sees the dying man and scowls at Blondie for wasting time. Blondie covers him with his coat and gives him a cigar; just a tiny gesture, but the eyes look up at him with astonished gratefulness. So shines a good deed in a weary world. His soul escapes like the smoke from the cigar; another masterful scene. This is why he was the greatest director who ever lived. See how understated it all is with no dialogue. Yet, with the music and the visuals look at its power. Such a tiny thing, yet that is why he is good. The other scene where Tuco and Pablo came to blows and Tuco is bragging how his priest brother adores him after they came to blows, Blondie sees he is suffering and offers him a cigar. This was Sergio Leone.My favorite scene is not the duel which though well done was surpassed in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, no Tuco running over the dead in a greed filled fury; this is the greatest scene of the film. What a depiction, by the socialist Leone, of the utter insanity of human greed and they truly do run over the dead, make no mistake about it. It starts so slow as he searches for the name Arch Stanton. It builds musically, in tempo, as the greed consumes him until he almost runs himself to death; what lust for money will do to human beings, Leone is showing us with the best simile for the total psychosis that is human greed. How all consuming; how oblivious to everyone and anything else. Watch the film for this scene. Yes, I like the duel; this scene has much more philosophical depth to it.In truth, everyone of his films is a real great piece of work, even the weakest FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE. His style is so unique; what a joy to be free of all that chatter; the beautiful music blended seamlessly with his visuals. Watch it and wish like me he had lived longer.

It builds musically, in tempo, as the greed consumes him until he almost runs himself to death; what lust for money will do to human beings, Leone is showing us with the best simile for the total psychosis that is human greed. How all consuming; how oblivious to everyone and anything else. Watch the film for this scene. Yes, I like the duel; this scene has much more philosophical depth to it.In truth, everyone of his films is a real great piece of work, even the weakest FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE. His style is so unique; what a joy to be free of all that chatter; the beautiful music blended seamlessly with his visuals. Watch it and wish like me he had lived longer.

For people who have never watched Sergio Leone watch his visuals. He uses his camera not dialogue; even at the very beginning watch how he directs. The bounty killers arrive like in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, the camera zooms in on their faces, one shows fear, another anger the last indifference. The physical environment is always hostile. Here, the wind blows everything around them all around. Very much like the author Steven Crane or other naturalists like Frank Norris. The environment is used as a mirror to you of the nature of human interaction within this universe HOSTILE. They slowly walk, earning money the hard way, to confront the Ugly. If you want to see a one of a kind, completely different way of telling a story, with music and visuals, not prattling talking, watch Sergio Leone. See the difference between our over the top way of depicting evil and Leone's. Does Angel Eyes ride up and shoot everyone right away? No, he needs information, when he approaches the music changes to a sinister theme, his approach is visually majestic; there is something ominous about the approaching man. That wicked smile and laugh, oh nice family, you know, when I been paid I always see the job through. More is not better; the understated cold laugh, the joy of hurting others, his ruthlessness, that is evil my friends. How is you digestion now? Yet, look how terrifying he is. You never know what he is going to do next. If only today's filmmakers could learn that throwing gore about the screen is so boring. Evil is a coldness; an utter indifference to others you do not need to go beyond the core.Some critics say; what makes him the good? He kills just as much through the picture. Just two scenes establish him as the good. My favorite, they walk by a blown apart house, Tuco sees the dying man and scowls at Blondie for wasting time. Blondie covers him with his coat and gives him a cigar; just a tiny gesture, but the eyes look up at him with astonished gratefulness. So shines a good deed in a weary world. His soul escapes like the smoke from the cigar; another masterful scene. This is why he was the greatest director who ever lived. See how understated it all is with no dialogue. Yet, with the music and the visuals look at its power. Such a tiny thing, yet that is why he is good. The other scene where Tuco and Pablo came to blows and Tuco is bragging how his priest brother adores him after they came to blows, Blondie sees he is suffering and offers him a cigar. This was Sergio Leone.My favorite scene is not the duel which though well done was surpassed in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, no Tuco running over the dead in a greed filled fury; this is the greatest scene of the film.
