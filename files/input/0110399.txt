[{"Title":"If you take this seriously then you're totally missing the point!","Date":"24 February 2006","Score":"13 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" A Low Down Dirty Shame is really no more than all the most familiar Cop movie clichés arranged in an order that makes a barely cohesive story. But it's all the fun and silly action that occurs in between that really matters! It's a bit like The Last Boy Scout from a spoof-blaxploitation angle.Shame (Keenan Ivory Wayans) is a former cop who has been blackballed after a major drugs bust went awry, leaving several DEA agents dead. He now works as a private detective, taking on suicide missions for peanuts and barely scraping by. His disapproving secretary Peaches (a very funny and very, very small Jada Pinkett) wants him to get his act together but he's too busy wallowing in self-pity.His old pal from the DEA shows up and offers him a side mission to help get back at the Drug Kingpin who ruined his career. And so, with only a few clues, Shame begins his search and soon all roads lead to lies and deception. Like I said, the plot is certainly nothing special. But it does contain a helluva lot of laughs and decent action.The one thing I can complain of is that the production design is kind of dated now. Action films have evolved so much in the past decade that watching ALDDS 12 years on can be a bit distracting. Wayans (who also directs as well as writing and starring) too often shoots non-actions scenes like a sitcom and his light-hearted editing may help remind you that this totally AIN'T a serious film but it's a little TV-ish if you know what I mean.If you find ALDDS for cheap somewhere or if it's showing on TV then don't con yourself out of a fun movie. High art is not what this film aims to be.

Samuel Jackson's Shaft is Shame without humor.Unfortunately, the humor is absolutely essential to this story. For one thing, it creates a black identity that is capable of rising above any Hollywood appropriation of it. Shame's secretary - and real romantic interest - is a strong black woman - a character type that Hollywood has finally admitted actually exists only very recently, since about 2001.So Samuel Jackson's Shaft gets a x-million dollars promo, and still can't come up with an interesting story (although it was nice to see Richard roundtree on the screen again).Meanwhile, let's talk about entertainment - alright, there are some bits that don't work; but enough do to keep the film moving. I had good time; what the heck.

But somehow Shame went under my radar.Straight up, it wasn't as good as I'm Gonna Git You Sucka, which is pure comedy gold. But it was definitely a perfect movie to watch after coming home from work and just wanting something that doesn't involve a lot of thinking but still fun to watch.Everything about this movie is pretty mediocre the action lacks explosions, the gun play is a little tame, and the bad guy isn't very bad. What saves this movie is Keenen's charisma. The dude is really funny and can carry flimsy plot all the way to the end. It felt as if he were missing an equally strong partner, such as Lethal Weapon's set up, but Jada sorta fills that role with her strong personality.

There are three words that describe this movie FUNNY AS HELL! Keenan Ivory Wayans was good in the title role, but Jada Pinkett and Charles S. Dutton were the two best things in the movie. Andrew Divoff was good as the villian and Salli Richardson was good as the damsel/villian in the movie. This movie will have you cracking up with laughter. But don't watch it on regular television, it won't do you justice.    I saw from other reviews that people were complaining about the absurdity of the action. Well, it's an action-comedy. It's suppose to absurd. Besides, most movies that are in the action category are absurd anyway.   On the other hand, this movie shows off the superb acting skills of Jada Pinkett, which Hollywood has just notice. In almost every scene that Keenan and Jada are in together, Jada usually outshines him. In addition, Salli Richarson is another black actress Hollywood seems to be ignoring. In her role, Richardson is sensual, dangerous, and cunning (If anyone wants to see more of Richardson, she's currently starring in the show Family Law, on CBS). Charles S. Dutton overacts at times, but it adds to comedy part of the movie.   MIGHT BE A SPOILER This movie has a decent fight scene between the two female leads. Personally, it could have been longer.

That's pretty hard to imagine in a movie full of bloody violence and `trash talk,' but it is the same kind of good naturedness that made Keenan Ivory Wayan's other work so likeable `I'm Gonna Get Ya, Sucka, In Living Color'. I've never thought much of Wayans as an actor, but he has a gift few actors possess, i.e., the uncanny ability NOT to take himself seriously. He's relaxed and funny, even when much of what occurs around him is not. Wayan's the producer, on the other hand, can be quite edgy, and his work milks a lot of humor from negative stereotypes, particularly of his own race. It should be no secret that Wayans' work has a big following among white southerners, for reasons likely quite different than those of his black audience.The action set pieces in `. . . Shame' are as impressive as anything in a Bruce Willis movie. That's saying a lot. Other than Wayans, the actors in `. . . Shame' play everything pretty broadly. Charles Dutton comes off the worst, a disappointment considering his impressive work in `Alien 3' and the TV series `Roc'. Salli Richardson, besides being luscious  (a light-skinned Pam Grier, without the big tits) does a serviceable job. However, I could have done without `motormouth' Jada Pinkett. You guys who find her attractive in this movie get what you deserve. POSSIBLE SPOILER  The `twist' when Wayans suddenly becomes `supercool' seriously undermines the credibility of the movie. His firepower alone would equal a cop's annual salary. Throw in that wardrobe and car and one wonders whether Wayans was on the take, after all. However, this `twist' convinces me Wayans should have played John Shaft in the remake. NOTE TO PRODUCER WAYANS  YOU'RE NOT TOO OLD TO DO IT NOW! If the primary purpose of movies is to entertain, `A Low Down Dirty Shame' succeeds. You want plausibility? Look elsewhere.

All of this inspiration from Shaft comes in A Low Down Dirty Shame. Like Shaft, Low Down has a cop or ex-cop, as well as action-packed sequences, like gunfights and fist fights, and this modernization from the former flick made A Low Down Dirty Shame make its positive impact.But there are a few twists. Keanon Ivory Wayans plays the role of Shame, who is actually an investigator who has ties to the DEA and retired as a cop. And instead of the common .38 revolver, his favorite service weapon is the 9mm Beretta. He has his sidekick, a friend named Peaches (played by Jada Pinkett at that time before she became Jada Pinkett-Smith). Shame runs his own private investigation business.So, as the story unfolds, a DEA mole named Sonny invites Shame to take on a mission to capture Ernesto Mendoza, a Mexican narcotrafficker who had a strong romance interest with character Angela Flowers, who was attempting to try to beckon Mendoza to turn himself in.The start of this focused on Shame's remembrances with Angela in the past. He mentions that she wears Covenant perfume, and basically goes on the mend to find her exactly. He does find her in one of the apartments with a bit of a police trick, and calls Sonny to try to get her to turn Mendoza in to the authorities, but regrettably, Angela said that she was on the run because a potential hit by a drug gang is imminent. This is when Sonny drops the ball but not at her...Angela was tipped, and Shame knows this. They escape the apartment as the drug gang comes in to try the death wish attempt...they confront the armed gang, and was able to escape with their lives.At Ernesto Mendoza's compound, the gang comes back home along with Sonny, and Ernesto gets upset. Sonny then rails at Ernesto that what he did will put Ernesto in trouble...and Shame was the main fly in the ointment for all of the trouble. Ernesto then does a knife slash on one of the gang members--the one who messed up the hit on Shame and Angela, and orders Sonny to get Shame.Then, Shame arms himself to the death to try to reverse the tide. He starts by forcing a low-level member of Ernesto's drug gang, Luis, to tell where Mendoza is. Little did Luis did not know that he ran into a White Supremacist rally to find that out. With that psychological torture, Luis was able to tell Shame where he was--at a nightclub. And he does. He likes to do tricks to get what he wants.Another scene I liked was the confrontation between Sonny and Angela at the shopping mall. Sonny had his gun drawn at him after Angela found the drug money. She is forced to step away and Sonny realizes that the money was real. Then, taking out of a page from the James Bond movies, Angela undresses her top, and reveals a full-figured black bra. But Sonny was smart, deciding not to take Angela's trick, but despite that, another ugly surprise..Angela then displays a gun from her back but Sonny did not even realize it...he gets hit several times as Sonny was about to use his gun to fire him back. Then a coup-de-grace shot by her finishes him off. So she killed Sonny so she can get the money.The final fight between Mendoza and Shame was something. Shame finally brings Mendoza down after a fight that resembled a dirty street fight and Muay Thai martial arts....and arrests him but the loud bang from a bullet kills Mendoza...but it was Angela who did it, not Shame. Now, she is going to kill Shame but from behind, Peaches, with her karate skills, was able to finish off Angela before Angela could kill off Shame.Then, you hear Peaches' love for soap operas as the movie is about to approach the final credits. So basically, when I flash back, Peaches loves television so much--that's the reason why she loves soap operas.

I don't know how the 1994's Razzie of the worst picture went to (Color of Night) ?! In comparison with (A Low Down..), (Color of Night) is a classic masterpiece !! It's violent comic action without any comedy or action. And its only violence is in its mammoth silliness of each and every factor in it; the cast, the way they act, the dialog, the characters, the situations...etc. (Keenen Ivory Wayans) isn't remotely funny at all; his comic scenes seemed horrible. He didn't impress anybody in his action scenes too. (Keenen Ivory Wayans)'s plot got nothing to be remembered after watching (or during watching !). And (Keenen Ivory Wayans)'s directing wasn't less low ! Did I forget to tell you that Mr. Wayans starred, wrote, and directed the whole thing? It isn't related to the fact that he's a cinematic genius or something, it's maybe because no decent moviemaker could bear working with him !I'm a fan of (Charles S. Dutton); however I hated seeing him in here. (Jada Pinkett Smith) was incredibly unsightly and stupidly annoying. True (Salli Richardson-Whitfield) was kind of sexy, but not preferentially, or for long, or in a way could compensate for the endless ugly matters that this movie is crowded with ! The climax of its torturing crap is the lead's too gay sidekick Wayman (or women ?!). He can't do anything, even making laughs as he's supposed to. The only thing he succeeded to do is forcing you to throw up continually. The black try of making fun of black stereotypes wasn't filthier before!It's one naked movie, which has nothing &#x96; and I mean NOTHING &#x96; entertaining or else to present. Definitely the worst Blaxploitation movie is more interesting and memorable than this. However (A Low Down Dirty Shame) is a movie that my stomach won't forget.

Did I hate it? Well, it makes itself impossible to love. I hated the scene of seeing the great lead preparing to fight, wearing the best of what he has of clothes and weapons; I have seen this moment for at least 1000 times before! I hated (Jada Pinkett Smith) as the secretary. I may go to hell if I ever put beautiful and her name in one sentence anytime! The way she looks and talks is extremely sickening. What epithet she deserves the most ? The most detestable cartoon character, the silliest girl even been in an action, or the ugliest thing I have ever seen !Having none sense of humor was better than having the worst kind; as this movie does ! From totally unfunny scenes for (Wayans), to such a contumely to the 1960s star (James Brown) as if only dogs that listen to his songs now, ending up with the hellish dialog. Most of the time I felt my ears getting flayed. Just recall  the numerous ass, penis, fucking terminologies. I believe this movie is a fine reference book for all the squalid phrases that use these words (the tabloid speaks about decreasing the size of asses, shoot my ass, don't make me spank your black ass, promise me to burn his ass...) Ahh, there is no end and nothing else. It assures not only that (Wayans) knows nothing about writing comedy but by using these terms, he rather knows nothing from the English language but them too! Let alone the free pure filth The conversation about the beauty of a crippled girl's butt, or the joy of making love with the crippled girls in general (!!!!!). Or the awful story of (Jada Pinkett Smith) about her dog that shits a lot. Things like these, and I'm not sorry to say, made the movie as a huge pile of excrement itself !But still, to add more vomit, here you are; the lead's sissy sidekick Wayman. 3 scenes, just 3, got this thing in it. Nevertheless the repugnant effect of it can't be forgotten. What alien from outer space, or a demon from inferno, can actually bear this Wayman for a second ??

Basically Low-Down-Dirty Shame is a boring clichéd movie that is just full of black jive. This is a movie where the cool black dude is not just stereotypical, but everywhere. Not only is Shame (Keenan Ivory Wayans) a cool black guy, but so is his secretary Peaches. What really annoyed me is that at the end those two got together and basically it was a relationship that just didn't seem right. When I create relationships, there is just something about them that make them seem right (not that they will work, rather just seem realistic).Low Down Dirty Shame is about an ex-cop who has become a private detective but his work is a little slow and he has a habit of losing his pay because he causes too much damage. The down and out detective is just too clichéd to be believable. Yet even though he is almost bankrupt, somehow he still has a cool car, heaps of guns, and a nice suit. Seriously this movie is just stretches the imagination too far. The plot is also too clichéd. He is after a Mexican drug-lord which seems to be the focus of every pointless cop movie these days. The twist is that this drug-lord is supposed to be dead, killed by Shame a few years earlier. Not only is this clichéd but the annoying Lieutenant is just as bad because he keeps on telling Shame off for just being there. He even tries to arrest Shame but Shame is just way too cool for that.

He takes the case for personal as much as financial reasons and soon finds himself in a whole world of trouble. Meanwhile his secretary Peaches, tries to help him but the sexual tension between them also proves to be a distraction.I must admit that I expected very little from this film and, truth be told, it delivered exactly what I expected from it &#150; very little. From the title I knew it was aiming to be a comedy that would homage the idea of Shaft and other such movies &#150; I didn't think that it would aim for spoof because it appeared to be more affectionate than that. This in itself is not a terrible thing but unfortunately it doesn't do anything very well and only succeeds in being a very basic piece of entertainment. The dramatic plot is important to it since it does try to be a thriller of sorts; sadly it doesn't work as it has too little substance and too much in the way of lazy writing and sweeping dramatic clichés.These clichés are also to be found in the characters. Shame is totally by-the-numbers; Peaches is a typically sassy black woman cliché; there is a tough police sergeant etc etc. Wayans is OK and fits the title role but, aside from some nice lines he really doesn't make the role his own. Pinkett is sexy and all but really she is yet another person reinforcing the neck-jerking, finger-clicking cliché of black women that is forced fed to us in too many media outlets. Dutton has little to do and Divoff is a pretty obvious bad guy. The cast all try but to be honest the material just isn't there dramatically or for the comedy and there is little the cast can do to cover for that &#150; however it is hard to defend a performance from Hawkins that verges on being offensive.Overall this is very basic distraction that may just about do you if you are in an undemanding mood for a vaguely amusing but derivative detective movie. The script, plot and characters are overwhelmed by cliché and nothing actually works that well at all. Basic, Friday night stuff but certainly not worth staying in for.

Unfortunately, the whole movie is done completely by formula; the comic sidekick, the traitorous agent, the villain who doesn't have a single likable quality. Why is it that every single bad guy in 90's action-thrillers have to be a drug-lord? Seriously, it's getting old. Furthermore, all the 'comedy' consists of racial and sexual stereotypes. Have the Wayans' brothers actually made something that was good? I've never seen anything worthwhile from them. The plot is a simple rehash of hundreds of other action movies. The acting is mediocre, at best. The characters are mostly one-dimensional. The action is OK, but nothing you haven't already seen in hundreds of action movies before this one. I feel sorry for Jada Pinkett, having to play such a stereotypical character; she deserves better. Nearly any actor/actress does. I'd only recommend this to actual fans of the Wayans' brothers, as most others will just cringe at the utter lack of originality. 5/10 "},{"Title":"A real stinker!","Date":"4 January 2000","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Keenen Ivory Wayans is pretty successful when he's spoofing the urban crime/action flicks, but when he's playing it more seriously, that's another story. This movie is awful from beginning to end. It's a sorry retread of every other movie of this genre you've seen plus Wayans' humor fails him as well. If you enjoyed his sniggering portrayal of homosexuals on 'In Living Colour' you'll be pleased to see more of the same here. Of course, just about everyone in this film is a stereotype or caricature as well. Some of the actors, like Charles S. Dutton, almost rise above the muck, but it's impossible to look too good with this material. I felt sorry for Jada Pinkett, stuck in an especially dumb role. In my opinion, 'A Low Down Dirty Shame' is particularly well-named.  "}]
