[{"Title":"Cusack and Beckinsale Make It Work","Date":"8 October 2001","Score":"94 out of 105 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  	Magic happens, if you let it; and sometimes even fate or destiny-- or whatever you want to call it-- steps in to lend a hand.  But when it concerns love, and finding that special person you're going to spend the rest of your life with, should you risk tempting fate with a test of that love or what is seemingly meant to be, or should you just follow your apparent destiny and embrace it?  Such are the questions two people must face and answer in the romantic comedy/drama `Serendipity,' directed by Peter Chelsom.  Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) is shopping for a gift for his girlfriend, and Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) is looking for something for her boyfriend when they reach for the same pair of gloves on a rack at Bloomingdales.  And the wheels of fate are quickly turning.  Or are they?  Jonathan and Sara proceed to spend the next few hours together, including a romantic interlude skating in New York's Central Park, and there are definite sparks flying between them.  For Jonathan, it's a significant emotional experience, and he realizes something has happened, that something has changed in his life; Sara feels the same, but being a true believer in destiny, she needs a sign that this is meant to be before she'll consider pursuing whatever it is that's just happened between them.  So she puts it to the test.  And for Jonathan, knowing only that her name is Sara, it's the beginning of an odyssey-- a quest-- to find true love with the woman he already knows in his heart of hearts that he wants to share his life with.  For Sara, it's the beginning of a search for love, and for that one special person she knows is destined to be her soul mate forever.  They both find, however, that the path to pure love is filled with every obstacle the known universe could possibly place in their way.  And is the journey worth it?  Well, in the end, it all comes down to what fate has predetermined.  Or does it?	In the tradition of such films as `Sleepless In Seattle' and `You've Got Mail,' Chelsom has fashioned a truly romantic tale of two people who are absolutely destined to be together, no matter what.  And-- as the audience knows early on-- nothing less will be acceptable.  Hanks and Ryan may be missing, but the charismatic Cusack and the beguiling Beckinsale more than make up for it, carving out their own niche in the genre with this outing, and Chelsom has just enough of that Nora Ephron touch (including the use of music, matching the perfect song with every situation) to make it work.  The chances of things ever happening in real life the way they do in this movie are about twice as remote as winning the lottery, but who cares?  This is a heartwarming fable about love-- about the way we `want' love to be-- and it's delivered with an endearing care that makes it emotionally involving, entertaining and a thoroughly satisfying experience.  And there's not a whole lot more you can ask of a movie, I think.	Cusack is so likable, and manages to convey the bedevilment of his situation with such facility, that the viewer is unequivocally drawn in from the beginning.  You want things to work out for this guy-- and Sara, as well; and, of course, you're pretty confident from the outset they are going to.  But along the way they make you feel something; they enable you to share the frustration as well as the elation that comes with discovering love, and perhaps finding that better part of yourself at the same time.  And the fact that Cusack makes Jonathan so believable, and someone with whom you can identify, has more than a lot to do with it.  It's a quality performance from an actor with the flexibility and range to do just about anything, and who never disappoints.	The other half of the equation for success, of course, belongs to Beckinsale, who is not only beautiful, but a good actor who infuses her character with a touch of mystery and complexity that makes her winsome and interesting.  Like Cusack's Jonathan, Sara is someone you can root for; you want to see her get what she wants and what she deserves.  This isn't a perfect world we live in, and we all know it; but for Sara and Jonathan you want it to be.  There's a chemistry between the two of them, and they make it so easy for you to project your own feelings and desires into their situation, that there's no getting around it.  If they win, you win.  It's that simple.  And even though they take you over some rough spots along the way, it's a fun trip and Beckinsale and Cusack-- Sara and Jonathan-- make it a journey worth taking.	The supporting cast includes Molly Shannon, Jeremy Piven, Bridget Moynahan and Eugene Levy (who is terrific-- and hilarious-- as a sales clerk at Bloomingdales).  A handsome film that touches all the right nerves and pushes all the right buttons, `Serendipity' has a gentle sensibility about it that addresses the notions of romance and love that reside within us all.  And it's refreshingly presented in a way that is pure and inoffensive; and as such it allows you to open up and embrace something of value without having to apologize for it, and without implying you have to be `hip' to appreciate it.  Because it's all about love and sharing love, which is something we can all use a little more of in this world we live in today.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.

Jonathan (John Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckinsale) meet in Bloomingdales when they both want to purchase the same pair of gloves.  The attraction is instant and they spend a romantic evening cavorting around New York City together.  At the end of the evening John wants to see her again, but Sara decides that if it is fate that they should be together, they will find each other again.  She drives away in a cab and he never sees her again.   Well, almost never.Years go by and both of them are about to be married, but each still has this nagging feeling that the other was his/her one true love.  Of course fate conspires to bring them back together (after about a dozen near misses) as they each simultaneously undertake one last attempt to find one another just before they get married to someone else.The fate angle is plowed mercilessly, almost to the point of nausea, but the skits are funny and the chemistry between Cusack and Beckinsale is enchanting.  Cusack is an expert at playing the tortured and neurotic lover, but here he is more haunted and forlorn than dysfunctional, and it plays much better than his previous two characters in `High Fidelity' and `America's Sweethearts'.  Kate Beckinsale rocketed from obscurity to prominence with her performance in `Pearl Harbor' and proves to be a wonderful romantic lead in this film.  She is breezy and adorable and spins a delightful web around Jonathan and the viewer.  The film also benefits from outstanding comedic support from Jeremy Piven as Jonathan's best friend and devoted Sara sleuth.  Piven's zany comedy proves to be the perfect complement to Cusack's wry despondency.  Eugene Levy is a scream as the eccentric Bloomingdales salesman, who blackmails Jonathan into buying half the store to give him information from Sara's charge account.All in all, this is an entertaining comedy that is insubstantial but delectable.  I tend to give romantic comedies a little more slack, because I'm a sucker for this slush, and this is one of the better ones I've seen in a while so I rated it a 9/10.  This lighthearted romp makes a great date flick, but if serious drama is your preference stay away.

In accordance with Webster' dictionary, it means 'an apparent aptitude for making accidental fortunate discoveries'. The character of Sara believes on it, but regrets for her belief in the end of the story. This is the typical predictable and commercial film, but supported by a very charming actress (Kate Beckinsale) and actor (John Cusack). I am a suspicious viewer to make any comment in this regard, since I love Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack. But I really believe there is no way that any viewer dislikes this movie.

Despite their obvious chemistry, Sara insists on leaving their future up to fate (she turns out to be a therapist, so you'd think she'd know better, but more on that momentarily), whereupon they get separated in the Waldorf=Astoria.  Years later, Sara and Jon are both engaged to other people, but can't stop thinking about one another, so they each take a last stab at finding each other again before their respective nuptials.  Knowing what a big John Cusack fan I am, a friend of mine recommended I rent SERENDIPITY. Between a parade of people phoning us and our own busy schedules, however, I had almost as much trouble getting to finally sit down and watch the DVD from start to finish as Jon and Sara did trying to get back together in the film itself!  But it was worth the effort  even though I was growling at Sara under my breath for being so stupid as to leave their budding romance up to fate instead of running off with Jon when she had the chance (and was Sara so new to NYC that it never occurred to her that other people might take Jon's elevator in the Waldorf=Astoria during their decisive elevator race?  Do fate and common sense have to be mutually exclusive?), I found Cusack and Beckinsale so endearing and so full of romantic chemistry (and they both looked yummy, I might add) that I found myself forgiving a lot and rooting for them to get back together.  Marc Klein's script is so chock-full of funny and frustrating near-misses that at times I found SERENDIPITY as suspenseful as a Hitchcock film! -)  NYC and San Francisco locations are used wonderfully (I was pleased to see that although the second floor of Serendipity III as shown in the film was quiet enough for Sara and Jon to hear each other talk, it was still as crowded as it usually is on a holiday week! -).  Cusack and Beckinsale are surrounded by a delightful supporting cast, too, particularly Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon as their respective best friends and the scene-stealing Eugene Levy as an officious, self-serving Bloomingdale's salesman.  I also found it refreshing that the filmmakers didn't take the obvious route of making the leads' current Significant Others so horrible that you can't imagine what attracted Our Heroes to these creeps in the first place (that sort of thing always makes me lose respect for both the protagonist *and* the screenwriter).  Bridget Moynihan and John Corbett (did the casting directors just stroll on over to the set of SEX AND THE CITY one day and say Who's free to make a movie? -) were appealing enough that I could understand what Cusack and Beckinsale saw in them, yet they were just self-absorbed enough and not-quite-on-our-heroes'-wavelength enough that I didn't feel bad when they got dumped. If romantic whimsy is your bag, give SERENDIPITY a try.

Jeremy Given gave a wonderful performance as Cusack's friend, which greatly helps the film work. And special mention must be made of a hilarious cameo role played by Eugene Levy as the salesman one most dreads meeting at Bloomingdales in New York. (His hysterical 'don't step behind the counter!' is what we have all encountered so often with neurotic sales people. Of course, one 'understands', while laughing uncontrollably at them.) This film is funny, warm, life-affirming, ironical, strange, disturbing, comforting, and licks your face like a puppy. Its theme is the invisible tapestry and connecting threads of fate which lie behind the events of the visible world, especially as they relate to True Love. In other words, 'serendipity', or fortunate chance. Cusack and Beckinsale find each other, are eternally meant for each other, lose each other, and - well, I don't want to spoil things, - but let us say, search for each other for years, with results to be discovered by the viewer. It is all so charming and just right that rather than find another romantic film, one might just as well watch this one again over and over, with a steadily increasing and delighted smile. Above all, it is Cusack who makes this, as he is the ideal romantic male lead for such charming and elfish fare. His slightly pixie-like looks are just quirky enough, not too much to make him look truly odd, but enough to mark him on the brow as 'an innocent at large' who can have these adventures and really mean them.

Of coarse, I might not love it as much if it didn't have such a great cast, including two charismatic and unforgettable romantic leads, played of coarse by Kate Beckinsell and John Cussack.Serendipty is one of those movie's that anyone who dislikes sappy, schmaltzy, romantic comedies will probably hate, but for those who like A smart romantic comedy, chock full of a bit of a fairy tale/fantasy edge, touched off by that (Love Actually, the holidays are almost here) kind of feeling, this is your movie.

The whole movie is dreamy, from it's look, to the engaging characters. It's not difficult to keep your eyes on the screen throughout.Serendipity's premise is a great idea for a movie and always stays engaging, never drifting off into silliness, even though many things happen that are unrealistic. It's great as a date movie, as one the whole family can enjoy, and to watch with a group of friends. My only minor criticism is the amount of time it takes these two to get together but the ending makes it worth it.Beckinsale and Cussack have a limited amount of time together on screen, with most of that time happening at the beginning of the film. But in that short amount of time they are able to display more believability and chemistry to the falling in love aspect then many on screen pairs who get triple the amount of screen time do.I give this between an 8.5 and 9 of 10.

This is a romance film about two individuals who, whilst both in perfectly-good-but-not-quite-perfect relationships with other people, take a fancy to a random stranger they meet in a department store one evening and so spend the rest of the night flirting outrageously like a cheap tart with them.This done, off they both go to continue their extant relationships. Unfortunately, instead of realising that they could do better and bringing the relationships to a neat end, they only decide to make a run for it on the eves of their coincident weddings. How serendipitous.We then have the pleasure of watching them each drag their best friends (one of whom's marriage is destroyed in the process) across the planet in order to try and find their once-potential philanderer, whilst their nice bride/groom stands rather forlornly alone at the altar. As any plot line following the jilted spouses is abandoned at this point, I am surmising that they were stood up. Perhaps they died. Who cares.Man finds girl, some snow falls, some kissing ensues and our happy couple realise that the forty-five minutes they spent together in a restaurant six months ago are more than enough to base their everlasting happiness on. Audience feel warm and fuzzy inside. Speaking for myself, I was certainlyclose to tears.The idea that this film could be billed as a romantic comedy is quite extraordinary. Certainly, the leading characters appear to share the moral outlook of a badger on heat and in that respect I'm very glad they managed to find a like-minded mate. Every other character featured in the film is quite laughably two-dimensional and the only deliberately comedic fragment I managed to spot was a quite nicely done best man's speech - made at the weddding subsequently destroyed by our lovably lust-fuelled hero and heroine.I am secretly hoping that the joke is on me, and Mr. Chelsom is treating us to a wonderfully dark satire on morals and romance in modern times.

Shown as a quite romantic place (where the story happened), NYC on Xmas really enchants with its atmosphere and Central park. The story and the accidents in the film may seem to be unrealistic or too perfect for someone, Serendipty however is kind of a touching and charming movie anyway. You just have to cut notions like destiny', fate out of your mind because this is no more than the scenery for a movie about a love story and love in its romantic sense. The duet Cusack-Beckinsale looked very charming and naturally, even when their characters were acting in a some weird (and stupid in some sense) way. Eugene Levy and Jeremy Piven also injected the best comedic elements in the final mix. One of the movies' great merits is about heart-to-heart moments between characters, shown very gently and softly. Because of this merit the movie doesn't seem to be glossy or sugary. Serendipity doesn't pretend to be a multi-layered film with kinda new ideas (neither do most romantic films I reckon) but it fulfills the key purpose of giving the audience warmth and a bit of hope.

Likewise, an implausible premise requires abundant fictions to keep the story going--often into even more absurd realms. The premise of Serendipity is that it is not you who determines your own destiny; rather it is fate that makes the determination as to how your life will play out. Consider Sara's retort to Jonathan just after they meet and he wants to get her name and phone numberJonathan I just had a really great time and for all we know I wouldn't be able to find you again.Sara Well, if we're meant to meet again, we'll meet again. It's just not the right time now. Now how does Sara know what the RIGHT time is? She doesn't, so she's going to let fate decide. How droll!The doctrine of fatalism is a flawed doctrine which states that all events are fixed in advance so that we are powerless to change them. People are merely pieces on a chessboard, manipulated by some supernatural power--all choice has been removed from the equation and we have no recourse but to submit ourselves to the will of some external agency. At one point in the movie, Sara's friend Courtney told her as much, and that was the closest we come to ANY truth in this movie. But the premise must be maintained at all costs, and so once the two main characters part, all kinds of fatalistic events occur as if on cue to help them find one another again--the five dollar bill with Jonathan's name on it, the book with Sara's phone number in it, etc. The list of improbabilities increases as the movie descends into utter ludicrousness.One particularly distasteful aspect of this movie was the shallowness of the lead characters. When Jonathan and Sara first met, they were both involved with other people. And those other people, we come to find out, are very nice people who are in love with our main characters. Well it seems to me that Jonathan and Sara can't be too happy with their respective relationships if they are flirting with one another! And if they had any misgivings, then it would have been honest of them both to let their significant others in on the secret instead of leading them on in such a disingenuous fashion--especially since those significant others were good and decent people who truly loved them. To string someone along to the point where you've convinced that person that you want to marry him or her, but to pine away for someone else and then end the relationship at the last moment is not only cowardly and dishonest&#x97;it is cruel. But why settle for second best when fate has decreed otherwise? Given the above, it was impossible for me to like Jonathan and Sara. All I felt was contempt for their willingness to submit to fate and to not take the responsibility for their actions into their own hands. If I had met a girl whom I thought could be the love of my life (and I sincerely doubt such a thing would happen during a brief interlude in a department store as it did in the movie!), you can bet your bottom dollar that I would NEVER, EVER leave anything up to chance! I would have asked that girl for her phone number and would not have left her without it. Unless of course she was a girl like Sara, in which case I probably would have had no choice but to let fate decide. After all, she did say it's just not the right time now. Sure babe. Sure.To cap off the succession of absurdities, there was no emotional payoff at the end of the movie. Jonathan and Sara shake hands when they finally meet followed by a weak and unconvincing kiss. You would think after two years of constantly thinking about one another and trying desperately to reconnect, that our lovers would have rushed into each other's arms and shouted for joy. But no! They simply stand next to each other on the ice rink looking cold and bemused. But then, considering the flawed script and all the fatalistic occurrences that permeate every inch of this ridiculous movie, I can only believe that it was fated to be this way.

There were problems with the story though, like how their respective significant others were handled in the story. Since this is a fantasy, the focus is on them both and only them both. It is far from being a great movie. Personally, I enjoyed it and the sweet moments were very nicely done.

Being a boy of ten at the time of the trailer's release, I did not say aloud my wish to see this movie. But I desperately wanted too.Due to circumstances beyond my control I have had to grow up slightly faster than other people my age.

How about destiny or the fact that everything happens for a reason, and there are no coincidences in life? In the romantic comedy Serendipity, it is a story of two New Yorkers, Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) and Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) who meet by fate in a Bloomingdale's department store over a pair of black cashmere gloves, and spend an odd yet nice night together, then leave it all to chance as they write their phone numbers on a five dollar bill and a used book. If the bill or book is found then they know that they were meant to be and that fate has brought them together. Years later, after neither have found each others phone numbers, the two are close to getting married to different people, basically on the same date. While both are having second thoughts about their current situation and can't get the other off their minds, try one more time to find each other. This hopeful romantic film is a great date movie and highly recommended. If you don't believe in fate now, you will once you have watched this movie.Serendipity means a fortunate accident. I personally think that everything happens for a reason and that there are no accidents or coincidences in life. So this movie was right up my ally. A little frustrating at first though to see a couple hit it off so well and then leave everything to chance, but if it was meant to be then it will happen, right? The two go through some pretty suspenseful twists and your left thinking if they're going to end up finding each other. The lengths that they both endure are so sweet you just want them to find each other and fall madly in love again.John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale have amazing on- screen chemistry, and when put together they make the perfect pair. John Cusack is a very witty guy in this film and is always there for a good laugh. His character, Jonathan Trager is your typical hopeless romantic that you end up rooting for in the end to find the girl and sweep her off her feet. He is a very talented actor and is nothing short of in this flick. His character is also paired with best friend Dean Kansky (Jeremy Piven), an obituary writer for the New York Times. Together these two are the dynamic duo. Jeremy Piven with his one-liners and comedic timing is a perfect side kick for the uneasy and confused Jonathan Trager. Both are in the race to find the girl of Jonathan's dream, running all around New York, pulled in a million directions, and fighting over obstacles in order to have one last chance with the one that got away, two days before his wedding. Opposite John Cusack, Kate Beckinsale is also an amazing actress to watch. She sparkles on screen with her beauty and grace, playing the perfect girl for Jonathan to chase. She too is linked with a best friend, Eve (Molly Shannon) who is by her side the whole time tearing through New York to try and find Jonathan. Molly Shannon's character owns a new-age store in San Francisco, and has just the quirky style and comedic support to balance out Kate Beckinsale. They are the perfect best bud match and are fun to watch interact with each other. With the wonderful setting of the beautiful New York and these four talented actors this movie was sure to attract all those hopeless romantics out there.Serendipity overall is a fantastic movie, with an interesting storyline, talented and well known actors all to a backdrop of the beautiful New York skyline. This is a great romantic comedy that will keep you in a pleasant suspense until the very end, and left wondering if there is a certain person out there that you are meant to spend the rest of your life with. Will you meet by fate, by chance; is it your long time best friend, or the person sitting next to you on the subway? This movie leaves you questioning your every move, and second guessing your life choices. Give fate and destiny a chance; you never know what they will bring to you.

I knew that this was a romantic type of movie which was totally different from her cold and fierce persona as Selene in Underworld but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Although I was reminded of Sleepless in Seattle through parts of the movie, it had enough differences to make it unique. They put just enough obstacles to make the movie interesting and not overly frustrating. I mean how many close calls can you have before finally running into each other again?

I don't think this movie was trying to be on the level of the Godfather or Citizen Cane. Why are people so critical these days. This was an incredibly sweet movie. John Cusack has been making movies like this (Better Off Dead, Sure Thing, Say Anything, and even Grosse Pointe Blank) for years. He has turned being the funny and likable everyman into an art form. This movie was certainly light and and fluffy but that was the point all along. This movie was supposed to remind us all of that special girl or boy that we met for maybe only a moment and yet still remember in exact detail years later everything about them. I think most men watching this film would think that way about Kate Beckinsale's character, she was absolutely adorable. Thank god we get to see a film with a beautiful woman who spends an hour and a half being lovely and a sweetheart instaed of the typical sex craved and materialistic cynics that we so often see. Kate Beckinsale's character was the exact opposite of Sex in the City's Sarah Jessica Parker. We've seen her bitch and whine and destroy herself relationship wise for several seasons now because she is sooo deeep, introspective, and cool yeah right. What a mess! Just lighten up gang and enjoy. The film is so incredibly sweet and innocent. Don't tear it apart. Don't analyze it. Just treat it like the wonderful little gem that it is and enjoy it.

I can only speculate why they moved this from an August release to October. This is the kind of crowd-pleaser that should be given the full backing of summer season advertising, marketing, and audience availability.  Serendipity is your typical boy-loses-girl story where you know from the beginning how it's going to end (but anything but typical because it's actually romantic and actually funny). As with any romance, it's the journey that matters. It's what Jon and Sara discover about themselves while they're looking for each other.   Serendipity reunites John Cusack with Jeremy Piven, who again plays the best friend role. Pound for pound, the Grosse Pointe Blank scenes are better, but there aren't as many. Piven's Dean has a lot more screen time here. Some of the funniest scenes feature these two, sleuthing their way through New York City (and SF briefly) searching for a girl Jonathan can't forget. The story is very nicely scripted. There's never a dull moment, really. Act II, which typically is the middle, longest portion of the story, is the parallel stories of Jon and Sara longing for each other while not completely into their respective future spouses. For both of them it's as if they're both trapped in the wrong life. Then comes the search, with Jon using a more clinical approach (sales receipts, addresses, phone #'s) and Sara using gut instinct. The whole time you're thinking 'it's not going to work because they're trying too hard' and you're right. They keep missing each other, sometimes only by inches. Writer Marc Klein convinces the audience that they are meant to be together, even as he convinces Jon and Sara that maybe it wasn't meant to be after all.I wasn't surprised to see The Mighty, one of 1998's best films, among director Peter Chelsom's credits. One minor folly on Serendipity was casting Molly Shannon, who I'll never be able to take seriously, as Sara's best friend. Her character mirrors Piven's but the role is noticeably smaller. Much of it was likely cut. Chelsom's direction coupled with John de Borman's understated cinematography make this film like a valentine to New Yorkers. Big Apple, be proud. Odd that two films set in NYC (the other being Don't Say a Word) ended up opening the same weekend, with that locale being crucial to the story.

I like John Cusack, and Kate Beckinsale is beautiful, for sure. The music is good, especially the two songs used in the final scene. The store clerk part, played by the guy who's also the dad in American Pie, is hilarious. The Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon best friend parts are good, and the obit written by Piven's character for Cusack's character borders on profound.BUT--here's my beef with the movie perhaps part of the reason why so many marriages fail these days is that we have been seduced by the typical Hollywood romantic fantasy (of which this film is a textbook case), which can be summarized like this all you need to be happy in love is to find that ONE PERSON meant for you. The trick is finding that person, and once you do, you've got it made. There's nothing else to do.Get real, people. There is a crucial difference between being in love with the IDEA of a person (nurtured by both lead characters for seven years in this movie, after they spend a few hours together) and living out a committed relationship, day in and day out, for a lifetime together. You need a whole lot more than the sentimental love portrayed here to make a relationship last until death parts you. Real relationships have to get by on commitment to stick with it, and not much else, at least from time to time. True love is not created from an evening together and some sort of sense of destiny; it is built a day at a time, a year at a time.I know, some will tell me to lighten up. I don't reject romance completely. But let me try a paradox on you You can create a lasting relationship with any number of people. There is no such thing as that one right person; the belief in that fantasy probably leads many a person to shy away from the hard work that it takes to build a lasting love relationship. Once it gets a little difficult, one is tempted to say, I must not have made the right choice. I have to keep looking. But here's the paradox part through sticking it out with your partner through thick and thin, etc., eventually you may come to believe that indeed, this was the right person for you. Maybe destiny plays a role, but destiny (or God, or whatever you want to call it) needs the cooperation of the two people involved over the long haul.So let's not get too enamored of this story as though it offers some deep truth about love. I'd much rather see a movie that grapples with the hard work of a lifelong commitment. Maybe there are some, but that would be quite difficult to do in two hours on the screen. The problem is that most of us don't want such realism in our movies; we crave the fantasy.

It succeeds in its intent, to charm me. It happens almost never with date movie because the conventions and expectations are so rigid. That makes them obvious and invites me to step outside. But this worked for me, and it might for you.I think it is because it does three things. The first is that it is remarkably competent; film-making &#151; at least this kind &#151; requires attention to so many elements. This is quite simply one of the most well engineered date movies I have ever seen in terms of those elements. No risks, no innovation, no real art except in the performances. Just polish, skill, craft.The second is that it unashamedly touches on romance, the heart of romance as well see in movies. Its a rich notion that probably exists only in movies and a few magical times with the person you love &#151; so you know it is real. But cinema inflates and freezes it for you to hold. Perhaps that is not so wise, but it is what romantic films are about and this plays those keys.The third thing is what interests me the most. Mind you, I only suss this out afterward. I have recently come to appreciate the invention of what I'll call noir, the noir world of fate. Its entirely a movie notion that as we watch, we become gods and goddesses that (perhaps against our wills) change the world we see so that coincidences apply. Often they are unhappy, but noir fate can work the other way as well. Not usually; it takes some clever invention which we have here. Its why there's mention of Cassiopeia. See? (I mean that literally.)Its such an attractive idea, that two souls are fated to meet, (one a film producer, the other an analyst). They were born to be together, born alike in some fundamental way. The world will contrive to make the natural fit. Its something to yearn for, and that's what date movies are for a pinnacle of happiness in love.This captured me. I suppose it was fate. I wish something similar for you.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

OK--- that might fly, given the whole soul mate destiny motif of the movie. But then he becomes engaged to a sweet, attractive woman who obviously loves him very much, and even the night before his wedding to this innocent and utterly charming lady he STILL chooses to chase after this rather frigteningly stubborn memory he has of the English girl. Why does this movie think that dumping and hurting such a nice person is somehow overlookable, or OK in the ridiculous and insulting pursuit of plot?And then there is is frustration comedy element. Endless sequences of near-misses and other cosmically crossed-wires are irritating. The main characters are also joyless, apparently suffering from some form of advanced anhedonia, or at least profound ingratitude. We are supposed to think this is poignant? Romantic? Funny? I really can't guess what on earth was going through the writer and director's minds when they concocted this hurtful mess.In real life, if you ever encounter anyone as stalky and obsessed as the character John Cusak plays here, call the police at once!

The movie intends to send the explicit message that though many things seem to happen by accident, there is destiny involved and every individual is responsible for shaping his or her destiny in life.Serendipity means good luck by accident which is exactly how Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) and Sara (the ravishing Kate Beckinsale) meet up while shopping for Christmas gifts in a departmental store in New York. They both select the same gift i.e. a glove which John subsequently gives up in return for a lovely blended coffee at Sara's favorite New York restaurant called Serendipity. For a background, Jonathan, an ESPN producer in New York is soon to marry his girlfriend Haley while Sara, a student counselor in San Francisco is soon to tie the knot with her boyfriend who is a flute musician. Jonathan is one who lives by rationale in life and believes there is a reason behind everything in life and that one is in-charge of it. On the other hand Sara is a firm believer in fate and destiny and believes that one will always land up where one was supposed to be. They engage in numerous such games to see how fate holds up for them and the lift incident is almost poignant to a point.Sara finally leaves New York with her telephone number written on a book which she will sell to a bookstore and if she and John are meant to be together, then John will find this book and be able to call her. Similarly she gets John to write his number on a 5-dollar bill. She says that if the bill comes back to her she will know that they were meant to be together. What follows is one accident after another which convinces John that she is the girl for him and starts an expedition to search for her in a very methodical manner. In this place the story slowly moves around to the point telling us that if we want something we have to fight for it. We cannot expect luck to give it to us. We see that even Sara returns to New York to search for her man, a woman well changed to make her own luck. At the end John has run out of ideas but feels vindicated.Though one might become overly pessimistic regarding the number of favorable accidents that happen in the movie, the beauty of this movie lies in its subtlety. The use of the gloves to indicate both separation and hope is truly brilliant. The subsequent depiction of the gloves throughout the movie allows the viewers to relate very closely with the protagonists. Characters in this movie have been developed with care and depth; whether they are John and Sara's friends or the salesman at the departmental store. The scenes at the Central Park skating rink are not only moving but very beautiful as well as John lies there in hope of finding his true love in life. And last but not the least, the music by Alan Silvestri is of the highest quality and adds a definitive emotional appeal to this already beautiful movie.

They both grabbed the same pair gloves, which was the last black pair left in the store and they basically felt a spark between them right there. Both of them were in relationships, but because of this magical spark, they decided to go out for a little bit that evening,  by going for an ice-cream at a little cafe called, Serendipity and going ice-skating. When they have to part, Jonathan wants to take things further by getting Sara's phone number and getting in contact with her again, but Sara isn't sure if this the right thing to do, as she believes in fate and thinks that if they're really meant for each-other, then they will be. A deal was made, Jonathan would write his phone number on a dollar bill and Sara would write her phone number in a book and sell it to a used book store. If they're both meant to be together, then Jonathan would find the book and Sara would find the dollar bill. This is where they leave each-other and go there separate ways. Many years later though, after still not seeing each-other, both are engaged to be married. They still can't stop thinking of each-other and go on there own little adventure with each of there best friends in search of one another and to see if they are really meant to be together.The cast in the movie, including, John Cusack, Kate Beckinsale, (Who both make a great pair here.), Molly Shannon, Jeremy Piven and the brilliant Eugene Levy who is really funny here, are all great in the movie.*** Spoiler*** Serendipity is a lovely light-hearted comedy which will be enjoyed by everyone, especially if you're into romantic comedies. The good thing with the movie is, it's not that predictable like many other movies out there. Okay, fine we all know that at the end of the movie, Sara and Jonathan will get together, but the way they do is quite different then you may expect. The movie has loads of little twists and turns all the way, which makes the movie good and it keeps you interested almost all the way through.  *** Spoiler*** I give Serendipity a 10/10.

The plot premise is about as silly as the former, while it has some of the acting charm and New York locales of the latter.John Cusack (as usual) makes the movie worthwhile as he gets so intensely involved in his romantic search. Ah, the poignancy on his face of the silent scene when he realizes that fate really has selected his impossible-to-find soul-mate. He and Jeremy Piven should clearly make a whole series of buddy movies as they exemplify what the Ozzies call mateship, such as Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau do, as in Made.The distaff pair just isn't as interesting. Yeah, Kate Beckinsale is pretty, but that's it. Molly Shannon, as The Best Friend, is much toned down from SNL. While John's fiancée is a bland bore, at least Kate's fiancé is a satirical hoot, with John Corbett as a savagely satirized Yanni. But that New Age nonsense is confused throughout the story line about fate. I got lost in the lame discussions about signals vs. signs vs. no coincidences, etc. (which was much better discussed in Happy Accidents.) Of course my limitations in losing myself in the movie were hampered by the 3 young women in back of me who translated the entire movie (even when there was no dialog) into some Eastern European language. I guess Shush! didn't translate.Points off to the movie for filming mostly in Toronto with just some establishing shots in NYC, mostly in front of the Waldorf Astoria.The soundtrack had some interesting selections - David Gray, Nick Drake, Shawn Colvin-- but not songs that were either strong lyrically to the plot or strong on their own, and really weakened by the over-the-credits Evan and Jaron.(originally written 10/7/2001) "},{"Title":"Nevertheless, the ultimate goal !","Date":"27 January 2005","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" It is said that watching a movie is always nearest to watching a life...well, not always, BUT  you might say this movie does it ...and it also revolutionizes the movie industry by introducing commercials that really fit into movies, things that are part of the script and not some T3 or Cellular movie flings.For me both the script and the actors ( Cusack really outdone itself) draw the line and that line will only be crossed few times.And for the last but not least  This movie definitely has to get a remake .Not for the sake of money but for the fans (Oops, I've said it !)

Kate Beckinsale plays a starry-eyed moron who drifts through life trying to read signs in everything that happens around her, like Jim Carrey did in that movie The Number 23. But this movie doesn't paint her as a dangerous obsessive compulsive, or a psychopath, it paints her as a kind of free spirited saint who can do no wrong, full of giddy wisdom and kindness.John Cusack plays a John Cusack character, which means he is good looking and quiet except for little fits now and then. He meets her at a mall, they fall in love at first sight, but instead of making plans to see each other again, she writes his number on a $5 and spends it, telling him that when that bill finds its way back to her, she'll call him.Any normal man would see her as insane and just walk away, but not John Cusack, because this is a movie. He is immediately infected with the same obsessive compulsiveness as she, and looks for signs in everything, and looks for faults in his innocent fiancée (who does not deserve to be put through this garbage just because he is disloyal and unfaithful).Beckinsale has a weird beatnik musician fiancée who is absolutely perfect for her, but she is constantly testing his every action to see if the universe is telling her to dump him. She is appalled at every fault she finds in him.These two undestined lovers get it in their heads that they are destined, they ruin their fiancée's lives, and run around like idiots trying to find each other without trying, if that makes any sense. I know what would happen in real life to people who did stuff like this they would spiral into depression and go begging their fiancees to take them back and be refused, or they would find each other and then have to break up the first time some unpleasant thing randomly happened to her (because it would be a sign). So, that's what would happen in real life. Guess what happens in the movie, though? Far be it from ME to spoil the ending...

The main characters, how do I say this in a family friendly forum, were jerks to put it mildly. The movie's obvious goal was to make me like them and root for them to wind up together. But by the end of the movie, I saw them as the villains with the way they treated their fiancées. But I've gotten ahead of myself here, my bad, my apologies.The premise of the movie is that John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale meet at a store at the beginning of the movie and hit it off (both characters were stated as currently dating others at the time, establishing what would an annoying pattern of behavior throughout the film.) Beckinsale's flaky character suggests writing their numbers on a 5 dollar bill and a book and if they come across them, they were meant to be together.Some time later, Cusack is engaged to Bridget Moynahan and Beckinsale is engaged to John Corbett's character. Both of the fiancé's are decent and don't deserve the treatment they get from our villai- I mean main characters, so sorry. Cusack spends the whole of his week before he is supposed to be married looking for that book with Beckinsale's number and Beckinsale isn't much better. Their callous disregard for their fiancé's caused me to lose any interest to care about them. I felt particularly bad for Bridget Moynahan's character, who proved to be a nice and lovely fiancé who really loved Cusack's character, yet was set up for heartbreak. The end of the movie evoked sympathy for the supporting character fiancé's and rage at the main characters, who I saw having no redeeming qualities.As I said, I enjoy romantic comedies when they are well done. Part of well done means making the main characters likable to the point where you are rooting for them to get together and you cheer at the end when/if the happy ending comes.Here, the main characters, I thought were self-absorbed inconsiderate people who I pretty much considered villains at the end. So to me, this particular romantic comedy failed on its goal.I do not recommend this movie.

It's bad enough the main characters of this movie have the emotional maturity level of fourteen-year-olds (actually I've known better fourteen-year-olds...), except maybe for Jeremy Piven, who was enjoyable enough. Just the first 15 minutes or so of the movie where Kate Beckinsale's character plays that annoying silliness of a game about throwing all sensibility to the wind (literally) had my best friend and I irritated beyond belief. I told my husband Rockstar had more intelligence, and at least, the characters in Rockstar weren't half as dysfunctional as the idiots were in this Serendipitous mess. It's annoying to watch protagonists who seem to have no clue about choice in their lives, and feel they're nothing more than puppets to destiny and the whims of fate. How utterly tiresome. I'm sure this movie will be more likely enjoyed by those who'd rather not engage in the chaotic messiness of making more complex life choices and then responsibly living with the consequences. After all, here's a movie where our hero and heroine live happily ever after only after wreaking havoc and misery on two other people's lives (namely their respective fiancées), not to mention other relatives and friends, just to get there.

In how-to-draw portrait books, we are taught to start with sketched lines to define a classic head shape, then to divide the face into perfectly even segments &#x96; few people in real life actually fit those idealised proportions, however Kate Beckinsale does &#x96; and she has never been more lovingly photographed than in this movie.Along with her polished English accent, and her understated style, she is a disarming package. It actually makes believable that John Cusack's Jonathon would keep her memory fresh after meeting her for only one night five years before.Cusack is interesting for other reasons. There always seems to be something else going on beneath that somewhat cynical surface. I'm not sure romantic comedy is as natural for him as it is for her. He seems more defined by edgier fare such as The Grifters or The Frozen Ground. However, that may be just the right energy for this role because for much of the film Jonathan is engaged to another woman while desperately seeking Sara.The production is a stylish one, and exudes a romantic quality. If there is a disappointment it is that genuinely witty lines are a little hard to come by in Serendipity.Normally a comedy can get a lot of mileage out of best man speeches, but the one delivered by Jeremy Pivan's character is a bit of a misfire. Other lines although milked hard, don't quite make it.Fortunately, the scene where Jonathan encounters the sales clerk played by Eugene Levy delivers laughs lacking in other places &#x96; sales clerks, whether acid tongued, prissy or totally obsequious, rarely fail to get laughs in comedies, especially when in the hands of expert practitioners such as W.C. Fields, Paul Lynde or Larry Miller in Pretty Woman.Serendipity doesn't quite line up with my personal favourites of the genre Four Weddings and a Funeral, Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail. However, it features two engaging stars, who skate serenely over the cracks in an unapologetically over-the-top story.

I guess everyone has someone they're meant to end up with. The name's of the two people are Jonathan and Kate, Kate describes Serendipity as a fortunate accident. Which describes the movie perfectly because them meeting was supposed to happen and usually accidents aren't good, but in this movie it was a good thing that they did meet. The way that the universe kept sending them signals of each other before they met again was interesting. Both of them almost gave up because they didn't know where else to find each other. They then met again at the Ice Rink where they went after meeting and were together for a long time. This movie is a great movie to watch at any time, but better during around the holidays because it's around winter season in the movie.

The basic premise is of two star-crossed lovers who are meant to be together with their human beliefs pushing them apart while the rest of the universe is trying to push them back together where they belong. It is so much fun watching this special pairing of John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale at their all-time best.This is classic John Cusack - the tortured, intelligent soul who falls for the perfect girl, then watches her disappear by her own destiny devices which crushes him. Five years later, he's engaged to someone else but can never get his perceived soul-mate out of his mind. There are times where Cusack (whom I adore) will overact/appear schizophrenic and sociopathic in some romantic comedies. This, however, is one of his best. He's simply believable and sympathetic in his quest to put right what went wrong so many years before.Kate Beckinsale --- With the exception of her character's destiny-speak at the opening, she's the most perfect leading lady in which Cusack will drop anything (and actually, everything if you think about it) to finally track down and begin a life together. Charming, beautiful, intelligent, flawed, strong... She's exceptional.Now, add Molly Shannon and Jeremy Piven as the equally-neurotic best friends of both our heroes, plus the added joy of watching the ever-reliable funnyman, Eugene Levy, stealing every scene in the Bloomingdale's search... The casting director deserves an honorary Well done! for their choices. Throw in the amazing New York skyline and Central Park in all it's splendor...This movie may not be perfect. But if you are thinking of watching a movie with your significant other to make you laugh, cry, hold onto one another in a romantic embrace so they never, ever go away... This is that movie. It never gets old. It seems fresh every time I see it. A great example was my 14yo foster daughter watching this for the first time. Her reaction as the lead characters miss each other by inches once again was - I HATE this movie!!!... Only to have her at the end tell me how much she LOVED the movie. It was awesome!!It isn't perfect, but compared to all the recent The Notebook-knockoffs filling up movie theaters and video rentals at an alarming rate considering they are neither good NOR romantic, I'd recommend renting this again simply for the feel-good factor. 9 out of 10 for sheer pleasantness and simplicity that makes me smile at the end every time.

They have a chance meeting at a department store, which leads to an amazing evening. But then Sara wants to leave things to chance by marking their information on a 5 dollar bill and a book and putting both out in circulation (there's also a ridiculous scene where they get on two elevators..if they end up on the same floor, they're supposed to be together).

Jonathan and Sara are both getting married (to different people, naturally), but neither can get that chance meeting out of their minds, and both set out on a last ditch effort to find each other. The lengths that Jonathan in particular goes to, with the help of his best friend Dean (Piven, the straw that stirs the drink in this), make for a couple of priceless scenes, including one with an anal retentive clerk at the department store (Eugene Levy).Piven is perfect as Dean, who helps Jonathan in his search despite the fact that he thinks his soon-to-be married buddy is off his rocker (what best friends do). Toward the end, when it looks like all is lost, Dean marvels at what Jonathan has gone through to find Sara. He laments about how the passion which Jonathan put into his search is something he let slip away in his own marriage.It's this, plus the chemistry between Cusack and Beckinsale, that make this movie worth seeing despite the ridiculously silly premise..and predictable ending.

They are great in this and that allows you to ignore some silly plot developments. John Cusack is irresistible as Jonathan in this divine romance farce. The following cast is phenomenal. One of the good movies in romantic genre, Serendipity will inspire the viewer to believe in destiny. Jonathan (John Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckinsale) meet in Bloomingdales when they both want to purchase the same pair of gloves. The attraction is instant and they spend a romantic evening cavorting around New York City together. At the end of the evening John wants to see her again, but Sara decides that if it is fate that they should be together, they will find each other again. She drives away in a cab and he never sees her again. Well, almost never.Years go by and both of them are about to be married, but each still has this nagging feeling that the other was his/her one true love. Of course fate conspires to bring them back together (after about a dozen near misses) as they each simultaneously undertake one last attempt to find one another just before they get married to someone else.The fate angle is plowed mercilessly, almost to the point of nausea, but the skits are funny and the chemistry between Cusack and Beckinsale is enchanting. Cusack is an expert at playing the tortured and neurotic lover, but here he is more haunted and forlorn than dysfunctional. Kate Beckinsale rocketed from obscurity to prominence with her performance in 'Pearl Harbor' and proves to be a wonderful romantic lead in this film. The film also benefits from outstanding comedic support from Jeremy Piven as Jonathan's best friend and devoted Sara sleuth. Piven's zany comedy proves to be the perfect complement to Cusack's wry despondency. Eugene Levy is a scream as the eccentric Bloomingdales salesman, who blackmails Jonathan into buying half the store to give him information from Sara's charge account. Serendipity is a lovely light-hearted comedy which will be enjoyed by everyone, especially if you're into romantic comedies. The good thing with the movie is, it's not that predictable like many other movies out there. Okay, fine we all know that at the end of the movie, Sara and Jonathan will get together, but the way they do is quite different then you may expect. The movie has loads of little twists and turns all the way, which makes the movie good and it keeps you interested almost all the way through.

Over the course of the evening the two come to realise that they may be each other's destiny, but when they decide to put it to the test, they become separated and Cusack spends the next few years looking for the one that got away.John Cusack is an at times frustrating, neurotic actor who seems to only play varying shades of the same character. Nothing more true of his performance herein, and yet, it works. I actually thought Kate Beckinsale wasn't as strong or committed in her performance, but the supportive cast including Piven as Cusack's tubby best friend and Brigitte Moynahan as his unfortunate fiancée add to the spark. Eugene Levy is amusing in a brief two-scene cameo as a store salesman.There's something undeniably feel-good about this movie, which offers no real surprises, but still manages to keep you guessing on the how and when aspects. Somewhat reminiscent of Four Weddings and a Funeral, it's an easy-going light romantic comedy that's one of the best of its ilk.

It was written by Marc Klein and directed by Peter Chelsom.Jonathan and Sara are two New Yorkers already in relationships when they meet one another, each reaching for the last pair of cashmere gloves at a department store. Over coffee, they strike up an intimate conversation, and Jonathan thinks they should see each other again. Unconvinced, Sara arranges an elaborate series of fate games; if they're meant to be together, she reasons, she and Jonathan will receive some sort of sign in the future. Flash forward several years, and the two are at opposite ends of the country -- Jonathan in New York and Sara in San Francisco, both engaged to be married. Still, neither can shake the memory of their chance encounter, and they both enlist their best friends to help them find their true love again. Although the movie is both formulaic and contrived,one cannot find it not hard to enjoy this one.Both Cusack and Beckinsale give fine performance and charismatic portrayals despite of not being on screen together for most part of the film.But nevertheless,the story maybe considered lightweight but it is not difficult to find delight while watching this film.

No, no&#x85;don't get me wrong, I did like this, I just didn't find it GREAT and despite the same ole story, SEE the superior 'Sleepless in Seattle,' I was kinda disturbed after the first act because I found these two characters/actors (including John Cusack) had such beautiful chemistry. And like fate, they're torn apart and we're to spend another 1+ hours of them trying to reconnect. Worse, they're both engaged to their own partners and not enough &#x96; make that VERY LITTLE &#x96; was shown to me that they didn't belong to their current fiancés. Thankfully, that hour I wish I could see that chemistry growing, we have some decent secondary characters, namely Jonathan's (Cusack) friend, Dean (Jeremy Piven.) My only real complaint, as this was a decent movie, was it's really hard to find wonderful chemistry between two leads and here they had it and then hid it in the form of fate. Sad and yet, I recommend it, if not just for the first twenty beautiful minutes.

It's such a nice sounding word for what it means a fortunate accident.¨ I never thought the time would come in which I'd see this movie because unfortunately I had caught the ending on cable and therefore spoiled the rest of the film. However, I happened to come across Serendipity again and decided to watch it from the beginning this time, and what a pleasure it was. Even though I knew how the story was going to end, it was a delight to watch the story unravel. We know how these romantic movies are going to end most of the time, but the important thing is the story and the chemistry between the lead characters; and Serendipity didn't disappoint me. I was hooked from the very opening scene in the store, and there seemed to be something magical going on. It didn't matter whether or not I had seen the ending because the important thing was seeing this romantic story come to life. The chemistry between the two lead roles was really believable. It's as if I was destined to watch this movie the way I did so that I wouldn't focus so much on how predictable the movie might be, but rather enjoy the love story and the chemistry between the actors. The dialogue in this film, written by Marc Klein, was also great and there were several memorable lines. In my opinion this is by far Peter Chelsom's best film thanks to a great dual performance from John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale who really shine together on screen.It all happens one magical night Jonathan (John Cusack) is doing some Christmas shopping for his girlfriend and while grabbing the last remaining pair of black gloves he runs into Sara (Kate Beckinsale) who is also thinking of buying them for her lover. Being the gentleman he is Jonathan insists that Sarah take the gloves, but he can't help but feel some magical connection between them. They decide to share a drink together at Serendipity and they spend the night getting to know each other, although Sara never reveals her last name to him. She says that if they are meant to be together then fate will make them cross paths again. She writes her full name and phone number on a book cover (¨Love in the Time of Cholera¨) and says she will give it away to a used bookstore. If they are meant to be together then he will be able to find the book; Jonathan does the same thing on a five dollar bill. Unfortunately fate doesn't give them a hand at first and each goes their separate way. Seven years later Jonathan, who still lives in New York and works for ESPN, is about to get married with Halley (Bridget Moynahan). His best friend, Dean (Jeremy Piven), gives a funny speech on their engagement night, but Jonathan begins to see some signals that remind him of that magical night he shared with Sara. Meanwhile, Sara is living in California and is also about to get married with a New Age musician named Lars (John Corbett). She also begins to get cold feet about the wedding and begins to see some signs that remind her of the night she spent with Jonathan. She decides to travel to New York for the weekend with her best friend, Eve (Molly Shannon), and see if she can find information on Jonathan. Thus the plot thickens and the fun begins.The chemistry between Beckinsale and Cusack is just unbelievable. Those few scenes they share together at the beginning of the film are so magical that we want the two of them to find their way back together. Somehow we want to believe in fate and soul mates, and these two characters represent just that because we want them to be together even though they both seem to have good relationships with their partners, who don't play the typical bad boyfriend/girlfriend character. The movie is not all romance; there are also several funny scenes Piven and Shannon have some memorable comedic scenes. Beckinsale is as beautiful as ever in this film, and Cusack is at his best playing this sort of charismatic role. The entire cast really shines in this film making this love story all that more believable. Serendipity is one of those few romantic Hollywood movies that actually works thanks to a great love story, good performances, and memorable dialogues. We all want to believe in love and how fate can give us a hand when it comes to finding our soul mate; and Serendipity works so well at getting this point across that it can turn the most skeptic person into a believer. It doesn't matter if the ending is predictable or not, the most important thing about Serendipity is how we get to that finale; learning how to read those signs and enjoying the love story. In my opinion Serendipity will rank among those great romantic films.http//estebueno10.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Serendipity (n) fortunate accident","Date":"6 April 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" If I were to be asked right now to make a choice between my future career versus my future so-called soulmate, I would choose my career, no questions. I'm just really a strong believer that love isn't everything. I don't think it's right for people to drop down all that they have just to give love a chance. Call me a skeptic, but that's just my belief. Nevertheless, I cannot deny that I really did enjoy this movie.Jon (John Cusak) and Sara (Kate Beckinsale) were two strangers who met one morning in a crowded department store by accident. They share a short cup of coffee and a nice conversation afterward. We learn that Sara is a strong believer that fate controls everyone's life. She implies that she met Jon because of fate. After their meeting, they part ways, not giving their contact number to each other directly, and leave everything up to fate. The movie takes place a few years later after their initial meeting and we see both of them trying to find the other desperately.John Cusak and Kate Beckinsale were perfect for the leads. Jon was lovable, determined and oh-so-romantic. Sara's trust on fate and destiny went a bit overboard, but it worked! I loved this movie. It had everything a romantic-comedy movie needs.

One for sure is a great woman. John Cusack is definitely one of the luckiest man in the world. In Serendipity his muse is Kate Beckinsale. She's young and so cute. An extremely hot woman.

"},{"Title":"A good love story set amongst unbelievable probabilities.","Date":"20 April 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" How many of us doesn't like a good love story with some humour & some melancholy. I think the rom-coms of the 30s, 40s & 50s are amongst the best in Hollywood history. We have such precious gems such as Adam's Rib, Roman Holiday, It Happened One Night, My Man Friday & the list goes on. The next 3 decades saw a decline in this genre save some rare exceptions such as Annie Hall. But the last 2 decades saw a revival of sorts. I think the success of When Harry Met Sally & Pretty Woman has a lot to do with this.I like many rom-coms from the last 2 decades but if you ask me to name 3 movies that I absolutely adore from the last 21 years, I would say 10 Things I Hate About You, My Sassy Girl (not the English version but the Korean version Yeopgijeogin Geunyeo) & Serendipity.I actually saw Serendipity for the 1st time only a year after its release. At that time I haven't seen many rom-coms & also I wasn't thinking about movies in a critical way analysing their good, bad & ugly. It was just some rom-com which I was seeing to waste some time. But by the first 15 minutes, I started to love the movie. Partly because of the interesting start but more importantly due to Kate Beckinsale about whom I never heard of before & who will always remain my 1st Hollywood crush.Serendipity is directed by Peter Chelsom & written by Marc Klein. While shopping for Christmas, strangers Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) & Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) try to buy the same pair of gloves at a store. After Jonathen gives them to her, they feel some kind of attraction towards each other although they already have their lovers. So they spend some time with each other by eating & skating. When the shamelessly flirting Jonathan proposes to exchange their numbers, Sara has a better idea. She makes him write his name & number on a $5 note & gives that note in a shop. She says that she will write her name & number on a book that she will sell the next day. So if they are destined to be with each other, they will find other's contact someday. They leave each other after this AMAZING BRILLIANT idea.After a few years, Jonathan is engaged to Halley Buchanan (Bridget Moynahan) & Sara is about to get engaged to Lars Hammond (John Corbett). All these years they do think about each other but they don't even know their full names to find each other. After seeing some 'signs', both of them decide to try for one last time to find each other. Jonathan has his friend Dean Kansky (Jeremy Piven) to help him & Sara has her friend Eve (Molly Shannon). Do they find each other? If so will they leave their respective partners who are such good people? See the movie for answers although I know anybody could guess what happens at the end of a rom-com.John Cusack & Kate Beckinsale have very little screen time together but whenever they do share a scene they share good chemistry. Their roles are not meant to win an Oscar & they deliver what's required. The best part in acting comes from the supporting cast. I loved the role of Dean Kansky. Molly Shannon as Eve was also very good. Eugene Levy has a very funny cameo as sales man in the movie.Another thing for which I like the movie so much is its score. It is composed by 2 time Academy award nominated Alan Silvestri who is one of the busiest in the business. This is not his best by any means. He has given background to such movies as Forrest Gump, Back to the Future series, The Polar Express amongst others. But the music in Serendipity is different & it caught my attention.If at all there is one thing to improve, it is the dialogue of the movie. It is kind of mishmash wherein some scenes I like it & in some other scenes I hate. Some of the dialogue at the start is so sugary that you wouldn't eat anything sweet for a few hours.Coming to the story, the only problem with the story is the probability of its occurrences. It's all fate fate fate fate in the movie. In fact IMDb has this movie under fantasy genre & rightly so. You would never see so many coincidences in a story to move it forward. They could have mentioned in the movie that the main purpose & existence of the universe is to somehow unite Jonathan & Sara. If you don't give much thought to the improbability of the story, you will definitely enjoy this.Many of you may disagree with my rating, but it's like a first love to me where the good things always appear magnified & the faults diminished.Love to hear what you have to say about Serendipity, http//amarsmoviejournal.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Serendipity","Date":"13 December 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" This romantic comedy was rated three out of five by the critics, so I knew this wasn't going to be cheesy and not very exciting stuff, but I do like some good cheese, from director Peter Chelsom (Funny Bones). Basically Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) and Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) meet in New York City, in a shop called Serendipity, both looking for a pair of gloves. It is obvious there was love in the air that night in Christmas time, despite both having lovers, so they decide to test their fate by splitting up and seeing if destiny would bring them back together. So they took a glove each, Sara wrote her name and contact number in a specific book, and Jonathan wrote his name and contact number on a dollar bill. Years later, both of them are engaged to be married, but neither can not forget each other, and begin a little journey to find each other again. Jonathan tries to get his friend Dean Kansky (Scary Movie 3's Jeremy Piven) to find her, and Sara takes her friend Eve (The Grinch's Molly Shannon) to New York to search. There are a number of near-misses confusion along the way, but eventually they happen to chance on each other's ways of contact, and find each other at the ice rink for their fate and happy ending at Christmas. Also starring John Corbett as Lars Hammond, Bridget Moynahan as Halley Buchanan, Eugene Levy as Bloomingdale's Salesman and Lucy Gordon as Caroline Mitchell. Obviously the plot is very long shot material, but it has to be, and even though it a bit mushy, Cusack and Beckinsale just about keep it going, so it is reasonably entertaining.

I also agree with comments about the predictability and unrealistic nature of the movie to a degree. However, when I watch romantic comedies, I do not look for surprise endings or documentaries.The majority of the negatives reviewers condemn the Sarah Thomas character for testing or tempting fate. I kinda agree that she should not have done this. The negative reviewers also focus on what reviewers consider the unrealistic concept of fate taking charge in this movie.My own critique would be that the climax of this movie was not as good as other romantic comedy climaxes. Considering all of that, I found this movie had an uplifting message, that fate, will control what takes place, and that Fate/Karma will work things out in the end. I like that concept. Many do not. I believe in a higher all seeing all knowing power that causes justice to prevail in the long run. The uplifiting message of the movie combined with great music and the unrelenting, tension-packed, two-front chase throughout the movie made this movie worth it to watch.

'Serendipity' is very much a typical romantic comedy in the fashion of 'You've Got Mail'. Chelsom pretty much does a decent job in crafting the film. I liked his use of music (which creates a diverse soundtrack) and his use of props. Some of the visuals are stunning. The story follows the traditional romantic comedy track this time with destiny being the puppet-master but it has its charm because the humour in this one is dry and subtle and the dialogues are clever and interesting.For a romantic movie to work it is compulsory that the lead pair have at least good chemistry. Cusack and Beckinsale really make it work. They are like electric. You really feel that Jon and Sarah are falling in love and root for fate to take their side and get them together. I doubt there are many actors who can play 'regular guy' as excellently as John Cusack. His performance comes across as very natural on screen, with spot-on dialogue delivery and brilliant comic timing. Kate Beckinsale is incredibly beautiful and very lively. She's a solid counterpart to John Cusack. Jeremy Pivens and Eugene Levy are outstanding. Pivens is just as great as Cusack and Levy, you have to watch and see to get what I mean. Molly Shannon too is good.Although, the storyline is pretty formulaic, I liked how some of the plots were wrapped nicely, for example, Jon and Sarah, without having found each other after their desperate sort of 'last minute' search, break off their relationships with their respective partners because they realize how unfair they have been towards them. There isn't the clichéd scene where Sarah walks in on Jon's wedding, followed by Jon dumping Halley at the alter etc etc.'Serendipity' is somewhat syrupy but most Hollywood movies of this genre are. But, the director does use a lot of subtle details. At times, the film also felt rushed. I would have liked to see a bit more development in the story (it is a very small movie). The main question is whether the film works. It doesn't bring anything particularly novel to the genre but it worked for me mainly because of the charming visuals, soundtrack and dialogue and the performances.

A chain of events is then set in place which leads to a highly obvious conclusion that makes for a very enjoyable ride. Not being a great fan of romantic comedies I always come to films of this genre with trepidation but found this to be the exception to the rule, a high quality rom-com which is actually an geared for adults and not the normal teen stuff. This is a well directed film which is kept together tightly with little to no wasted scenes, bring the film in at a respectable 90 minute running time which I feel is just about right for romantic comedies. The leads do very good jobs of their roles and remain enchanted by each other considering how little of the running time they actually spend in each other's company. Now it helps if like me you are a big fan of John Cusack, but he really does very well with this role bringing a real feel of reality to the role making a man who could seem shallow or even dastardly at times seem real and earthy. Kate Beckindale does the English rose thing well without being the over the top prim and proper English girl character that we quite often get presented with in American movies. They are well supported by the always magnificent Jeremy Piven (the man is such a subtle scene stealer!).

But, Jonathan insists that she buy them and they part company. But, a short while later, they meet again on the same spot, mainly because Jonathan has left his scarf behind and Sara is still shopping. Now, declares Jonathan, this is fate throwing them together and they should go get a cup of coffee together.

Jonathan wants Sarah's digits, despite the fact that both he and Sarah are involved with others. But, after writing down her telephone number, the wind wrestles the slip of paper out of Jon's hands. Sarah says she believes in fate, too, and that the timing must not be right. So, Jon goes his way and Sarah goes hers. Now, close to seven years later, Jon is about to marry beautiful Halley (Bridget Moynahan) and Sarah is just becoming engaged to Lars (John Corbett). Yet, Jonathan suddenly longs to find Sarah and see if what they felt for a few brief hours was real. How do you spell complications? This is a lovely film for those romantic dreamers of the world. Perhaps there is only one soulmate for each of us and, if we search long enough, he or she will be found. As the star-crossed lovers, Cusack and Beckinsale are terrific, touching and sincere. The rest of the cast, including the marvelous Jeremy Piven, the equally marvelous Eugene Levy, Moynahan, Corbett, Molly Shannon and others, is great, too. The script is imaginative and sweet while the costuming, scenery, and production values are extremely nice. If you have skipped over this one, do not let days or weeks go by before locating it at the video store.

As a big believer of fate and karma I really do believe stories like this happen. The film is almost enchanting and yes, it is enchantment created entirely by the two leads. John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale are superb. The story is all about two people who meet by chance and the girl, with an odd sense of humor and of how fate works decides to create a meet again if fate permits situation. Quite a time passes in their lives and they do through what can only be called fate, meet again and the story ends in the way the viewer would like.

However, whilst retaining far more homogeneity and continuity as 'When Harry met Sally&#133;', and being better paced in the unfolding of the drama, it does not match up to the best films of this genre, such as 'Conte d'hiver'.Kate Beckinsale dominates the film almost as much as Charlotte Véry dominated 'Conte d'hiver'. As much as the development of the story makes the viewer want to know how it continues, Kate Beckinsale holds the interest within each scene in which she appears with a magnificent portrayal of a normal person with a mixture of strengths and weaknesses.Films of this type often seem to be travelling towards a rather obvious conclusion, but this is also handled rather skilfully, so that the viewer has a satisfied feeling of not having experienced the end before it occurs.It is a very enjoyable, though not top class, film, with earnestness rationed so that one may be better engrossed by the light-heartedness.

This movie is definitely a movie to watch with somebody that you truly love. So the question is...will John and Sara hook up, or won't they? That's what you have to see, when you watch Serendipity.

Not that this story makes a bad movie, I really enjoyed the movie, I'm just saying it's been done before, was done afterward, and I'm sure will be done again.I suppose I shall now contrast Serendipity and Wicker Park since I have reviewed WP as well. There weren't any freaky scenes in the movie like there was in Wicker Park, which was better for me because I really don't care to see all of that. The music in Serendipity was good, however it certainly was no (The) Scientist.The only reasons I did not give Serendipity the same rating (or more than) as Wicker Park was not because of the acting or the story, but more towards the directing side. Paul McGuigan did an unreal job of directing Wicker Park and the way he was able to clearly (if you really think about it-and pay attention) tell almost the whole story backwards. Serendipity is simple, to the point, and...not...backwards, which is probably a good thing for people who don't have a long attention span, or time to sit and watch the whole movie at once. Serendipity also had more comedy in it than WP. All in all, I'd say that if you like either of these movies, you should give the other a try.Kate Beckinsale was a wonderful actress, as in any movies I have yet to see her in (PEARL HARBOR!! YEAH!!! WOO!!!!), and she's so beautiful! I was also very pleased with Jeremy Piven's job in the movie. He did a great job acting as the encouraging tag-along best friend.Life is not merely a series of meaningless accidents or coincidences, but rather it's a tapestry of events that culminate in an exquisite, sublime plan. I found it almost funny that we just-so-happened to watch this movie on December 23rd, and the beginning and the ending of the movie was Christmastime...who knows, maybe it was fate? ;) "},{"Title":"Refreshing","Date":"19 December 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" I don't know about you but when I go to the movies or I stay at home and watch one I want to end and feel happy.

This is why Serendipity was extremely refreshing, in my opinion. It is not that the plot is incredibly original nor excellently developed, but the movie certainly proves to be optimistic, funny and leaves you with a warm feeling after seeing it.Many of the lines in the movie can crack you up in laughter, either due to the witty writing or the brilliantly performances of the actors. Jeremy Piven is hilarious and they couldn't have cast a better wingman for Cusack. Some of the situations are funny just to think about them, and overall it is a nice movie.

It's all about fate and once in a lifetime happening twice.This is definitely a romantic comedy i.e. it's a chick flick, but it's one of the better ones out there and most men would probably be able to enjoy it (almost) as much.Overall I was surprised by how entertaining it was and it has a fair amount of very funny jokes. It's not John Cusack's best comedy (see High Fidelity) but it's one of his better attempts at playing a typical Nice Guy role in a romantic comedy - better than American Sweethearts, anyway.

However, the girl is a New Age Spirituality freak, and makes it oh so damn difficult for the guy to get anything out of her, even her name! It just drives a man insane, and she proceeds to make it so challenging and leave everything to Fate - Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) had to write his name and contact number on a five dollar bill, which Sara (Kate Beckinsale) proceeded to use, and if the note comes back to her because of Fate, she'll give him a call. On the other hand, she wrote hers on a book, which she will sell to a second hand book store, for Jonathan to look for and browse at each time he passes by a store.However another serendipitous game in a hotel finally made them part ways, but parting is such sweet sorrow, and each of them take active steps in seeking out each other when Fate comes aknocking - Jonathan seeks out Sara's last name, while Sara takes a trip to New York, and both make round trips around the Big Apple, revisiting places they have been to together.Fans of American Pie will cheer at the small scene where Eugene Levy appears as a conniving anal Bloomdale's salesman. And I like the scene using the Godfather movies as an analogy which Jonathan uses to explain his crush for Sara. While the couples shared Cassiopeia, I'll never forget my own Orion moment.The surprising thing though, is that you might bat an eyelid during the introduction. Both couples have their respective other halves (engaged, going to get married), but proceed to flirt so closely and strongly with each other, and to seek each other out. OK, perhaps Sara's Zen-music boyfriend is a bit of a jerk (it always plays out that way yeah?) but this is a Hollywood romance after all, one that deals with a fortunate accident.I've always been a fan of John Cusack - he's one of those underrated character actors in nice quirky movies; High Fidelity's still one of my favourites, and the soundtrack in this film is pretty cool too. And Kate Beckinsale, OK I confess, is the real reason why I'm watching this movie. They share a certain chemistry which is so enjoyable you're rooting for them to get back together as soon as possible to experience the magic again.So if you're feeling in the mood for a bit of cruel Fate filled romance comedy, then Serendipity is for you. Cuddle up with a loved one and pop this DVD into the player. Serendipity moments? Anytime for me -P Code 1 DVD Extras The gem in the extras are the deleted scenes. As mentioned above, some might bat an eyelid at the flirtation scene in which their respective partners are quickly forgotten. The deleted scenes were worse, so probably that's why they didn't make the final cut.

And, John, if you are out there and ever read this, my god do I love you. Back on track....Now, when I'm talking about the believability of the movie I'm not just talking about the reality that such coincidences may occur, so repetitiously, I am speaking more about the believability when it comes to the feelings the characters have for each other. You can feel it. I've actually felt the longing for someone in the period of 10-15 years and not knowing if I was ever to find them. My story doesn't come close to the drama these two had, or the romance, but my god if it doesn't make for a beautiful movie and wishful thinking. You know a chick flick as some call it is good when you're a woman who has a masculine husband that can sit with her and his male best friend and watch it, while making comments that it was actually a very well-played-out love story. That's when their cue is to exit out the back door to play basketball to regain their masculinity.Now, that's real life. "},{"Title":"A clichéd romantic comedy that works in spite of itself","Date":"29 July 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Serendipity is light and delightful, a romantic comedy that is both crowd-pleasing and cute, without being trite and simple. Sure, it has all the romantic comedy contrivances, and relies on a series of clichéd coincidences and well-worn shots of New York to get the audience to the satisfying ending. It by no means has re-invented the wheel here. Instead, it's just an above average wheel, one that you'll enjoy if you buy into the formula.The main reason why this film works where other romantic comedies fail is the cast. John Cusack proves there is no movie he can't class up by his presence, being the guy that women find attractive and smart, while guys identify with. He's the everyman for the hipster crowd. Cusack's Jonathan Trager is a funny, self-deprecating, engaging lead whose charisma carries the film. The gorgeous Kate Beckinsale plays Sara Thomas, the object of Trager's affection, being the cute, funny hot girl that would make a guy gladly jump through all the crazy hoops she places in front of him for a shot at her affections. They are both affable leads with solid chemistry that clicks well enough and fast enough that the audience becomes reasonably invested in their separate pursuits of each other through the rest of the movie (as they spend most of the movie apart from one another).Cusack's best friend Jeremy Piven plays the same best friend character he does in most of Cusack's movies, this time as Dean Kansky. As much chemistry as Cusack and Beckinsale manage in this movie, it can't help to match the chemistry Cusack and Piven have. It's their antics in the movie that cause Serendipity to rise above the otherwise average romantic comedy it should be, as they manage to be truly funny without resorting to the usual bumbling moron buddy tricks that lesser comedies fall back on. Adding to the mix is Eugene Levy, who steals every scene he's in as a Bloomington's Salesman who helps Trager and Kansky track down Sara.Another reason this movie stands out for me is that the respective significant others for Cusack and Beckinsale in the movie are both perfectly good people who care for their partners. Too often in movies like this one, the significant others that keep the main couple apart are portrayed as unlikeable people, the women are mousey shrews or controlling bitches, and the men are complete jerks. This is designed to make the audience cheer harder for the main couple to eventually get together. Unfortunately, it ends up making the main characters look stupid. Why would these people choose such beasts to be their girlfriend/boyfriend/fiancée? Are they that blind? Not so with Serendipity, where Bridget Moynahan brings a sweetness and genuine concern to Trager's fiancée Halley Buchanen and John Corbett does the same with Thomas' fiancée Lars Hammond. Corbett does a great comedic job with Hammond, a new age musician in the Yanni mold, who is a little weird and a little preoccupied with his career, but still a loving boyfriend. It's not that their other loves aren't good people, it's just that they're not the right people.I've watched this movie dozens of times now, and it only grows on me more each time. I still laugh out loud at many parts in the movie, and am always won over by the characters and the pursuit each time. In the hands of lesser performers, there's a good chance that it would be terrible. But it's not, it's simple and winning, even Molly Shannon is tolerable in it, playing a toned down version of the same character she always plays, this time as Sara's best friend Eve. If you're looking for a nice, warm romantic comedy, but aren't willing to accept the usual dumbed down offerings of the genre, than Serendipity is an excellent choice.

Serendipity isn't too sweet. It has the perfect mix of humor and romance, which keeps it all interesting from the beginning until the end.A man and a woman, who don't know each other, meet for the first time during their Christmas shopping, when they both want to buy the same pair of gloves. Because only one of them can have the gloves, they decide that the 'winner' will pay the other one a coffee in a coffee house nearby, which is called Serendipity. They have a great time together, but at the end she refuses to give him her phone number. As a great believer in fate, she believes that if they are meant for each other, fate will bring them back together anyway. She writes down her number and name in a book that she'll sell the next day. He'll have to write his number on a 5-dollar note. If he finds the book or if she gets the banknote, they will see each other again, if not, this will be their only encounter. Many years go by and they have never seen each other again. Both are about to marry someone else, but have never forgotten that special day. Before they get married, they will try to find each other again...Overall the acting in the movie is more than OK and the story is nice. The pace is good and the movie never annoyed me. I'm well aware that this may not be the most original movie and of course you already know how it will end as soon as the movie starts. Almost all of these movies end in the same way. I guess you could even call the entire movie unrealistic and unbelievable, but somehow it never bothered me. Perhaps I just wanted to escape the daily reality for 90 minutes, perhaps I just wanted to believe that people who are meant to be together will always find each other...

Marc Klein has an ear for the way New Yorkers talk, but he seems to have been influenced by other movies of this genre that have been done better and with more flair. Peter Chelsom's direction doesn't add anything to the story either.The idea that this pair that fates conjures to bring together at Bloomingdale's at the height of the Christmas shopping season, is a pleasant one, but just to think that these two newly discovered 'soul mates' will make it against all probabilities just by sharing some wicked looking desserts at Serendipity 3, is preposterous. I'm not saying it can't happen, but it's extremely rare to have a Sara so coy and so silly to think she wouldn't give Jonathan her phone number right away. It's not every day one finds a hunk like him to let the opportunity go by, acting the way she does. I mean, she should have called a limo and taken him home immediately, why wait?John Cusack has done better work than in this film. Kate Beckingsale is an actress that is not easy to classify, but in this film she is not shown at her best. This is not an unpleasant film to watch if one doesn't expect too much from it.

Surely keeping the emotional connection between the two leads over such a long time would have been a lot more plausible if there had been a little intimacy during their first night. Indeed, a giggly quickie with politely embarrassed apologies afterward would have fit the plot just fine.  Also, there didn't seem to have been a lot of thought put into the search for Sara's name and address.

But  just leave him in the movie. Certainly one can not bear to have such a guy as boy friend or finance in real life, who tends to be indecisive and bets his life totally on lucks. It's really a tragedy to his former fiancee, who always believes herself to be the only woman in a man's life, and is totally unaware of another woman's existence. It's so heart breaking to be abandoned on one's wedding day, and no one cares about your suffering because everyone feels so happy for the reunited couple.

Cusack and Beckinsale prove to be a nice pairing though it would have been nice to see them with more screen time together.  Also, if you look at the deleted scenes on the DVD, some of the best scenes, most natural feeling scenes are there. I'm not sure why they weren't chosen.  Anyway, the movie gets an added boost from the pairing of real life, longtime friends Cusack and Piven. They are truly hilarious together. As usual Levy is just a massive scene stealer and Corbett is very funny.  Shannon's talent is wasted in this movie and ill defined but she manages to make her mark. Moynahan is adequate in her role. I would have liked for Beckinsale to have had more screen time as well.  ****SPOILER  Her reaction to learning the wedding didn't take place was just priceless.

Speaking of Marquez, I am reminded of another post-modernist writer of our time, Milan Kundera, whose novel 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being' I read recently, in which Kundera makes quite a few serendipit-ish observations. According to him, the possibility of two strangers being drawn to each other increases if more and more 'birds of fortuity' keep 'alighting' on their shoulders - i.e. if by some freak occurrence of nature, they keep encountering each other in one way or the other. Kundera didn't use the word serendipity, but I think it comes fairly close to describing what he meant. So all in all, a nice movie - nice to see John Cusack in a kind of movie that's quite unlike the ones he usually does - Kate Beckinsale, looking as if she stepped right out of FTV/Vogue/etctetc...though quite nice. The usual romantic comedy elements assuredly in place - snow, ice rink, lovely cafes and a very lilting, mood-swaying soundtrack. All in all it left me with a half feel-good feeling, which probably would have been complete if I hadn't read the credits and read 'Pakistani Cab Driver' as Ajay Mehta. First of...being Indian, let me clarify - a Mehta, won't in a hundred years be a Pakistani. Our names are such that you can almost exactly tell from a person's name as to which part of the country that person came from and at a wider level, to which country he originally hailed from. Just as Americans would probably mind if they were described as Canadians or British, it is bothersome when so very often in books and movies the nationalities of people originating from this part of the world are just jumbled up, rather casually. Why describe the cab driver by his nationality anyway? Guessing from the fact that he was a cabbie working in New York, emigrated to the States, he is technically an American. There were only 2 cabbies in this film and they could well have just said, Cab Driver #1, Cab Driver #2. And if they wanted to mention the nationality, then pray, be considerate... I had, as expected succumbed to the floating, hazy-fuzzy feeling generated by the film, and then, like how they show in 'Ally McBeal', the soundtrack suddenly stops with a jarring noise, I was woken up when I read those credits and I felt a harsh voice saying Welcome to the real world... where it's so very easy to be nonchalant about someone's nationality just because they originate from the 'Third World'...You may think this is a rant about being politically correct, well, so be it. It's high time someone said something, especially when it involves movies.

Now, I have seen much worse, but there are much more romantic/funny comedies with John Cusack.This is a mediocre film at best. While the acting wasn't terrible, but not great, for a romantic comedy, there was little passion, little romance. There were many loose ends that don't show up or are not addressed. Unfortunately, the main characters do come off as complete cowards. They don't know themselves well enough to realize that they don't love the people they are engaged to. How do we know they aren't in love? By the utter lack of remorse both characters have for leaving their finances. I can think of few things more romantic than the continual escape from commitment that these two show.The movie doesn't even end with a wedding scene, more than likely both will get cold feet and drop each other like hot potatoes once a commitment is nearing. This movie is really about two people who can't commit to anything, unlike Cusack's previous characters, who were more than willing to make a deep commitment (Loyd in Say Anything, Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank, etc.).The greatest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twists turns, or anything of interest. When the movie ended, I felt like they had failed to include a climax to the story, which basically fits the whole movie boring. No suspense about whether the two will end up together, no joy when they do, no consequences to their actions.It is sad that people are so blind to the shoddiness of this movie, that they simply rebuke any criticism with 'Everyone is too Cynical!'. Criticism of this movie is not cynicism, simply unbiased examination. There are many other better romantic comedies, even ones with Grace Kelly, or Eva Marie Saint.If you think this movie is great, try these movies, you hearts will explode The Princess Bride, Say Anything, Grosse Pointe Blank, High Fidelity, Keeping the Faith, Charade, Rear Window, North by Northwest, or There's Something About Mary (which is a good examination of idealized romance vs. today's society).

But this has the interesting twist of two people actually consciously throwing the chance of a relationship into the hands of destiny.  The mechanics of this set up some fun and some tragedy as well - but perhaps you don't get as much of the passing of time and the sense of an itch that goes 'unscratched' in the intervening years as I'd have like to have seen.  I wonder if anything got cut ?  Both appear to have settled for 'Mr/Mrs Right when we catch up with them a few years later.

He's not overly-funny, serious, or pessimistic.  His character Jonathan is like a nice person you'd want to have a conversation with on any day of any week. His best friend is Dean Kansk, played by Jeremy Piven.  Dean is above all else a good and dependable friend, one that seems unfaillingly real.  I truly enjoyed Piven's performance... he seems molded to the role.Kate Beckinsale is Sara, a dreamer who doesn't really know what she wants. I've met women like this, and although I found her character to be under-played and under-acted, it might be because I really dont like Beckinsale much to begin with.  Her best friend Eve (Molly Shannon) is the female counter-part to Dean.  In my opinion, this is Molly's best performance.  She plays Eve as a realistic charming and caring friend. Her little quirks are so well timed and appear in such restraint that it was a joy to see her act.  Shannon really blew me away here.Levy and both lead characters' fiance/fiancee are all done in surprisingly good taste, not what one would expect out of hollywood (where characters are far too over-acted and end up being extreme in all aspects, even when temperance might be called for).  I don't really hold this film's plot/storyline against it.  It IS a romantic comedy, and what romantic-comedy isn't predictable?  The only thing I didn't really like was that through-out most of the movie, the lead actor and actress were not in each other's company/vicinity.

Here Cusack takes a turn and he's rather bad at it -- not that he's a bad actor, see High Fidelity for a really entertaining movie.  But here, he's out of his element, and the movie suffers badly because the main component, the relationship between he and Sarah (played by Kate Beckinsdale, who's wonderful to look at but not much more) is strained and there's no chemistry.  Look up Bringing Up Baby with Grant and Hepburn for definitive chemistry -- hard to define, but so important.  Still the movie is not without it's charms -- Eugene Levy is remarkably funny as a surly department store clerk; and Jeremy Priven is, as always, very funny in an effortless way.  Unfortunately, the positives are brought to task by certain negatives -- why does Molly Shannon get work?  She's uniformly dreadful and bone numbingly unfunny in everything she does and this is no exception.  She really ought to be selling houses in Encino or something where her bad timing and poor diction could have some use. The movie, overall, seems like an attempt to capture some of the magic of Sleepless In Seattle, even down to the Louis Armstrong tunes.  But it fails in that regard.  The chance meetings and certain plot elements do work, and I appreciate some of the writing that went into this -- here's a plot spoiler, perhaps the only moment in the movie that i really thought original, so if anyone is actually reading this, I'd skip to the next paragraph At their initial meeting, Sarah decides to write her name in a book, Love in the Time of Cholera (not my favorite, but who cares?).  At the time of his wedding to Bridget Moynahan, who's forced smile is extremely annoying, Cusack's character has given up his search for his lost love when his wedding gift from his bride to be, is, of course, the very book Sarah wrote her name in.  It's actually a touching moment -- and has actual irony, not the fake cynical stuff that passes as irony, but the real thing. This is not a great movie, not even very good, but there are elements that make you smile, and though predictble, I actually wanted to know how it ended, how the foregone conclusion actually happens.  Unfortunately, they kind of blow the end -- it really doesn't work.  I can understand all the negative comments, and agree with most of them; still, in the right mood, this might be a good couples flick to take in on a rainy saturday night -- when Arnie or Sly or Bruce won't do.

Maybe it's just wishful thinking but I would love it if someone like Beckinsale came into my life through fate.  She seems to have the ideal combination of pretty, funny, and smart.  Too bad she's famous!  Jeremy Piven, as with in Grosse Pointe Blank, makes the ideal best friend.  It is tough to decide whether he has the funniest lines or if Eugene Levy does.  The other two female leads work well also.  Even though I don't particularly like Molly Shannon (think Superstar) She is funny in this movie.  Bridget Moynahan was a great pick to play John's fiance, because she would have been a good partner for his character if not for fates introduction of the two leads. She also showed a great range against the previous character of the tough bitch in Coyote Ugly (I liked her that way).  The only character that I didn't particularly like was John Corbett's character.  I don't think he was supposed to be completely, but he seemed self centered instead of being somewhat likeable.

One night Jon and Sara meet while both wanting to buy a pair of gloves at Bloomingdales, but what a same there is only one pair left. Jon instantly falls for Sara but they are both in relationships at the moment. Sara, being a person who believes everything that happens, happens out of fate, assures Jon that if they were meant to be they would meet again. Well they do meet again but that's not enough for good ol' Sara, so she gets Jon to write his name and number on a five dollar bill and spends it, saying that if that bill gets back to her, it was fate that brought them together. She does something similar in writing her name in a book then selling it to a used book store the next day, telling Jon that if he finds the book it was fate. Years pass and they are both engaged to a partner that is like the Godfather Part 2 (see the movie), but are both still thinking of each other and so the search begins. I don't see how film makers expected us to feel sorry for two characters who spend most of the film wallowing in their own stupid actions. The only person I felt the least bit of sorrow for was Jon's girlfriend who has to be hurt like this so he can fulfill some stupid fantasy. What is a taken man doing out hitting on girls during the Christmas season for anyway? Yet I have learned something from viewing this film. I've learned that one, maybe even two ironic happenings could be fate, possibly destiney but a movie filled with them is just stupidity. On top of all that the script tries so hard to be smart, you will have the whole thing figured out within the first fifteen minutes and maybe someone should have told director Peter Chelsom that this isn't a thriller and the scenes in which his camera work seems to be trying to create tension are completly out of context. They always say that the first date is the best and the rest is downhill from there. I couldn't describe this film any better. With a promising start things slowly turn from a touching love story to a jumble of madness that is not in the least bit believable or romantic, in fact you will probably feel like you are watching the same scene over and over again, just with different circumstances surrounding it. But never fear by the time the last ten minutes roll around we have kicked back into touching love story mode. Just to bad that everything that followed was so dumb that all you will care about is for this movie to end right this moment. John Cusack is really milking the success of Pushing Tin and High Fidelity but this is a huge step backwards for him and Kate Beckinsale is also a very talented actress, but she really goes nowhere fast, which isn't really suprising considering she wasn't given much to work with in the first place. The only highlight of the film is Eugene Levy who is hilarious and steals every scene as a Bloomingdale's salesman who helps Jon try to find Sara, just to bad he wasn't in the whole movie maybe it would have been a lot better that way. So was it fate? I don't think so after about an hour I was convinced that Jon and Sara were just two ordinary people with extremly large amounts of luck. Actually that's not entirly true. After an hour I wasn't caring about anything but seeing the ending credits role. Sorry girls, maybe next time.

For an hour and a half or so we can feel with the characters ups and downs and, hopefully an up before the film ends.This movie does just that in the tradition of modern romantic classics like Sleepless In Seattle and You've Got Mail, there is the build-up as we see the characters come in contact, become seemingly impossibly seperated and make their way back together again.The book that Sara signs her name in, Love In The Time Of Cholera, is by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and it's theme, which parallels the movie, is about lost love over time, distance and circumstance.The cameos were great to see, Buck Henry, Molly Shannon, Eugene Levy and more were all bright spots in scenes they were in.It must be realized when watching a movie like this that there is no time to show the resolution of every loose end as far as prior and current relationships. It is assumed that as the plot has managed to work things out, that situation has been or will be worked out in itself. The basic point of the movie is that there is one person fated for us, to settle for anyone else when there is a chance of being with the soul-mate is to cheat everyone involved. To be rejected before marrying is far to be preferred to living years in an unhappy marriageRecommended, particularly as a Christmas treat.

I find it irritating that both main characters go as far as planning their weddings with someone else, were ready to hurt their partner's feelings (money doesn't seem to be a problem either  hello, I'm sure getting married at the Astoria doesn't come cheap).

Firstly, I find it hard to believe that either of these characters loved each other.  In the former part of the movie Kate and John, let's call them by their real names since their characters are both airheads, decide to let fate bring them back to each other. Well in all honesty one should be smart enough to know, if one believes in fate, that it is fate that initially brought them together in the first place. So why the whole goose chase? Why didn't Jonathan ask Sara out then and there? Probably because he was too chicken. I think this movie's whole purpose was to contradict the popular saying `opportunity only knocks once.'

Specifically for the 'old spice' joke, which was hilarious.Unfortunately 'Serendipity' isn't as cool, or as original as the trailer shows. It is a movie made for girls, since the story is the ultimate girl fantasy to meet the man of their lives and send him away, so that destiny will bring him back, forever!John Cusack plays this fairly regular guy, who meets a girl played by Kate Beckinsdale. The girl is crazy, totally insane. I mean, there is no way this psychotic person be a psychiatrist! She believes in all the usual girly stuff stars, destiny, feeling that she is the center of the universe, etc. So when Jon loses her phone number, she believes that this is a sign and because of her eccentricity they have to undergo a number of love games that should prove if they are really meant for each other.Now one small note would anyone ever let this paranoid girl get away with all the crazy stuff she does? Imagine living a life with her. Even when her poor fiance gives her an engagement ring that doesn't fit well, she takes it as a sign from destiny! A bit too much I believe.The bad thing about the movie is that it is not crazy enough, to make all these incidents seem more believable. Instead of being a Farreli movie, it becomes this Meg Ryan type of movie, that will drive most men insane, while it will make all girls daydream. John Cusack never played in 'cute' movies, all of his movies included funny 'immature' moments that gave them enough comedic edge. 'Serendipity' on the other hand is too nice, made to please girls (no stupid 'guy' humor here).To sum up, I feel that 'Serendipity' would look much better if it had Hugh Grant instead of John Cusack. The director and the female protagonist are British, so why not make 'em all British? Plus, Hugh seams a lot more patient than John and this girl really needs someone with a lot of patience. I am a John Cusack fan and I feel sorry that he was wasted here.SPOILER What ever happened to their fiances?

I further can't believe I'm wasting another 15 writing about it.  But once again, I'm so incredibly stupified by the positive comments a film has received, I feel obliged to point out what I feel is obvious.Serendipity is one of the worst films ever made.  Pass whatever you're smoking this way if you feel otherwise.  What was Jon Cusack thinking? Beckinsale, hot on the heels of her bad performance in Pearl Harbor, leaves no doubt that she can't act a lick.This film is so chock full of cliches and ridiculous happenings, it's pointless to point them out, since they happen in EVERY scene.  Yes, I get the concept of serendipity.  Leave everything to chance.  OK, once again, an example of a concept that actually could be taken somewhere if someone had put an ounce of intellegence into the script.  Needless to say, that doesn't happen here.  I made a permanent dent in my couch watching this film because as the scenes rolled before my eyes, I cringed further and further back.  Here's a hint to the aspiring scriptwriters  If you're thinking of using a concept that is completely absurd, BE SUBTLE.  That's the only way a film like this is going to work.  Make the characters, and therefore the audience, use their heads a little bit.  Don't smack us in the face repeatedly with this kind of crap.Needless to say, if I met some girl and she did the things that Beckinsale does when her and Cusack first meet, I'd tell her she needed to run, not walk, to Bellevue and check herself in.  The film pretty much fails at this early point and gets worse and worse.  Remarkably, a film like this can rise above it's script and actually be somewhat decent.  Most of them are romantic comedies with absurd circumstances where the actors are so likeable and add such depth, that they pull themselves away from an otherwise bad script.  Cusack and Beckinsale seemed to enjoy wallowing in the muck of this script.  As did the supporting cast, who usually are good for a few laughs in a film like this.  Jeremy Piven, debuting a new rag on his head, and Molly Stick to SNL (everyone's bad there) Shannon are as bad as the leads.I hate to be so harsh, but if you think this is a good movie, you'd probably enjoy a pet rock or an engagement ring from Wal-Mart.

I didn't see the others for comparison.  When he is done, you want go over to your best friend, smack him in the head, and ask him why he's so lame.  He just exudes passion.Then there is John Cusack's subtle but effective performance.  His built up haggardness during the chase is so good, you hardly notice it.  By the time he has received the book and is in the cab with Piven, his anxiety and distress are absolutely palpable.And Kate Beckinsdale really enraptures you.  The movie doesn't work without her because she is that adorable that you could see someone chasing her for years.  That's not easy.  We've all seen stars screw that up in other Romantic Comedies.  Had Julia Roberts not half assed her way thru Notting Hill, it would have been even better.  It's too bad for Kate, I think had it not for Amelie's release in the same timeframe in the US, she may have been heralded as this year's new ingenue.Plot is fun, but does require some dispending of disbelief, but who goes to a RC for pure reality.

Cusack, a New Yorker, has a random encounter with Kate Beckinsale, English charmer. They spend a day together, without knowing each other's name.  Rather than act on their obvious interest in each other, they agree (more her than him, because it's a ROMANTIC comedy) to let fate work.  Several years later, both of them are preparing to marry... other people.  You will enjoy Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon in the best friend roles, trying to beat common sense into the picture, then give up ultimately in the name of true love. Add John Corbett and Eugene Levy in very funny supporting roles, and the fact that the movie uses music by Nick Drake (one of my favorites, another review another time), and I was sold.  I am usually no fan of those too-awkward moments that seem contrived in this genre, but even those moments in this film keep you grinning (the actress playing Sarah's sister borrowing the house comes to mind, and keep it in mind).

As they simultaneously grab the same pair of gloves, their eyes meet and romance seems but a heartbeat away. Unfortunately, they both have partners and since Sara Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) believes in fate, they make an unusual pact. She writes her name and phone number on the flyleaf of a second&#150;hand book and he writes his on a five dollar note. Both of these are sent off into circulation. If either finds the book or the money again, their love was meant to be. In true Hollywood fashion, they leave it all up to &#145;serendipity' - a happy discovery made by accident.This highly unlikely idea for a movie just barely holds together. It's mainly due to the charm and likeability of the two main actors that the movie isn't a complete disaster. Following the initial implausible meeting, the movie quickly spirals off into a bizarre parallel universe when no&#150;one acts normally or logically. There are simply too many impossible coincidences even for a light romantic comedy like Serendipity. The frustrated lovers constantly miss each other by seconds in their search for each other while, amazingly, people, objects and events are located or happen in the nick of time. The two of them have so much luck, they should buy lottery tickets since it's obvious that they have been blessed with supernatural powers.Luckily, John Cusack (Grosse Point Blank, Pushing Tin, High Fidelity) is a classy actor as is Kate Beckinsale (Pearl Harbour). However, even they struggle to make sense of this strange world where people simply don't act at all like normal people.However, there are moments when the otherwise predictable plot almost works. The scenes with the department store clothes salesman (Eugene Levy from American Pie) and loyal best friend (Jeremy Piven from Rush Hour 2) are spontaneous and very funny. Although you may feel like leaving early, it's worth sitting through it all just to enjoy these scenes. These supporting actors very nearly steal the movie.Directed by Peter Chelsom (The Mighty, Funny Bones) Serendipity is like being hit over the head with a big sack of fairy floss for a couple of hours. Rated 3/10.

At that moment, they knew that Jonathan would find Sara.The ending was absolutely breathtaking.

Let's try. Our tale starts amid the Christmas rush of New York City some years ago, I say tale rather than story, because the film's running fatalistic attitude and acceptable coincidences give it a fairy-tale feel. The Louis Armstrong song belted over the opening credits is a shameless reminder of the type of film you are watching. In the opening scene Cusak's Jonathon Trager, does this film's equivalent to two peopl reaching over for something and bumping heads, when he reaches for a pair of black gloves only to feel them pulling back. On the other end of the cashmere he sees Kate Beckinsale's character, and she sees him. I would rather not reveal her character name because she chooses not to reveal it to Trager throughout the in-the-past prologue and when she finally does say her name, it is that much sweeter. (close your eyes watching the trailer because you'll see it written in a book). The pair of gloves become the happy accident, the serendipitous moment that propels Trager and the mystery woman into a wonderful night together.Trager wants a phone number, a name, Ms. Mystery wants to leave the chances of their meeting again in the capable hands of fate. A five dollar bill, with Trager's name and number on it, is put in circulation, and Ms. Mystery writes her name in a book and says she will sell it to a used book store the next day. If eventually either of these things finds their way back into either of their hands, they were meant to be. Seven Years later. Both of them are engaged... to different people, on different sides of the country, and still neither of them can help checking used book stores or the backs of five spots. An interesting, and possibly dangerous way to tell the story, is in the fact that for the majority of the film, the two characters we are rooting for, are nowhere near each other; a storyline that worked well in the genre smash Sleepless In Seattle. We are asked to still believe these two people are perfect for each other based solely on the charisma and compatibility they shared on one night, years earlier. Director Peter Chelsom pulls it off without hitch. One of the hardest things to get past, are the significant others. In any film, when a character is marrying someone we know they shouldn't, there is a wisely apparent character trait the fiance´ has that solidifies the fact that they should not be with our hero/heroine. In Beckinsale's beau, that trait is apparent, and possibly the funniest gag in the film. John Corbett plays Lars, a Yanni-esque, weird-mideastern instrument playing musician. He is likeable, but his putting his tour before their honeymoon registers unhappiness in Beckinsale's face, and makes it okay for us to want her to leave him in search of a figment of fate. On the other hand, Bridget Moynahan's Hallie, Trager's Hallie, may very well be perfect for him, and possibly for me as well, which makes pulling for Trager to leave her, quite difficult. Chelsom has said of Moynahan, that he wanted to cast someone anyone would love to marry. Rounding out the cast is Cusak's real-life best bud, Brother from another mother, Jeremy Piven, Saturday Night Live's Molly Shannon, and the always hilarious Eugene Levy. The film from the start asks you to at least consider the possibility that everyone has one someone out there meant for them, and if you allow yourself to believe it, if only for an hour and a half, then the stacks of coincidences will seems as they should... acts of fate doing everything they can to get two people together; and not as a sceenwriter's easy way around writer's block. Cusak plays the everyman's romantic man very well, trading quips with the equally endearing Piven.And Beckinsale need not beg anyone to fall in love with her here, her soft Brittish accent, and freckle-flecked appearance make her quite possibly the most beautiful thing on screen so far this year. Her performance is real, and winning, and a far cry from her less than stellar turn in this year's Pearl Harbor. This genre rarely, if ever leaves anything to chance, choosing rather to work away at women's (and some men's) tear ducts with a rehashing of the same proven formula. However, to their credit, perhaps makers of these films are just aware that we don't always need to have the envelope pushed with innovative art, sometimes we just need to know that there is someone out there for each of us, and that eventually, as is always the case in these films, we will find them. I have escaped this review without a personal play on the film's title.

However, if you are looking for more than that, or if you just make the mistake of looking too hard, you'll be disappointed.John Cusack -- who is definitely getting too old for these types of roles and looks it -- bumps into Kate Beckinsale at Bloomingdales.  (Can we say 'corporate sponsorship', children?  I thought you could!)  They spend a magical evening together until Beckinsale starts spewing New-Age nonsense about how to test Fate and so sets up the central conceit of the film.  I wonder if the screenwriters are also still single and looking all over New York for an obscure used book.Now, Beckinsale is simply heart-melting in this role, and Cusack is always good on screen, even if he's in a role he should have passed on.  The rest of the cast is equally capable; I was especially surprised by Molly Shannon, who manages to act as though she was raised among humans for the first time in her movie career.  I liked Jeremy Piven in a role similar to the one he had in 'Family Man'.  (How many remember the first film he and Cusack did together as featured performers -- 'One Crazy Summer'?)  The cinematography was very well done and the music fit the mood, although if I see ONE more NY-romantic-comedy with a Louis Armstrong song, I'll scream. **SPOILER AHEAD**So, my problems with Serendipity boiled down to the screenplay.  Does every romantic comedy have to have two people dumping their fiancées -- one almost literally at the altar -- in order to achieve happiness?  I guess I wonder why I should give a damn about two people so self-involved that their previous commitments mean little or nothing to them, except in Cusack's case, where it is used just as a philsophical measuring stick (bird in the hand vs two in the bush).   And although Beckinsale's boyfriend is a goof, I actually liked Cusack's bride-to-be.  It seems needlessly mean-spirited, and even though we like Cusack's character, he really begins to look a lot more like a case of arrested development than a romantic protagonist.  Even his character in 'One Crazy Summer' seemed more mature than this.  Would a woman REALLY want a guy this allergic to keeping his commitments, always chasing after his whims?Anyway, that's probably more analysis than this films demands (or deserves).  Like I said, it's a pleasant bit of fluff, so if your expectations are properly set, 'Serendipity' will entertain you.  Just don't spend a lot of time thinking about it later.

Despite this, Serendipity is very entertaining, mainly due to the inspired casting.  John Cusack is typically endearing as the male lead & Beckinsale, sporting her own British accent for once, is charming & believable as the object of his desire.  One would find it even more ridiculous that these two have been harping over each other for 10 years (count 'em), even despite the fact that both are coincidentally to be married to their respective beaus at around the same time, if not for the appeal of the actors portraying them.The supporting cast lends a lot to the film's likeability - especially the always stellar Jeremy Piven as Cusack's sometimes overly supportive best pal.

After some flirting, and telling a lame story to a guy who also wants the glove, they hit it off, decide to have a cup of coffee, and end up having the best spontaneous date in the history of film (BUT THEY BOTH HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OTHER. too funny to me).  Sara believes that things are predestined, happen for a reason, but Jonathan's not buying it.  To prove that if it's meant to be, they should continue this, she has him write his name and number on a five dollar bill and promptly puts it out into the universe by buying some breath mints.  She writes her name and number in a book she just bought and will sell the next day to a bookstore.  If she finds the bill or he finds the book, it's meant to be.  To push their luck (as if this other scenario wasn't crazy enough) they get in separate elevators at the Waldorf Astoria and if they meet on the same floor, it's got to be fate they're together.  Well, they don't get off on the same floor (close though) and this gets the ball rolling to where we meet these characters years later, where they've moved on to other relationships, but still thinking about each other.  We find out how intertwined their lives really are and spend the rest of the picture seeing if fate will indeed bring them together.I liked the movie but didn't love it.  It's great acting, especially by Jeremy Piven as Cusack's best friend and Eugene Levy as an annoying, but still helpful, Bloomies clerk.  This movie tries to capture that whole Sleepless in Seattle old school romance thing, but it just doesn't have the magic of earlier romantic comedies.

The ironic near-meetings and close calls pile up, one after the other, to such an extent that one can't help but feel lost, bored, and disenchanted with the film when it finally comes to its predictable ending (guess what - they find each other!), but it comes to that point so slowly that the process is worth watching.  It's a good date movie, but it's nothing you haven't seen before.

In those venues, you will except a typical Hollywood romance piece, without much original thought. The plot and performances are so formulaic, that I was bored silly with the predictability.  John Cusack does his usual witty and sensitive guy bit that he basically mailed in.  Molly Shannon and Eugene Levy rehash characters from their improv days.  Kate Beckinsale is soooooooo sweet as to be hollow.  Some of the dialogue is funny, the saving grace of this otherwise cookie cutter effort.Amidst all the formula, there is also a terrible message of leaving a great relationship based on a feeling.  No character development on Cusack's role as to why he feels incomplete with his girlfriend/fiancee.  It's a pithy attempt to suggest that he is inspired by love.  He's just an idiot.My wife made me see this movie in exchange for the opportunity to see Training Days.

"},{"Title":"Life of Passion","Date":"7 October 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":" Serendipity is a magical romantic comedy. It is a great movie. Director Peter Chelsom crafts a modern fable about a world given by design where two people are each others' soul mate. In this case it is Jonathan (John Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckensale) who contest over a pair of gloves while Christmas shopping for each other's sweetheart seven years ago in New York's Bloomingdales. Jon and Sara have the magical and wonderful evening of their lives. According to Sara it is serendipity which she defines as a fortunate accident. She suggests that if they are indeed soul mates, they will meet again-- it's fate. So Jon agrees to write his phone number on a five dollar bill that she spends at a newsstand. Sara writes her name and number in a copy of Love in the Time of Cholera which she will sell to a used bookstore. The very romantic setting in the hands of writer Marc Klein, takes some unexpected and funny turns. Klein keeps what could have been very predictable so very charming and satisfying. We catch up with Jon and Sara present day. Jon is a successful ESPN producer engaged to be married to a lovely woman, Halley (played by Bridget Moynahan). Sara is a counselor in the Bay Area also engaged to Lars (John Corbett), a New Age musical star-- really. Halley is great, though she is not Sara. So Jon enlists the aid of his Best Man, Dean (Jeremy Piven) to find Sara three days before he is to marry. Sara also begins her quest to find Jon with her cynical pal, Eve (Molly Shannon). Cusack and Beckensale have amazing chemistry that sustains the separation of the storyline. John Cusack is funny, vulnerable, and so very human. When he and Piven force Eugene Levy's Bloomingdales clerk to track down Sara, they could have been considered stalkers, instead it is comical desperation. This is a tribute to a talented cast. Kate Beckensale's talents are on display here. She is believable as the woman who gives into serendipity-- she has faith. This creates an inspired quest-- finding their soul mate. What distinguishes the movie is when Dean, a New York Times Obituary Writer, acknowledges Jonathan when he tells him that the ancient Greeks did not write obituaries, but asked rather Did he live with passion? Sure, searching for your soul mate is ridiculous or maybe considered being a jackass. Though at the cost of living a life with passion, like the characters, Jonathan and Sara, we can say So what. Serendipity offers a wonderful journey for living a life with passion.

However, why would we want him to?  Serendipity was an enjoyable movie showcasing Cusack's talent for playing the same character he's played since Better off Dead.  Jeremy Piven, Cusack's best friend since age 9, give a supurb performance as, you guessed it, Cusack's best friend. The weakest part of this movie was by far the plot.  This was the single most contrived plot EVER, but somehow it left the audience praying that this is the scene where they finally meet each other again.  Scenes are left unexplained, characters' relationships are random and chaotic (ie. Did Eve and Halley get it on in college?) yet the movie itself is enjoyable as hell.But don't take my word for it.    "},{"Title":"A Good Dessert Movie","Date":"7 October 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  Ok. Let's make one thing clear from the top this movie is like lemon meringue--tasty but certainly not nutritious or filling. But then again, it's not supposed to be. Those in search of a well-crafted dramatic theatrical feast, should crank up their surround-sound systems and rent `The Matrix.'That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie-plot-holes and all. I find it easier to accept such holes in romantic comedies than in dramas like `Don't Say A Word,' a film with enough perforations to make it the culinary equivalent of Swiss Cheese.A number of things worked well in this film, and yes, a number did not. In the beginning of the movie as the plot is being set up, Beckinsale's Sara is a bit quick to shove the wheels of fate into motion. Missing is any substantial display of guilt, particularly since she and Cusack's Jonathan had already crossed the line by going out for dessert even though both were in committed relationships. The book, the $5 bill, and the gloves were all obvious plot devices, destined to return later in the third reel. However, the elevator sequence was just plain silly, seemingly stolen from a second-class sit-com. Still, if Cusack and Beckinsale had followed their hearts (and logic), the movie would have ended within the first ten minutes.Other reviewers have complained about the seeming lack of chemistry between the main characters. However, the inherent nature of the plot handicaps them because they spend the bulk of the movie APART. Their scenes together, the opening sequence and then the closing moments, are just that-moments. There's more on-screen bonding between Cusack and his best friend, played by Jeremy Piven, than between our star-crossed lovers. But that doesn't matter. `Sleepless in Seattle' and `You've Got Mail' also suffered from this trap, and it's difficult to resolve when the plot keeps (or pushes) the leads apart.I also had some difficulty with (1) the amount of time each of them were able to take off from work, (2) the absence of any indication that these two people have a life outside of their soul mate pursuit, (something nicely written into Hugh Grant's character in `Notting Hill,'), (3) the lack of chemistry between Cusack and Bridget Moynahan, his fiancé, (4) Jon Corbett's Kenny G-like character (is this a New Age stereotype or just a week parody?) (5) Eugene Levy's flagrant disregard for invasion of privacy issues (The commission from Cusack's purchases wouldn't have even covered the retainer for Levy's attorney), (6) why oh why New York again? There are a dozen other cities aching to provide a backdrop for a romantic comedy, and (7) the movie could have ended quite satisfyingly on the ice skating rink without resorting to more of Levy's Bloomingdale shtick.In spite of those nitpicks, I very much enjoyed the romantic escapism of the film. I was so relieved that the plot did not require the lovers to sleep together in order to ignite their passion. In addition, I found the writing to be witty and funny without being obnoxiously cute, and without hurling unrealistic `people never really say that' sit-com one-liners at us.If it seems as if this review contains more nitpicks than accolades, it is only because it is easy to quantify the miscues by applying logic to a plot. But suspension of disbelief in this genre requires a bit more tolerance than in `real-life dramas.' Romantic comedies don't attempt to imitate life. They attempt to capitalize on our hopes, our fantasies, our need to believe in love and being loved. Real life seldom contains all of those ingredients-at least in sufficient quantities to sustain a 90 minute movie or make a 5-course meal. Taken for what this film sets out to accomplish, it is as satisfying as any dessert should be.

So, although he doesn't chart new waters here playing a romantic fool ... he glides through this movie and makes it work due to his charm. Which is nicely offset by Kate Beckinsale who plays a demure British girl with a few quirks. There are definitely better picks to play the female lead, but Beckinsale does leave an impression.Boy meets Girl, boy loses girl, boy regains girl. The movie is formulatic, no doubt, but it executes the formula very well. Also, the movie will throw you a few curves because it plays around with the formula a bit. As with any date movie, the secondary leads are essential. Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon do not disappoint. Most of the comedy bits are given to them, and they do very well.

That may be because its forgotten some of the cardinal rules of script writing.  One such rule is that stories without strong characters and credible subplots tend to bog way down if the main story line is weak.  And a storyline can't get much weaker than this tale of a couple who are destined to be together.John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale meet cute in that temple of consumerism, Bloomingdale's,where both are Christmas shopping.  They spend a magical few hours together, including a spin around the ice rink in Central Park, and he immediately decides they should both dump their significant others and be blissfully happy together.  Of course, in an effort to give this thin story a little suspense, they don't.They both go back to the other people in their lives and spend the rest of the movie regretting that.They also spend the rest of the movie searching for one another. Much of the search lacks credibility. (A Bloomningdale's salesman help's Cusack get Beckingsale's home address from store records, never worrying for a second that he might be a stalker or that the store might get sued). But the real problem is, the hunt just isn't interesting.  In fact, virtually nothing in this movie is interesting.Cusack and Beckinsale have professions, but luckily, neither has to spend any time following them. They have friends, but they're there essentially to carry their luggage as they conduct this nationwide search for a person they spent a few hours with.They have no other vestages of a real life, either.  This movie seems designed for an egocentric, me generation audience that thinks the search for personal love,or at least a mate, is so important it is the only thing worth focusing on.  You can only wonder what happens if these two find each other, because if they are no more interesting than they seem to be during the search, they'll bore each other to death within weeks.John Cusack is okay in his role, but he's given so little to do that he seems totally wasted here. Beckinsale is certainly one of the most beautiful girls in movies today, a real movie star/movie star.  And she can act.  She does a good job here with what little that she's given, coming off better than she did in Pearl Harbor.  But the girl who was beguiling in Last Days of Disco and highly believeable in her British work, never gets a chance to do much here.I guess it takes a decent script to give actors a chance to shine and this sure wasn't it.

It is not the usual sarcastic comedy or love wins over tremendous odds film that we have come to expect when we go to the movies.  Its about two people meeting by chance, at one of the most unromantic moments of the year. Both are Christmas shopping in a huge department store a few days before the big event.  Both are stressed.  Both are in a hurry.  Both want the same pair of black cashmere gloves.  Both stop for a moment and recognize something intangible in that moment.  Cusack's character (Jonathan Trager, a golf producer for ESPN) the more practical and older of the two takes the lead.  Beckingsale's character (Sara Thomas) throws caution to the wind and follows for a delightful evening of flirting with fate.  Both lead actors are excellent in their roles.  The supporting cast is wonderful, except for Trager's fiancé, Hally, who looks uncomfortable with him (no wonder he gives up on her.)What I found very interesting was how the two main characters eventually switch beliefs with Trager seeing signs that it was not meant to be and Thomas giving into practicality.  Their friends also change with them borrowing their fears, hopes, and dreams. Jeremy Piven is excellent in his scenes with Cusack.  There are quite a few funny scenes and a number of feel good ones, some light tension and a wonderful culmination.  Please don't forget this is a modern faerie tale.The important thing is this film left me feeling good, at a time when I really needed to feel good, about life and love and people in general.  The entire cast and crew should be proud of the fact that they are delivering a message of love and life and what it can be, if we just believe.It's not perfect but I'd go again just for the serendipitous feeling... ...and they lived happily ever after.Denise "},{"Title":"Delightful, refreshing","Date":"1 October 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance","Review":"  Charming, intelligent romantic comedy which makes a good deal of progress towards bringing back the comedy in this genre.

Although I'm not a fan of romantic comedies since they mainly appeal to females, SERENDIPITY is a magical little film with a universal story and a great cast. The two stars are excellent together despite their intentional few scenes together.My one reason for seeing this film was for the starring role of Kate Beckinsale, so I'll devote this paragraph solely on her performance and presence in the film. Kate is perfectly cast as the English girl Sara Thomas, who believes in destiny and how it can alter people's lives. Kate brings wit, charm, and warmth into a role that could've looked awkward and artificial in the hands of a less talented actress. Her scenes with John Cusack are very engaging and she portrays this gentleness with utter believability. Although she frequently applies a faultless American accent in most of her Hollywood films, Kate's fresh-faced, English rose looks match her genuine and refined English accent perfectly in this film. Not only do I find Kate a gorgeous actress, I think she is one of the most versatile and consummate actresses in contemporary film. Hopefully she will continue to play similar roles that bring smiles across the faces of many audiences and critics.Equally effective is John Cusack as the shy, slightly neurotic young man who Sara loves, conveying a sense of vulnerability and strong emotional feeling that many male viewers can easily relate to (including me). Special mention goes to Eugene Levy for his scene-stealing comic relief role as a Bloomingdale department store salesman.Although the story may be slight and somewhat predictable, the cast makes SERENDIPITY a beautiful, emotional film that's worth watching. The film may not be realistic&#151;since not all timid American guys have English girlfriends that look like Kate Beckinsale&#151;but it's a very enjoyable film to share with someone you love. For similar and more obscure films of this type, I wholeheartedly recommend the delightful I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING! (1945), a favorite classic British film of mine starring Wendy Hiller and Roger Livesey as an unlikely pair of lovers, and the poignant WATERLOO BRIDGE (1940), starring Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor as the star-crossed lovers who first meet in the titular setting.

They hit it off and spend the evening ice-skating and chatting. However each has a significant other and, although everything seems natural and right they both agree to leave it to fate to see if they meet again. So Jonathan writes his number on a note that he then spends, while Sara writes her number inside a book that she later sells into the used book circuit. However as time passes both get fed up waiting for fate and try to locate the other.You really need to be an incurable romantic to be able to buy into this film because it has fate, love at first sight and so on, all as key plot devices. If these don't work for you as a key part of the narrative then you should probably just avoid this stuff because there isn't really anything else here that will help you out. The opening bonding between Jonathan and Sara is sweet but there is nothing there that made me believe that they were meant to be together or that I should be right with them in support as they strip their lives down in the search for one another. Given I wasn't sold into the central romance then all that was left was a very, very occasionally amusing film &#150; but certainly not funny or interesting enough to be worth seeing unless you get into the wider tone.The cast try hard but none of them can convince &#150; instead they all focus on acting caught up in fate and unsure of where they are going. It is a gamble that, for the target audience, will pay off. Cusack has enough about him to get by, but, while she is stunning, Beckinsale is not that good. Support from Piven, Moynahan and others is all well and good but to be honest they could have given career-defining performances and I still wouldn't have got into the plot.Overall then a genre film after a very specific target audience of dreamers who believe and want to believe in love, destiny and the power thereof. They will find the plot charming but if you don't buy into these ideas as major plot devices then you will be left out and, for even the slightly cynical, there isn't a great deal else to justify watching this.

She writes her name in a used book, donates it, and tells Jonathan that if their fate is to meet up again, he will come upon the book. He also writes his name and number on a $5bill, she goes over to a news stand to buy something, putting the bill back into circulation. If it comes back to her, fate meant for them to meet.I didn't particularly like the movie's premise. It seems very silly to me that a person would use a 'fate' excuse if they really were attracted to another, which Sara clearly was. But I watched it anyway, because I enjoy both Cusack and Beckinsale. This is one of these quickly forgettable movies, but has some entertainment value.SPOILERS. Sara goes back to the west coast, Jonathan stays in NYC. They don't meet up. Several years later she is engaged, and he is also engaged. But the prospects of their spending their lives with these persons gets them to thinking about their missed meeting. Sara travels to NYC, she decides her fiancée is not really the one for her, and Jonathan comes to a similar realization.

The movie is about Johnatan and Sarah who meet and feel something between them, but Saraha has unusual character. She believes that it is written for people to be together, so she wants destiny to show if she is ready for such a relationship and in fact Johnatan presses the same elevator number as Sarah, but a father and a boy stops the elevator and Johnatan doesn't come in time at the floor where Sarah is. Then things go wrong and Johnatan wants to meet Sarah again.This is the story of Serendipity. After these first 15 minutes I believe the movie becomes more comedy like with some really, really fresh lines and even hilarious moments and then back to a romantic story. The balance is kept and this helps the movie to succeed in what is supposed to be. Cuask and Beckinsale are great. I like both of them and both of them in a romantic story looks great. As I said there were indeed hidden messages although some clichés like what is love indeed what is the price of it or is it priceless, is it worth to do so many things just to find a strange girl which might not fall in love with you after all. It depends on characters. The movie is realistic most of all and it's much above most recent romance movies.And of course it might be considered simply as enjoyable and relivable, but if you are in mood, I suggest think more of what the movie is really trying to say.

That neither Jonathan nor Sara seemed even remotely concerned for the feelings of their respective fiancés' was appalling. Then to underscore this callousness even further, Jonathan's best friend considers him to be some kind of hero for chasing after his dreams. Remarkable!

He and his friend arrived at a house which I believed to be where Kate was living in? His friend peeped into the house and saw a couple making love. He then tried to restrain John Cusack from seeing what was going on inside. Were they still in NYC or in England? The woman inside the window appeared to be Kate Beckinsale. Was it someone else? If it was her, why did he not ask her about the guy when they finally met at the ice rink at the end of the movie? Since he called off his wedding because of her, you would have thought he would have asked about her other lover. If it was his fiancée, then why didn't he charge into the house and confront her? I think that was the only hole in the movie that left me a little confused. Overall, it was a nice romantic comedy, but it seemed a bit too short in duration to be able to develop the characters and story line.**UPDATE** I read some earlier comments about the movie and I think I got the answer to my earlier question.

Though 'Town and Country' (2001) was a critical disaster.Personally, I'll see anything with John Cusack in it. He is not necessarily a great actor in terms of range, but his appeal in terms of likability always draws me to his films. Even a seemingly sappy romance like this one in 'Serendipity'! Kate Beckinsale has never really done much for me, until recently when I saw her in Scorsese's 'The Aviator' (2004). Until that film, I didn't really think much of her as an actress, and 'Serendipity' was one of the earlier films that didn't sell me on her. Basically, this romantic-comedy is the usual predictable stuff that Hollywood churns out.It's all about what ifs? and destiny! Sudden chance meets, and finding that true love. Instead of not knowing who the other person is; ala a theme explored in 'You've Got Mail' (1998) and 'Sleepless in Seattle' (1993), where Hanks isn't aware of Ryan being the other mystery internet woman in one film, or Hanks has to search for that elusive voice of Ryan's in another film! Here in 'Serendipity'- Cusack meets Beckinsdale, thinks she's the one, but she's not so sure, so she writes her number on the back of her book, and if destiny works for them, then they'll be together. Very sentimental indeed! Understandably, Cusack is none too happy about this, but regardless 10 years (or something like that) goes by, and each of them are living separate lives in different countries too.So, both parties realise that they are curious about the other, and even still think about the other. Kate realises that she could have made a mistake not taking a chance in Cusack all those years ago, and Cusack starts to find signs that symbolise that night with her all those years ago! The rest of the movie spends them indecisively discussing with pals about what to do and what does everything mean, and has the whole they just missed each other gimmick, as they both go look for each other! And of course, destiny plays a part too! Feels like old ground covered before in films of this ilk. 'Serendipity' is watch-able, but it never really takes off for me! It just felt so rehashed, and cliché, and that I've seen this before somewhere! Rent the similar themed Nicolas Cage/Tea Leoni film in 'The Family Man' (2000) instead (which also has Jeremy Piven in it), or if you're like me, and feel you have to see every John Cusack film under the sun- then this won't make want to gauge your eyes out!

Were they thinking at all?  It's as if they churned it out of the formula romantic comedy mill, then decided it was still too fresh and original, so they ran it through again.  Serendipity throws every known romantic comedy cliche at the audience with dizzying speed, finally concluding with the unavoidable happy kissing scene.  This movie is intended for hopeless romantics (like the woman who dragged me to it) who will happily sit through an hour and a half of pointless nonsense for the happy kissing scene at the end.  And did I mention the happy kissing scene?  The trailer had an intriguingly romantic premise--two people supposedly destined by fate to be together--which could have been made into an intriguing romantic movie.  Looking back, I can see that this high concept was merely intended to lure hopeless romantics into the movie.  Instead of living up the promise of this idea, Serendipity turned out to be just another cookie-cutter romantic comedy, and then some. The biggest, largest, hugest mistake the movie made was to make Cusack and Beckinsale engaged to supporting characters.  The movie would have been much, much more palatable if they had been lonely and searching.  The central part of the movie involves Cusack and Beckinsale walking, driving, and flying around in a desperate race against time to find each other before they have to get married to somebody else.  This race against time is ultimately meaningless, because Cusack jilts his girlfriend at the altar--off screen!  Cusack's girlfriend and Beckinsale's boyfriend simply disappear from the movie!  They must have been heartbroken, but since they are the obligatory supporting characters who have to be discarded so that the romantic leads can get together, their feelings don't matter and the audience shouldn't be burdened with them.  It's an outrageous cheat on the part of the writers.  And by the time Cusack finds the copy of Love in the Time of Cholera with Beckinsale's name and phone number in it, and Beckinsale finds the five-dollar bill with Cusack's name and phone number on it, they have already spent half the movie trying to find each other, so what's the point?  At the end of the movie, after Cusack lies down on a skating rink and lets snowflakes fall into his mouth in a scene with no apparent purpose except to showcase his cuteness, Beckinsale finds him, they tell each other their names to be sure they have the right person, and then they immediately start kissing, even though they spent only one evening together five years ago.  After all, now that they've found each other, there's no point in continuing the movie; the requirements of the formula have been satisfied.  Please, for the sake of humanity, if you want to watch Serendipity, watch the one with the pink sea serpent.

The exact same situations and thoughts are repeatedly presented to you over and over again.  It seems long and drawn out, with the situations that were designed to create suspense being overly predictable, silly and annoying.I have only seen three John Cusak movies (this one, America's Sweethearts and High Fidelity), and I'm about to conclude that Cusak is a mediocre actor, at best.  His character, Jonathan Trager, is barely likeable in this movie.  He is insensitive and uncaring towards his current girlfriend, he comes off as creepy and desperate when he first meets his mystery lady played by Kate Beckinsale. This was probably one of Molly Shannon's better performances, however that's not saying much...If you've seen the trailer, you've already seen all the originality the movie has to offer.

These are quirky and unpredictable characters that the audience comes to know and love.Jonathan Traegar is no such character.  The audience has no idea who he is or why he is behaving like he is.  Nothing is developed between the two main characters.  The sum total of their conversation on their magical night revolved around belief in fate.

I mean do we really need to see Sara touching the gum that Jon has stuck to the back of the chair.  The characters are fine in their older versions but in the younger versions, Sara is scary in her obsession in the supernatural, and Jon seems at the verge of tears for the majority of the movie. Who would ruin a engagement for either of these people? The supporting characters are great though, Jeremy Piven is inspired as the obit writer friend of Jon's who goes along on his quest, Molly Shannon as the new age store proprietor who believes in nothing she sells, has the timing to make her character believable.  Dan Cortese also does a good job in a role which has to be one of the worst characters to ever come out of a screenwriter's head.  The role may not be much, but he works well with what he is given.

Obviously fate doesn't work out then, so we fast forward a couple of years and see how fate swings in their favour this time round. Unfortunately they are both in relationships now, on the verge of getting married, but still deep down harbour feelings from the memory of each other and so go in search.The casting was great, the 2 leads had really nice chemistry, and the filming and editing was well done. But I just couldn't get beyond the story and script. The story is played pretty straight, so in order to add some zing the writers inserted a number of utterly ridiculous and out of place gags or slapstick. Seriously when I watch films like this I'm always quite prepared to detach my brainstem for a good belly laugh but I just couldn't manage it this time. Also the whole idea of them about to get married to other people and then running off to look for each other just felt quite sad.

If you watch the movie with the director's narration on the DVD, you'll see how Chelsom has a talent for infusing a film with a distinctive VISUAL stamp. He was also prescient enough to realize that the initial three scenes in the movie didn't work and insisted that they be re-shot. Watch the initial opening scene on the deleted tracks on the DVD&#x97;the opening scene that ended up in the movie is a thousand times better than the initial offering. Chelsom realized that the energy wasn't there initially, probably because the lead actors, John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale, hadn't developed sufficient chemistry (the opening scene was shot on the first day they were together on the set). Chelsom also spruces up the film with the clever use of time-lapse photography as well as the judicious use all kinds of interesting music.Despite Serendipity's 'nice look', one wonders why Chelsom decided to make this film in the first place. He sees it as a 'fairy tale' about being 'alive'&#x97;but even fairy tales cannot be mean-spirited. And that is the crux of the problem with Serendipity. Despite the seemingly magical magnetism between Jonathan Trager and Sara Thomas, their obsession with each other comes off as self-indulgent. The film's scenarist, Marc Klein, reduces Jonathan and Sara's partners&#x97;Halley (Bridget Moynahan) and Lars (John Corbett) to fates they don't deserve&#x97;in effect they have become virtual buffoons. According to Chelsom, Lars was originally supposed to be a Kenny G character but they wanted to push the envelope by transforming him into a new-age parody&#x97;somebody like 'Yanni' but more exaggerated. The Halley character is even more problematic as she is reduced to being the 'perfect' girlfriend&#x97;until being exposed as having a not-so-likable trace of obsessive-compulsiveness as part of her personality.Some people may go for the idea of a relationship based on a serendipitous chance encounter. The idea of love at first sight might actually happen in some cases but most relationships develop over a long period of 'give and take'. I think such an idea is a more realistic way of going about a relationship than having two people instantly fall in love without really knowing anything about each other. But even for those who are enamored with the idea of this superficial but instant love as a result of a chance encounter, Serendipity suffers from a lack of interaction between the two principals. For most of the movie, Cusack and Becksinsale have little screen time together.Instead, most of Serendipity focuses on the comic relief of Cusak (accompanied by his sidekick best friend Dean Kansky played by Jeremy Piven) attempting to uncover Sara's identity through a credit card receipt found inside the cashmere glove that Sara gives to Jonathan as part of the strange pact they concoct when they first meet each other. The receipt takes Cusak to Bloomingdale's where he meets a neurotic salesman played by Eugene Levy. Levy's shtick goes so far; far funnier is the arrogant and pretentious French artist, Sebastian Mignon, whose 'portrait' of Sara turns out to be a Picasso knockoff which is utterly no help to Trager and his buddy, desperate to know what the long missing Sara looks like.While Trager and Kansky's quest to find where Sara lives is mildly interesting, Sara's decision to find Jonathan by flying from California to New York (accompanied by her buddy Eve played by Molly Shannon) doesn't pack any punch at all. Unlike Jonathan, who has a credit card receipt to work with, Sara's trip back to New York is based merely on her intuition. She has no idea where to find Jonathan but believes another serendipitous meeting will take place. As it turns out she's walking around the city without a clue, while the viewer is supposed to be entertained with all kinds of ridiculous moments of déjà vu (for example, when Sara finds the gum on the back of the bench which Trager had left earlier at the golf range). There are even more incredible coincidental moments such as when Halley turns out be Eve's old college friend. Director Chelsom was even going to have Sara and Eve get into the SAME cab as Jonathan and Dean are seen making their exit, but admits to nixing the idea on the grounds that the coincidental moment was just too beyond the pale.When Halley hands Jonathan the book, Love in the Time of Cholera', which contains Sara's phone number, it's a bit of a stretch but in keeping with the direction in which Serendipity has been taking us. But the coincidence of the $5 bill returning to Sara's hands was completely far-fetched given the number of $5 bills in circulation in New York City.Equally perplexing is the sudden disappearance of Sara and Jonathan's respective lovers at the film's denouement. Again, in order for Sara and Jonathan's romance to work, the other lovers must be completely dispensable. That includes all the real-life recriminations between the families we should have been privy to surrounding the calling off of the Jonathan-Halley nuptials.Once Jonathan and Sara are back in each other's arms at film's end, I wonder if this is a couple I really should have been rooting for all along. If the message here is 'true love conquers all', does it have to involve such selfishness? Perhaps it would have been better if Lars and Holly ended up together which might have softened the blow of the respective couples' split-ups.Despite excellent direction and cinematography, Serendipity is a fluff piece which is instantly forgettable. Proof for me is that I had initially forgotten that I had seen it back in October 2001 while watching it for a second time recently on DVD.

If I were having a John Cusack festival in my video rental store, I would not want this to be one of the available titles. Cusack and Kate Beckinsale, an Elizabeth Hurley-lookalike the way Sandra Bullock used to be a cheap alternative to Julia Roberts, meet cute fighting over a pair of winter gloves in Bloomingdale's. Problem is, they both have significant others and both are headed for the altar given time. But they manage to spend a pleasant snowy evening in Manhattan, first over coffee at a deli called (what else?) SERENDIPITY and then ice skating in Central Park. They promise to meet up again if chance should allow it, he by writing his name and number on a $5 bill and she by writing her name and number in a book. Don't ask how this is supposed to actually work. Some years later, they continue to pine for each other as they prepare for their respective nuptuals. Cusack is about to marry a gal about 10 times sexier and prettier than Hurley -- oops, I meant Beckinsale! -- and she is engaged to the incredibly sexy John Corbett. Plus she now lives in California while Cusack still hangs in the Big Apple. The point is, it's not as if these two don't have some pretty significant others. Cusack spends most of the movie chasing around trying to find his lost love, with best buddy Jeremy Piven at his side. Both are wasted, although Cusack gives it his best. If Beckinsale continued to make such movies, she'd be forgotten today. She barely registers here. Molly Shannon is Beckinsale's best buddy, and even the normally flamboyant Shannon barely registers. Every single step in this movie is as predictable as the fake snow that seems to fall at all the right moments in this hackneyed romantic drivel. And while you have to believe Cusack and Beckinsale will find each other in the end, it is sadly predictable that it will not be allowed to occur until the closing moments. Cusack and Beckinsale perform together for maybe 10 minutes of the movie. Eugene Levy has what used to be called a walk on, and you just know he must have been a last-minute addition thanks to his success as the kooky father in the American PIE series. He manages to grab a stray laugh or two playing a rather larcenous department store clerk. If you value your sanity, you will skip this one.

Sadly, the film fails on the most basic level to entertain, leaving the viewer with nothing but a more-than-mild case of hatred for the protagonists and a sick feeling in their stomachs.In You've Got Mail the idea that Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan were developing a relationship behind their respective significant others' backs worked because their significant others were shallow, nasty people that we could muster no love for, who continually let down and abused Tom and Meg.  In Serendipity, John Cusack is about to marry a wonderful woman.  But he is obsessed with a brief encounter he once had with Kate Beckinsale's character, to the point of being willing to abandon his wedding for a chance to meet her.  From the first minutes of the movie, when he revealed that he had a girlfriend, and yet was willing to start a relationship with Beckinsale's character, Cusack's character lost the viewers sympathy.  In the most stomach turning scene in the movie, when his fiancee gives him the key to find Beckinsale, and, incidentally, dump his fiancee and destroy her life, he looks at her, his face blank, thanks her, and leaves to find another woman.The characters in Serendipity are never more than shallow and self-centered, willing to mislead their fiancee's, lie, even cheat, for just one chance to have, not just happiness, but ultimate happiness.If these characters had shown any honesty, any decency towards the jilted parties, perhaps it would have been a different movie.  Instead the characters seem to go out of their way to pile lie upon lie, deception upon deception.

It's a film for those among us who wouldn't look any deeper into a movie's substance than John Cusack's smarmy exterior. Those who have the notion that this film should be forgiven for its serious short-comings simply because it's a romance, should fall into the above mentioned categories as well.  As stated in my one line Summary, the perfect movie for emotional retards; people who coo at the slightest sight of 'cuteness' (i.e. a baby puking)I don't know what's more disturbing.  The actions of the characters in this story, or the ability for the fans of this tripe to look past the fact that the characters they're rooting for are sick, mentally disturbed individuals.The movie's central theme is that these two attractive New Yorkers are supposedly destined by fate to be with each other, despite no evidence to the contrary. Just a bunch of mere coincidences that do not add up to fate.Fate is defined as The supposed force, principle, or power that predetermines events. Perhaps so, but I was never convinced that there was any 'force' involved in this story besides the screenplay.These characters tempt fate like they were playing a game of pin-the-tail-on-the-Donkey.  They meet, they share coffee, they're totally into each other, yet Kate Beckinsdale's character Sara, has doubts. If this is love at first sight, why does she still have so many doubts? However after much prodding from Jon (John Cusack) she eventually submits to exchanging numbers - as soon as the exchange takes place, a strong gust of wind blows it out of Jon's hand. Mind you, strong gusts of wind in New York City in the middle of winter are NOT unusual, and fate has nothing to do with it.  However Sara takes it as a sign, and hence the Fate games commence, starting with the Guess-the-Floor-I'm-going-to-in-the-elevator-trick. Comedy ensues when the hapless Jon, who's only sole motivation at this point is just trying to get laid with this attractive British chick, coincidentally picks the right floor, but is hampered by a child with a fascination for buttons.  O'Comedy!!  Needless to say that later on, the screenplay sets up more of these ridiculous, near-misses for the audience to squirm over.The other disturbing aspect of this movie, is that after all is said and done, these two fateful individuals go on with the rest of their lives... the movie picks up six years later.  Their lives having taken them in two different directions, they're now living in two separate relationships. They're both on the verge of being married, yet they realize they have one last oat to sew - that big `What if'. Hence they both embark on this quest to find each other.  Not only disregarding the reality of the situation but that they totally justify destroying the lives of their partners in the process.I'm sorry, as much as I wanted to like this film when I saw it, it's just too derivative, insulting, and contrived.  The characters aren't romantic, they're deranged. They're actions irresponsible.  If being irresponsible, inconsiderate, self-centered, and delusional are romance, than call me Ebenezer Scrooge.

First of all, the one thing Sleepless lacks is having the main characters meet at some point earlier in the film, which gives us no real reason to want them to be together at the end. Here, the main characters meet at the beginning and not again until the end, so this time we feel like they had a reason to be in love. This film has some real motivation for John Cusack and Kate Beckinsdale to find each other, since they knew what each other was like, rather than one hearing the other over the radio. This film also doesn't make us endure the annoying, bratty kid from Sleepless and leaves us to focus on the main characters. Serendipity is still not an overly great film, but manages to be enjoyable and allows us to care enough about these characters to appreciate the ending.

They spend a magical evening together and Jonathan wants to keep in touch, but romantic-minded Sara has a different view of what that should be about -she believes in destiny and in that they will meet again if they are meant to be together. A capricious game with destiny will ensue and span a long time, with Jonathan and Sara each having their own life, but never really forgetting about each other...Upon that premise, Serendipity is a bit different from your typical romantic comedy. The truth is that it falls weak on the latter, but the storyline is intriguing enough to keep you watching what the movie is lacking in comedy is made up for by the gentle suspense surrounding the two semi-strangers and the hints that they are going to be reuniting sometime soon.Not a big fan of this genre myself, I would still have given this movie a higher score if it weren't because of the contradictions that it entails, mainly in the words and actions of the two main characters -which, might I add, don't come across as especially likable or charming, especially given the fact that many people tend to relate to the heroes and heroines of romantic comedies. I also felt that many of the valid points that the movie makes along the way were put to waste and were left as just lines on a script.With all that, though, this should still be fun to watch for any rom-com fan.

Kate Beckinsale plays The Woman Of Mystery competently. The two come together, go apart, and I'll bet you can't guess the ending.My favorite part of this picture is the relationship between Cusack's character and his best friend. It's unfortunate that such a brilliant comic pairing couldn't have been made on Beckinsale's side. Her best friend is quite dim and provides nothing for the film except flimsy plot points.It's a standard romantic comedy. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because...I don't know. Perhaps because there were too many opportunities for ratcheting up the intensity or interest that went by the wayside. Perhaps because I wanted to sleep during several scenes. Regardless, it's utterly forgettable entertainment that certainly won't go down in any enduring best of compilations.

John Cusack's jaded sports writer and Kate Beckinsale's new-age trainee psychiatrist make a good-looking and interesting match that would have any audience rooting for them, but no less pleasant to witness is the easy camaraderie between Cusack and real-life buddy, Jeremy Piven, who gets some of the best lines in the film.

Decisions and plot lines are not even a little plausible but there is a great chemistry between John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale that really makes up for that. So let's not talk about the story, which in a way is always predictable with romantic comedies. I mean, the two stars will end up together, right? Besides the chemistry there are funny moments too, most of them with John Cusack. I always like him and especially in films where he has to look sad and disappointed for quite some time he is terrific. He did it in 'High Fidelity' and 'America's Sweethearts' and now in 'Serendipity' again. It seems so natural you just have to feel sorry for the guy, who is occasionally quite the comedian as well. Beckinsale is mainly there for her beautiful British accent and the sweetness she brings to her weird character with her strange decisions. At least she is a lot better here than in 'Pearl Harbor', although I guess that was not really her fault. There is also a great cameo by Eugene Levy, Jim's Dad from the 'American Pie'-films. I am not sure whether he is really that funny, but by just seeing him I laughed.In the end 'Serendipity' is a romantic comedy that works because of the stars and everything they put into this film. Plausible stories are never really something we see in romantic comedies, although the very best do a pretty good job, 'When Harry Met Sally' and 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' to name some. Still, this is fun and sweet and we feel happy at the end. No reason to complain.

I mean, if you'd just met someone that may well be your soul mate; would you really let them go and leave it up to fate to bring you back together? No, me neither; but Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack decide to do just that and that's the springboard for this romantic comedy. However, to it's credit; it does work and, for a change, here we have a romantic comedy with a definite point. Obviously it deals with fate; but there are also elements of finding the right person and not being able to be happy with someone you know isn't that person. It's true that the film could have been a lot better, as on the whole it's rather poorly handled and spends too much time being sweet or trying to be funny, and not enough is spent on building up the characters so that we'll care for them enough for it to be effective; but still, the film is a lot of fun and it's a damn sight more interesting than the vast majority of films in it's class.John Cusack is an actor that I rate. I don't think he's made anything poignantly brilliant at this time, but for many of his films; he's the best thing in it. That is a comment towards the quality of many of his films, but also towards his talent as an actor, as I feel he has the ability to hold an audience's attention and deliver a fine performance while doing so. The beautiful Kate Beckinsale joins him. Kate isn't a brilliant actress, as she shows in this film, but she is absolutely beautiful and she and Cusack make a nice couple together on screen. However, due the plot; they don't get to spend a lot of the running time together, with only one brief, if nice, spurt. The film is dogged by the usual romantic comedy hindrances, such as unlikely situations and a soundtrack of pre-recorded songs when a score would have worked much better; but the film is a good time and seeing the two's lives intertwine while not actually meeting is a quirky, and somewhat genius.As I said, this could and by all accounts should have been better. Still, it is what it is and it is good escapism.

With a device as silly as this you better hope that the acting and the script have something better to offer. Sadly they don't!John Cusack is a master at these lone romantic movies - reading through his credits he seems to play the oddball, the misfit or the self-pitying eccentric more often than most.  Maybe if he stood upright properly, put his shoulders back and spoke in a clear and confident voice he would get a wider choice of roles. The guy has a good head of dark hair, a slim build, a pleasant face  and is well  over six feet tall - he doesn't need to keep playing the man that has self-doubt over whether to use the bathroom or not.Kate Beckinsale is quite nice and well spoken, but doesn't have anything to suggest she is a star. There is no humorous undercurrent to her and the dialogue just falls out of her mouth like she is reading a dinner menu out-loud. She is supposed to be running around (literally) finding a man that she has let slip away, but her eyes are dead a dodos - I don't believe it. Mind you even Sandra Bullock couldn't make this work and she is the queen of offbeat romance!You can just see the pitch with this film A light romance with a twist. But the twist keeps the people in love apart so we don't really have much of a romance. It is more a pointless chase movie and even the most naive  watcher knows full well how it is going to end.

They are both attached at the time, and decide to let fate step in if they are truly meant to be.  Cut forward a couple of years and Cusack is about to be married, yet something is drawing him to seek out this woman who made such an impact on him.  The premise is standard romantic schlock, but the script is blessedly peppered with some intellect and clever lines.  Piven and Cusack once again make a great team.  I got absolutely nothing out of Beckinsdale's performance, it could have been played by anyone.  Cusack basically saves this film from being a completely ridiculous romance - his character is basically a grown up extension of his character in Say Anything.

Okay, well let me start out from the beginning. I loved happy, romantic comedies for a long time. A Family member and I were on vacation and happen to go see A.I.-(Great Movie As Well)- I had already seen it, but what I hadn't seen the first time was the trailer of Serendipity. When with my relative, the second time, I did! I told myself I had to see it.2 Months or so went by and I am setting on my bed, eating dinner, and I almost, literally, drop my plate. There it was, on TV, Serendipity Sneak Preview- Saturday Night. So, a friend and I went to see the preview, and I loved it-(even though I missed a really good part, when I went to the bathroom- laugh) So, I sat there, watching an awesome cast tell this amazing story, of love, fate, & destiny. The first thing that popped in my head was Christmas In Manhattan. First of all, I love Christmas movies, and this one hit the spot. Now, you're probably wondering what I'm talking about when saying Christmas In Manhattan. Well, there is this CD, produced by David Huntsinger, called the exact same name. I got it back in 1997, for like $4 at Wal-Mart, the Christmas music on it was so excellent, and peaceful, that you felt you were actually in New York! So, since Serendipity is about Christmas In Manhattan I was thrilled, and it was a wonderful, elegent film. So good, that I still actually have my ticket from the sneak preview. It was Saturday, September 29, 2001, it was a night to remember.I saw it once more on the big screen, then it finally came to video April 9, 2002. Sadly, I decided to save my money for other DVD's. Boy, did I make the wrong decision. So, 3 months ago I used a Wal-Mart gift card someone had gotton me, and bought My Big Fat Greek Wedding Soundtrack, and Serendipity DVD! Since then I have watched it over 22 times, not to mention all the times I already watched it, because right after it came out I kept on renting it! Now, I also own the soundtrack, which I can't stop listening too.Wow, what a movie! A great cast, plot, and soundtrack. I can honestly say that Serendipity has got me through rouge times, and through life since it entered my life back in 2001! I always turn to it, and it always entertains me. The lovely music from such artists as Shawn Colvin, Louis Armstrong, Wood, and so many more make you cry tears of joy, and John Cusake & Kate Beckinsale along with the whole cast make you cheer for more! And little things like Christmas In Manhattan for me make it even better. Do not think for one minute doubting Serendipity.I Have entered it into my family as well. I've also got my 2 stepsisters, who are 4 & 8 years-old hooked on it as well. So as you can see it's a great movie for all ages! Serendipity will lead you to a poweful faith in what the ancients used to call fatum- what we currently refer to as destiny!

Normally this is just a metaphor.  But in this case something very like torture is involved.  A straightforward story has been twisted, with what I can only assume to be malice, into a hideously gnarled shape; whether the ultimate end is the torture of the characters or the torture of the audience is a matter of little moment.  I recall taking a dim view of the FAR superior Spanish film Lovers of the Arctic Circle for indulging in precisely this kind of contrived suspense, but Serendipity is enough to make its over-indulgent rival look tasteful and restrained.  The film consists of NOTHING but a series of desperately pointless skits, all variants of the following the two estranged lovers are brought by chance to the same place, only to fail to notice one another.  How long can this kind of thing go on?  As long as it takes.  (In this case, ninety minutes.)A popular critical charge laid against far better movies than this is that the photography is decorative - the scenery too pretty, the shots too picturesque, etc.  But films which are full of images which are attractive per se but a liability to the film as a whole are, in fact, rare - so rare that at the moment I can only think of two.  This is one of them.  The beautiful shots of New York are utterly devoid of magic in context; in order to realise that they're beautiful, you have to pretend that you're watching some other movie.  (No doubt this is what some people did.)  All that the plush, gold-drenched shots of New York department stores conveyed to me is how much more money these people have than they know what to do with.Fans of the banal will be pleased to hear that we get to listen to not one but five bland pop songs, in the usual way  - you know, when (for instance) the hero is disconsolate about losing the heroine, and we see a series of shots of him looking disconsolate while someone sings a tuneless, computer-generated ditty about how disconsolate he is ... that kind of thing.  Maybe it's not five songs but one song five times.  It's hard to tell.I will say this much those who say that John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale are behaving like stalkers have it all wrong.  Maybe this would be the best explanation for their behaviour in real life, but we know it's not the case in the fiction, so why bring the point up?  Neither lead comes across as even slightly creepy.  (Ditzy, yes; creepy, no.)  Each is doing no more than tracking down the other on the off chance, each is prepared to take no for an answer, the fact that BOTH parties are tracking surely counts for something, and both leads are, I'll admit, charming.You know a film is pretty worthless when you bend over backwards to be charitable and the best you can do is praise the cast.  They must have had better things to do than appear in so obviously misconceived a turkey.  If for some reason you badly want to see Kate Beckinsale in a romantic comedy, try Much Ado About Nothing; for John Cusack, try Better Off Dead.

Unfortunately, despite masterful direction, it could not be redeemed. 'Serendipity' is hindered by a predictable plot, wafer thin jokes and insipid performances.  Reasons to SEE this film1 - New York looks fabulous. On a serious note, I expect that many would find escapism in the way New York is captured in this film, after the horrific events of September 11th. Chesholm has encapsulated the magical essence of the city wonderfully. The New York we all know and love is on full display from beginning to end. 2 - The music. The soundtrack is excellent, mainly because of one man David Gray. His lilting and understated scores are out of place in this hackneyed film, but add to it nevertheless. 3 - There are some lightly comic moments. I think about three in total. But it is very, very gentle comedy. Gentle being the operative word. 4 - The direction is excellent. Peter Chesholm is a fabulous director as he proved with 'The Mighty'. He's wasting his time, and his talent here. For me the highlights of the film were the sections where we were shown aspects of the city and footage of scenery to music. These provided a break from the monotony of the cream cracker thin plot and 'written on the morning of the shoot' screenplay.Reasons to AVOID this film 1 - Representation of the English. To every non-UK reader reading this, can I just take the time to assure you that there is more variation to the English dialect than the stereotypical Kate Beckinsale voice? This is just a personal grievance. It seemed to me she was cast SOLELY on the basis of her English Rose beauty and Received Pronunciation voice. As a result of these superfical reasons, she falls flat, in a way that Kate Winslet wouldn't have. 2 - Kate Beckinsale. I like to call her Kate Not Winslet Beckinsale, depite the comparisons made between the two actresses after 'Pearl Harbour'. She is a beautiful woman, but she does not have the charisma and spice of Kate Winslet. In this film she just simpers. Of course, that could be because she isn't given much material to play with, but she still is not a primary reason to rush to the cinema. All round, I found performances weak and flat, except the actor who played John Cusack's best friend. He was under used. 3 - The plot is so unbelievably predictable that you find yourself writing the script in your head, and knowing what event will come next. This is not my psychic ability, more the unwritten rules of the RomCom unfolding in traditional fashion. Please give us something new. The words trite, hackneyed and unoriginal spring to mind.  4 - It's called a Romantic COMEDY but that last word is debateable. I would say the film has about two funny jokes and one instance of physical comedy. All of these are contained within the trailer. Therefore, viewing the trailer provides as much instance of comedy as viewing the entire film. Surely this is not how it should be. In a nutshell, 'Serendipity' is the cinematic equivalent of a nice cup of tea which is starting to go cold. It's just predicatable, bland but amiable. Don't rush to the cinema to see it, but if it's a choice between that and 'The Princess Diaries' perhaps plump for the former.

I love John Cusack and have liked every movie he has ever graced so it is very difficult to disappoint me, but the only shining light in this movie was Jeremy Piven and the yummy desserts pictured in the Serendipity scenes.  The storyline all but confirms that no two people will ever find their soul mates  without an incredible amount of luck.  It has nothing to do with what a good person you are, but your ability to be overdramatic about every single detail in your life.  The number of times fate had to intervene is statistically phenomenal.  What is romantic about  having your autonomy completely stripped from you?  Not only did I hate the script, but the new age montages never let my mind settle into a nice serene acceptance of the scenario.

Fortunately for me, one of them left for Australia days before and the other had to work.  The tickets were passed on to me by random luck.In a similar fashion, Sara (Kate Beckinsdale) and Jonathan(John Cusack), find their paths cross by chance one fatefull night at Bloomingdales in New York.  They become entranced by one another in a way that is believable to us the audience, and spend most of the night together.  Unfortunately the evening seems to last too long as they sara goes on and on about chance and fate.  Eventually, after many attempts of leaving one another with fate intervening they finally lose each other hoping someday they will meet again.The rest of the movie has them go back to their current relationships, then a few years later try desperately to seek one another out.  Jonathan is days away from his marriage, while sara has just become engaged.  Jonathan, with the aid of his best man (Jeremy Piven), takes on an often comical direct route approach which usually leads to nowhere before finding another way by chance.  Sara, aided by her best friend (Molly Shannon), decides to run about NewYork randomly letting fate and instinct take control.  Their paths do cross several times before they meet, but of course they don't realise it.The story as a whole is kind of hokey, but you know that if John Cusack is a star that there will be some good dialogue and some decent twists of fate. The script does just that, steering clear of cliche's and making things less predictable than most movies of this genre.  Even then, events don't happen how we think they would.Peter Chelsom decided to use his talented cast instead of wasting their skills like Town and Country.  The ever impressive John Cusack turns in anther good, and less neurotic performance.  Kate beckinsdale spreads her wings a little wider than she could in Pearl Harbour which will hopefully let us see how good she can be.  Jeremy plays the best man with a little more depth of character than he usually portrays.  Also, Molly Shannon takes her spastic SNL persona down a few notches to play Sara's best friend. Lastly, Eugene Levy has a typecast, but funny role as a retailer who reluctantly helps out along the way.Without the decent direction of Peter Chelsom, and the talented cast, this movie could've taking a definate downward spiral.  I recommend you at least see it on video or make it a date movie. "}{"Title":"Blah.

Being a cynic and something of a curmudgeon, I need an actress who can charm me into accepting the silliness of movies like this. Or at least make me forgive is deficiencies.A good example of an actress doing this is Drew Barrymore in 'Never Been Kissed.' That movie is daft in concept, bereft of wit and imagination and shot in a manner that doesn't contain a single original idea. But Drew plays her part with such earnestness and old-fashioned sweetness that, for me, it sort of worked. I felt stupid and manipulated but I can't deny I quietly cheered when Michael Vartan turned up at the end.For this movie to work, Kate Beckindale had to do something similar - work a certain magic, be impossibly lovely and trick me into accepting the movie on its own idiotic terms. But she doesn't. She may have a lovely accent and look pretty in the snow, but there's nothing engaging about her performance. Indeed, she even fails to make this character likable. I'm sure Sara was supposed to have kooky charm but she comes across as childish, impetuous and annoying.I suppose some of this could - and indeed should - be blamed on poor writing, but the main problem is that this actress just lacks that je ne sais quoi. For all the film's faults - and there are many, ranging from the dull direction to Cusack's phoned in performance - I suspect a more charming actress could have held it together.
