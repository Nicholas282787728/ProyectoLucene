Four reasons 1. It's made in a world, where movie makers tries to have some personality. If you think 'When We Were Soldiers'... well, there are hundreds of directors who you can imagine making a similar war movie with personality and values of a hamburger.2. Screenplay has a different structure. There's no shocking opening scene like in 'Saving Private Ryan'. This movie starts slowly in a very nice place and ends slowly in a very bad place, without hope or feeling that the characters have achieved something by their heroic actions.3. It is first a movie about lost causes in the world of war, and only secondly a war movie which takes place in Stalingrad.4. War scenes portray the horror, insecurity and confusion of a battle, instead of how cool, heroic and exciting fighting looks like. In this sense, this movie is closer to reality than most of the war movies you will ever see. 'Thin Red Line' also had similar I would probably crap in my pants in that situation-feeling.Stalingrad, whether you think it as a movie or a war movie has so many good things in it... like honesty. Even the ordinary German soldiers were dreaming about farms in Russia when they were advancing. What a disappointment they must have had in Stalingrad! If you like to watch war movies, meaning also other war movies than When We Were Soldiers or Saving Private Ryan, you should see this one.

It is the story of Leutnant von Witzland, Unteroffizier Rohleder, Obergefreiter Reiser, and Obersch√ºtze M√ºller and their desperate fight for survival in the deadliest battle in the history of war STALINGRAD. The film starts off in Italy in the summer of 1942 where their platoon is resting following heavy combat in North Africa. Soon they are on a train heading for the Eastern Front. The men of 1st Platoon laugh and joke, play games, write letters home, and enjoy the view of western Russia as they head for the Ukraine. This is as light-hearted as the film gets. What follows is a very accurate and graphic portrayal of the infamous battle. It pulls no punches. It's main antagonist is Hauptmann Haller, a field police officer who thinks nothing of allowing his men to abuse and murder Russian and Ukrainian prisoners. At one point he lines up a group of civilians and has them shot saying they were partisans.The combat scenes themselves are even more horrific. In one scene a German soldier hits a Russian over the head with a shovel as the Russian is trying to kill Ltn. von Witzland. In another scene a German soldier is cut in half by a Russian tank shell. There are many other gruesome scenes in the film, but they are necessary. The world has to see what happened in the Battle of Stalingrad. To see its brutality. To have its heart broken at the horrendous waste of the soldiers' lives. Over 2 million people lost there lives. Only 6000 of Field Marshal Paulus' 250,000-man 6th Army survived the battle. As with the battle, the film itself does not have a happy ending. And that's the way it should be. And as you watch this film, remember one thing, not every German soldier who fought in the war was a criminal. They were mostly decent people caught up in events well beyond their control.

I saw the results of the war in East and West Berlin in 1957. While in Berlin I lived with a girl my age who lost her father in the battle for Stalingrad. Her tales made my hair stand on end as he was one of the many young Germans send there to fight as a punishment for errors,(read that as failure to win), in other battle zones.It isn't well understood, but the Eastern Front was used as a threat and as a punishment by Hitler. Even Schindler in the film Schindler's List used that threat on the train station in order to get his bookkeeper released from the death train.There are two scenes that will haunt be for the rest of my lifeThe scene where Lt. Hans von Witzland, played by a very young and splendid Thomas Kretschmann, and the Russian actress Dana Vavrova who plays Irina.That scene is so emotionally charged that it left both actors physically shaking. I can't imagine having to repeat that scene more than once. To have to hold that raw, totally exposed feeling/expression and body language while lights are adjusted and a different angle is used must have been physically and mentally exhausting for these two brilliant actors. They perform a brutal Dance Macabre that is both horrific and fascinating. This scene is no longer about an enemy and the one who has been conquered. It is about a young man desperate to find one moment of humanity on an endless nightmare and a young woman who hates him and herself and yet can not resolve her situation. That he is a German and she is Russian is not as important as that they are both souls in torment with no way out.The human agony of that scene is superior to anything I have seen in over 60 years of watching movies.The other is the final scene between Dominique Horwitz and Kretschmann as Fritz and Hans clinging to each other overwhelmed and miniaturized by the vast Russian winter.That final scene reminds me of Napoleon's death march from Moscow in 1812. The results were to same. No enemy can come marching into Russia and live to march out again.I began watching this film firmly committed to cheering the Russians and hating the Germans.By the end I was crying for them all.That is the message of this fine film. War is a waste...a waste of human lives, of property, and of moral and religious focus.This is a classic anti-war film not unlike All Quiet on the Western Front or What Price Glory.

Saving Private Ryan, though   a great film, just doesn't bring the horror of war down to the common   foot solider as accurately as Stalingrad. Enemy At The Gates is simply   an awful movie.    Of course with such a movie will come a lot of political overtones.   I'll make just a few comments here. One, I am very thankful the allies   won World War II. Secondly, when I think of 'Nazis', I think of Hitler   and all of his cronies and all the evil villains who executed the   millions of innocent Jews in the concentration camps. I believe a   majority of Americans believe this way. The German soldiers fighting on   the front(s) were simply following orders and bravely fought in this   War as did the American, Russians and British soldiersÖ and to each was   their own personal Hell. The sad fact about Stalingrad, in watching   this movie, is that all of this really happened. Men froze and starve   to deathÖ millions of people were killed and generations were lost.

It shows the German soldiers war on the Russian front, in Stalingrad from the point of view of a few German soldiers. It should not be viewed with the intentions of seeing the battle of Stalingrad or any strategic view of the Russian Front. This is from the eyes of a select few. You won't see the broad picture. Just like the average soldier doesn't see it. He knows and sees the part of the war that is directly around him. That is his world and that is how you will see it. It's often very graphic and brutally honest in its depictions. The cold and the feeling of hopelessness were excellently portrayed. You could just feel it. I did have one major problem with the German English barrier. I watched this on DVD. It was dubbed in English and I chose to also play it with English subtitles. I started to see that frequently the subtitles and the dubbing were different. That was annoying hearing one thing and reading different words for the same lines. I soon shut off the subtitles and started watching it over again from the beginning without the subtitles. I have no idea if the subtitles or the dubbing was the more accurate translation. I'm very glad I viewed this film and I'm sure that I will watch it a second time. Highly recommended. A must see for the historian and war movie fan.

It's true, Stalingrad does offer little that's new in terms of character, screenplay, visuals. And yes, any war buffs coming to this film in hope of some depiction of the battle's broader strategic context will be disappointed. To those people I recommend Antony Beevor's highly readable book, 'Stalingrad'.Viewed from a straightforward standpoint, Stalingrad is a pretty compelling war film that is nevertheless a league below US celluloid depictions of the battlefield when it comes to depicting the fate of the 'poor bloody infantry', the second half of Full Metal Jacket, the first quarter-hour of Saving Private Ryan, or much of Black Hawk Down is infinitely superior. And yes, its ending is something of a wimp-out. Consider, however, that many people compare Stalingrad to FMJ, Ryan, or BHD at all, however unfavourably, and you see something of the revolution of Vilsmaier's flick. What he achieves is a pretty conventional squad-level war flick - ABOUT THE WEHRMACHT. A film about the German armed forces in WWII which invites sympathy. This, don't underestimate it, is important. At no stage is this a Nazi-apologist film. In fact, its over-willingness to be Nazi-condemnatory is what makes much of its dialogue and scenes weak. But no matter whether you find it tame or not, you do eject this one from the VHS or DVD tray thinking poor b--tards. As the Holocaust, through the global ceremony of Holocaust Day on January 27 and through the power of global films like Spielberg's Schindler's List, becomes transported away from a specific time and place into a world parable of evil, so we are able to reappraise the role of the German soldier as victim. What attitude you take to this question is your affair - Vilsmaier's film is important for daring to raise it in the first place.

Thus the film's last and symbolic shot is devoid of a deeper meaning, Th√® anti-war film based on the Stalingrad event - as Vilsmaier has clearly given himself as task - is never established. An anti-war film it may be, but die Br√ºcke by Bernhard Wicki still has far more impact. It also noteworthy that the film concentrates on the German soldiers only and hardly shows anything on the Russian side.Moreover as far as the political side is concerned the film never surpasses the level of the 08/15 films by Paul May it is simple in its division between the politically good and bad soldier, finding the latter in the higher ranks only, while the lower and lowest in rank are basically decent people;  the soldier is just another victim of the regime. Compare this, if you have ever the opportunity, to what 6 German ex-soldiers tell about their experiences at the Russian front in the documentary Mein Krieg by Harriet Eder and Thomas Kufus (q.v.). I certainly do not want to suggest that Vilsmaier excuses the war (or worse), but he does not succeed in incorporating the socio-political situation, if he had ever the intention to do so..There are surely impressive scenes (short truce in the plant; attack of Russian tanks, shooting of Russian civilians e.g.) and the battle scenes ar extremely well choreographed; the cinematography is sometimes stunning. But on the minus side the cast is never more than average and the music is heavy handed.In short despite elementary shortcomings, certainly worth a view.

That so many German and Russian boys should die in the snow-bound wilderness around Stalingrad is a tragedy beyond comprehension.  The camera crew did a great job in bringing to the screen the vastness of Russia with soldiers camouflaged in white struggling on the point of death across frozen landscapes.  Far from home and missing their loved ones the German soldiers are depicted as rough diamonds with kind hearts sharing their last crust of bread with starving Russian children.  The over-all German plan is to take certain cities important in the flow of oil and supply of food to the Russian enemy, but their plans are thwarted when the Russian armies encircle them.  The close fighting is well filmed with lots of explosions, flames and shattered bodies among fallen masonry.  I liked particularly the contrast of the opening scenes in sunny Porto Cervo (where the Germans are celebrating their recent victories) with the tragic scenes which followed when calamity overtakes them.I thought too that the three struggling figures exhausted in defeat symbolised the horrific loss of human life and the futility of war.  While none of the actors shone above the others, their characterisations were adequate enough though I got somewhat confused with such a large cast and all the same uniforms.  The lasting impression is not with individual performances but with the over-all mood of this tragic event captured superbly under expert direction.

Stalingrad shows well the realities of close combat and what the cumulative experience can do and often does to the human psyche.

My granddad was a soldier at Stalingrad and when I was a small girl I used to listen to his stories of how he defeated the Germans. He also told me some anecdotes, not all he told me was gloomy. But it was long ago, and no when I have a conscious interest for what happened there in the battle of Stalingrad, I have to turn to books and movies for information. Somehow most films I saw were made in the Soviet Union, only a few in present day Russia. And ‚ÄúStalingrad‚Äù is an exception. In the movie the war is described from the opposite side, and the fact in itself is interesting. All that is shown in the film is quite different from what I‚Äôm used to.The film reminds me a great deal of Remarque‚Äôs ‚ÄúZeit zu leben und Zeit zu sterben‚Äù, because the war is shown through an ordinary German soldier perception. And this soldier or lieutenant is rather obsessed by repeating he is by no means a fascist. The movie heroes right from neat and enthusiastic Europe, from the Italian coast arrive in the snow-covered hungry Soviet Union. They are doomed to die; it is clear from the very beginning.After the elite detachment had taken part in their first fight at Stalingrad, one of the soldiers said the phrase which reflected the whole idea for me; he said ‚ÄúIf you start thinking, you will go mad‚Äù. And to my mind it is true for spectators as well. From the one hand, one may think, OK, I‚Äôll just watch this movie and it won‚Äôt dissipate me, I needn‚Äôt feel sorry for the people on the screen as it were they who attacked my country and not vice versa. However sooner or later but inevitably one starts sympathizing with the characters. Probably when the lieutenant chokes back his tears at seeing Kolya‚Äôs execution.‚ÄúStalingrad‚Äù is hard to watch, all these frostbitten legs, dirt, executions, snow, famine, destroyed illusions.As far as I know, Lt. Hans von Witzland is one of the few films where Thomas Kretschmann played his star roles. I watched quite many Hollywood movies where he was given unimportant parts of small fries, such as ‚ÄúNext‚Äù or ‚ÄúTranssiberian‚Äù (why did he do it?!). And after I had watched ‚ÄúStalingrad‚Äù, I cannot make out the European actors desire to appear in American movies, even second-rated at any cost. The fact puzzles me deeply. I believe Thomas Kretschmann deserves better parts and much better screenplays than those he is given in Hollywood. And out of what I saw with him, ‚ÄúStalingrad‚Äù is the best, beyond the doubt.In my opinion the worst ‚ÄúStalingrad‚Äù drawback is the way they speak Russian in the movie. I mean of course those who are supposed to be Russian. Say, the boy who spent some time with the Germans or the girl with whom they planned to escape. Was it really so difficult to find actors able to pronounce a couple of phrases without that horrible accent? Initially I set down to watch ‚ÄúStalingrad‚Äù just to listen to native German-speakers because I‚Äôm studying the language. I did not expect anything extraordinary of the film. But it impressed me, made me cry when I wasn‚Äôt going to at all. I know I‚Äôm 15 years late to watch it, but ‚ÄúStalingrad‚Äù is not a run-of-the-mill movie, and after 15 years it is still watchable and shocking.

When you pick one and look carefully at it, you wonder why this pearl lie almost unknown and why it's not already on the crown.Stalingrad is such a gem. Why, it has a bunch of multi-million dollars rated actors? No. It have thousand of extras? No. It have breathtaking, spectacular, shiny computerized visual effects?. Not at all. So, what's so special? Well, in one word, it's pure past reality recreated and transposed to celluloid fifty years later. The tragedy of the most bloody battle in the history is here. Filthy, wounded soldiers, Russian civilians who lost everything during the invasion, burning villages, collapsing buildings, decayed suburbs, gunfires, explosions, tanks in flames, soldiers shot, burned alive, ground by tanks in their pits or shred to pieces - you got all. But the real horror is elsewhere. People are reduced to simple pawns, without the power to change anything. The soldiers we follow in film try to leave the combat zone and they fail. The civilians stay in prostration in the middle of nowhere, only crying for their children killed. Mercyless, the huge grinding machine of war melt together humans, equipment, villages, cities - and ask for more victims and destruction, over and over.In all this collective insanity a group of German soldiers struggle to survive and to keep at least a minimum level of normality. They do their duty and fight bravely. But, as everyone know, a battle is almost lost when people start to loose confidence and faith. We see how all those people are abandoned, how they plan to desert, how they struggle to catch the very last plane to Berlin (full of wounded), how some very bad injured soldiers were treated as simulants and shot, how they were forced to execute a small group of Russian civilians, including a young boy, how they later discovered a place literally full up to the ceiling of food and drinks - destined only for some superior officers, of course. One by one, they drop dead. The end of the movie is one of the most bitter, depressing and touching ending I ever saw, all on the magnificent score of The Munich Philarmonic Orchestra. The war destroyed everything in its path.This movie is a must-see for everyone. A true movie-lover should have it in his/her collection. The strong anti-war message must be a warning for all of us.

Furthermore, from what I can see the experiences documented in the film are by and large 'true' - if you read A. Beevor's book 'Stalingrad' you will know what I mean. The film is also successful in the sense that it doesn't allow character or plot to dominate it - it is simply a tale of survival, that attempts to depict the battle mainly from the ordinary (German) soldier's point of view. I've read somewhere that the original screenplay had to be toned down, which doesn't surprise me at all - if they tried to really show what the battle was like, it would have been almost impossible to make I'm sure. Even so, there are still some moments that are difficult to watch - this was made before Private Ryan but is possibly even harder-hitting in places. Just one word of caution - don't buy the dubbed 'English' version, it's pretty awful and spoils the film - try to get a copy in the original (German) version with English subtitles, it's far more powerful.

Just because there was no happy ending doesn't mean it has no storyline. There was a horrid truth in this movie. I wouldn't necessarily call it anti-war. It had a political statement of course, but the movie wasn't all about the politics. In fact, except for a few occurrences when the Captain? showed up, there was never a stifling air of Nazi Germany. They were far enough out of the reach of the main Nazi party.

It was a losing battle, of course the movie is going to be depressing. And to the person who said that it was gutsy (and silly) to even portray Germans as victims there are victims on all sides in every war (any real soldier will tell you that).This movie is a fine balance between movie and documentary. A few problems with it when arguing for just one, but it instills the best of both worlds. Watch it as such.

It is an event in history that sends a shiver down the spine . Nazi Germany lost one quarter of its total strength on the Eastern front during this one battle . That's if you can even call it a battle , the number of forces involved meant it was more of campaign . And if the scale of the battle wasn't mind numbing enough it's the conditions and ferocity of the fighting that sticks in the mind . As a young schoolboy in the 1970s I vividly remember reading accounts  that every brick in every house in every street was bitterly fought over  . Even in the 21st century with the invasion of Iraq military experts have to emphasise that the capture of Baghdad wouldn't resemble Stalingrad in anyway . In short if you want to visualize war at its most cruel and brutal pick up a history book on Stalingrad . You almost feel sorry for the bad guys . I did say  almost This is a slight problem with this cinematic account of the battle . STALINGRAD is a very well regarded German film and being a German film it feels the need to make a very clear line between good Germans who are portrayed as the ones who are conscripted in to the Wermacht who do all the fighting and dying in pursuit of Nazi ideals and bad Germans who blindly follow Nazi genocidal laws and never serve in the front line. Even the classic DAS BOOT suffers from this viewpoint . The only film that doesn't portray villains as Nazis is the Anglo German production CROSS OF IRON which has a Prussian aristocrat as the bad German . Would it not be a nice change that Germans murdering innocent people weren't necessarily goose stepping Nazis ? The truth is there were plenty of ordinary Wermacht units implicated in crimes against humanity on the Eastern front in the early 1940s For the majority of the film director Joseph Vilsmaier and screenwriter Jurgen Buscher tend to ignore politics and concentrate on making an anti-war film on a grand epic scale . They succeed too as a battalion of 400 men is quickly drained to a troop of 62 men carrying out full frontal assaults against desperate Soviet defenders . The film makers also make a very important point that Nazi Germany was a Christian nation and include a scene where a padre addresses a congregation emphasising that the Germans have God on their side where as the Bolsheviks are Godless atheists . This scene alone meant I could easily forgive the slight clich√©s that creep in to the film Slight clich√©s are easily forgiven . Unfortunately the more the film goes on the more clich√©s come firing at the audience quicker than a Soviet counter-attack . What become even more unforgivable is the introduction of very contrived plotting as in  Someone must do something unlikely and even more unlikely a character who they already know appears to move the plot forward  A number of people who dislike this movie have pointed out the unlikely coincidences of characters who appeared in the film earlier appear and they're right . It's not enough to destroy the film but a battle on the scale of Stalingrad to have people bumping in to each other the way it happens here strains all credibility . Likewise the final third of the film is rather static where people have existentialist discussions and feels more like a German New Wave film from Rainer Werner Fassbinder In short STALINGRAD is a film I always wanted to see since it was released almost 20 years ago . It was worth the wait . It's a sweeping epic war film and is much praised for the battle sequences . It isn't flawless and unfortunately the flaws are very easy to spot and take issue with .

Sure it centers on the longest and bloodiest battle in world history, in the most expansive theater of the most costly war in terms of lives, money, and mat√©riel that has ever occurred. Yes it contains action scenes depicting bitter battles and terrible destruction. The visceral storytelling and harsh images though make it something more than a war film, even more than an anti-war film. Stalingrad is instead a film about absolute and undeniable hell.The film is fraught with visual descriptions of the worst kind of war, one that is intensely personal and close, where days are spent in taking one city block, only to have it re-taken in a surprise assault. The early form of modern urban warfare that the Germans came to call Rattenkrieg (Rat Warfare) is depicted in brutal and uncompromising terms. The characters war in sewer tunnels, rail yards, and from building to building in the hellish bomb-scape of ruined Stalingrad, only to be defeated by the unforgiving Russian winter.The film deals with the issue of Nazism and the vilification of Germans in that period in the way that many other films from both Germany and the rest of the world do. Its characters are a group of soldiers swept along by the winds of war and simply attempting to make it out with themselves and as many of their comrades as possible alive. The characters do not fight the Soviets out of any ideological hatred between National Socialism and Soviet Communism, not for any grand dream of Grossdeutschland or racial superiority. They fight only because if they do not the enemy will kill them, and if the enemy does not then their own officers certainly will for refusing to fight. This portrayal adds another layer to the suffocating envelope of trapped hopelessness that pervades the film.A sort of ground based companion to Das Boot, Stalingrad frames the epic struggle of World War Two in a personal light and from the unexpected perspective of the ordinary German soldier as a sort of hero made tragic by circumstance and a brutal government that would pervert his sacrifice.

It's always interesting to see the story from the 'other' side for a change. This movie concentrates on a group of German soldiers who after fighting in the North Africa campaign are send to Stalingrad, Russia, where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of WW II is being fought.It's interesting to see the other side of this battle, since we mainly just always see the Germans simply as the 'villains'. In this movie those 'villains' are given an humane face and voice and it sort of makes you realize that the only true enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those who you're fighting against. At first it's kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the German's are the evil villains. But of course you get accustomed to it quickly and you soon adapt the Germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start to care -and be interested in them.The way this story is told isn't however the best. It's hard to keep track of the story at times, as it jumps from the one sequence and location to the other. The movie isn't always logic in its storytelling and features a bit too many sequences that remain too vague. It also is most of the time pretty hard to keep the characters apart and see who is who. It doesn't always makes this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand, there are plenty enough sequences and moments present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one, just not the most coherent one around. In that regard Hollywood movies are always better than European movies.The production values are high and features some good looking sets and locations, though the movie wasn't even shot in Russia itself. It helps to create a good war time situation atmosphere.The character are mostly interesting although perhaps a tad bit formulaic. But I don't know, for some reason formulaic characters always work out fine in war movies and strenghtens the drama and realism. It also helps that they're being played by well cast actors. All of the actors aren't the best known actors around (Thomas Kretschmann was also at the time still a fairly unknown actor) but each of them fit their role well and gives its characters an unique face and personality.All in all not the best or most consistent WW II drama around but definitely worth a look, due to its original approach of the German side of the battle of Stalingrad and its good production values.7/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"An authentic view on the horrors of the most tragic and meaningful battle of World War 2 -  just like Das Boot this is a masterpiece which could never come out of Hollywood.","Date":"8 May 2010","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" Stalingrad is a jewel among the war movies as it manages to portrait the highly dramatic events in the decisive battle of the second World War in a credible way and without any Hollywood-style heroism or pathos.

But unlike shown in weekly propaganda news films, the German soldiers are neither depicted as heroes nor as Nazis, but simply as fathers, abandoned husbands and football fans, which share one common will to somehow survive and return home.This movie may not be taken light hearted as there is a lot of fighting and dieing and the effects of weapons and ammunition are presented in a rather impressive and authentic way. Yet Stalingrad is not about the battle action but about feeling the madness of war and having empathy for the protagonists' small hopes of escaping the horrors of winter hell.

The problem is as it looks too real and by that drags you in to the ruins of Stalingrad and make you suffer for both sides. This is for the reason that this film unlike the most of Hollywood films doesn't glorify the war or the heroism of the main characters. Instead of that, the film makes them heroes only for being human and by that is anti-war as much as the reason can offer. Extremely convincing war scenes and so impressive acting, most of the scenes look like isolated theater pieces. Also, German army is played by Germans which is so convincing as well. The film is produced and realized by Germans where you can see their love for details to perfection. This is the reason why Stalingrad is one of the films I can watch million times and never feel dull. I watched the film with my father who fought in WWII and the first thing he said was This is like real, this is how the war against Germans looked like.

We have seen many war films from the point of views of Russians, Jews, Poles etc. But this was my first world war 2 movie seen from a German soldier's point of view. The film starts when a battalion of German soldiers are ordered to go to Stalingrad. When they think about going to Stalingrad, they think of farms and greenery but when they reach Stalingrad, the truth is far different than the reality.The German soldiers think they could win Russia within a month, their very notion turns into disbelief as they enter Stalingrad, and see thousands of wounded German soldiers. Stalingrad war was indeed the biggest mistake of Germany, and it proved the beginning of the end for Germany, and resurrection of Russia. One thing I always wondered as a child, when a war is waged why there is no confusion, how always a particular army perfectly distinguishes its soldiers from the opponents'.In the very beginning, when Germans invade Stalingrad, we see a massive confusion within the battalion and a German soldier inadvertently kills his fellow soldier. As you may do research, you will find that there was a huge chaos during the world war 2 and such incidents occurred. One thing that the director wants to convey is that all the German soldiers were not blood grubbing monsters, even they were tired of killing other people, even they wanted to go home. But they had no options, if they didn't kill , they would have been killed by their superiors.This thing is evident when a young Russian boy is captured by the German army, and the soldiers who are protagonists in the movie are told to shoot the boy with dozens of other people. They are reluctant to shoot the boy, but their fascist superior warns them that if they didn't shoot those civilians, they would be next in queue. Stalingrad is an attempt by the director to earn some sympathy for the German soldiers, who were always seen as culprits, but this film shows they were victims too.I don't want to get into the war crimes that Germans committed in Russia and other nations, but when you view a film you have to see it impartially. At the very outset of the film, it is very much clear that you are not going to see a happy end as you see in Hollywood. This film makes 'Enemy at the gates' look a very cheap film which is far from reality, as it creates Rachel Weisz's character in the film. This film is not for the people who want to see war films just for the sake of explosions and killings of people.We see scenes in the film where a German soldier shares his bread with a civilian, and also in the end when the Hans Von Witzland refuses to rape a helpless Russian female soldier. This film tells us about the fate of the soldiers who were stuck there and knew what was coming to them. In fact, this movie tells us about the harsh reality of war and it tells that the war is always bad, and there is no winner in a war. This film doesn't show that Russians were bad despite being a German film, nor it shows that Germans were heroes, but still makes its point of earning sympathy for all the soldiers who lost their lives in the battle of Stalingrad.

The film however is not so much about the battle and how the strategy from either side played out, but of the ordeal that these young men had to go through. After being subjected to what the viewer can only presume as much of the Third Reich's propaganda, many are eager to fight communism and uphold western Christian tradition but stronghold of brainwashing soon collapses like a brick wall of a bombed building.The production of the film is very impressive with a startlingly convincing display of the giant ruined city. Heaps of rubble, wrecked vehicles, bodies, sewers, and soon a savage winter. Humanizing the Wehrmacht has been a sort of taboo, especially in the US where German soldiers appear on screen all too often just to be shot. Some more films from more daring directors, like Peckinpah's Cross of Iron have had the guts to show the bad guys as humans caught up in a whirlwind out of their control. And not as the archetype of the evil army as the Wehrmacht is often perceived. For instance, there were no SS divisions at this battle, so politically fanatical Nazis are totally absent from this WW2 movie about the German Army... imagine that? To Americans this might come as a surprise. Now don't get all offended, your reading what an American has written.Secondly, it is not just the dreaded SS that is absent, but also iconography is not shown... or rather it just hasn't been ADDED as in movies like Enemy at the Gates have done so and, all too often, to more-than-slightly ridiculous extents. Giant swastikas on evil Nazi trains and imposing red stars on Soviet vehicles and banners... not here. HOWEVER, the Nazi swastika DOES make one key appearance - on the tail fin of a cargo plane, an outbound medical flight, the last plane out of the battleground. Wounded soldiers attempt to board the plane to be deservedly flown to safety, but in the chaos the plane leaves; the swastika leaves. The symbol that these men rallied behind to serve their country abandons them in the one moment when they need something from it. It is not just a scene of war tragedy, it is outright betrayal. And it came after the most brutal battle in all of history.Without question one of the best war films of all time. --- 9/10BsCDb Classification 13+ -- violence "},{"Title":"Truly Haunting","Date":"24 July 2008","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" I just recently saw this movie in hopes of seeing an accurate portrayal of the bloodiest battle of the 20th Century. I got what I had expected and so much more. Just to think I came across this movie by luck, before I had never even heard of it. It's a German film made in 1993 so I suppose I can't be surprised that it's almost completely unknown to the modern American audience. It's a shame cause this really is a remarkable film, I dare say that its as good if not better then Platoon, Full metal jacket, Apocalypse now, and All quiet on the western front; all of which are iconic war movies.1942 World War II is in full swing. Nazi Germany has over run Mainland Europe and parts of North Africa, then Adolf Hitler orders the full scale invasion of the Soviet Union. A fateful move that ultimately dooms Nazi Germany to defeat. In the early stages the invasion goes well and the German Armies conquer large sections of Soviet territory, but a critical battle ensues at Stalingrad, A city that hold great symbolic & strategic value. The battle soon turns into a blood bath of epic proportions, a nightmare for both the German & Russian soldiers fighting. On the verge of taking the city the Germans are suddenly counter attacked by the Russians who end up cutting off the entire German 6th Army inside Stalingrad. To make matters worse, the Russian winter arrives causing incredible suffering for the Germans. This entire battle is seen through the eyes of a few young German soldiers fighting for survival not only against the Russians and the harsh winter conditions but also against their own Sadistic officers who care only about medals & glory and the generals who have little regard for the average foot soldier.This film is going to haunt me for a while. The German Soldiers the film concentrates on are so young and naive, then their humanity & sanity are stripped from them and you really do feel sorry for them cause their not the demonic Nazi's often portrayed in film. Everything they were fighting for is no longer important, and everything they believed in was shattered, and after fighting a gruesome battle against the Russians inside Stalingrad we see them further deteriorate with the onset of Winter causing many to freeze to death. The Battle & Winter scenes were like a horrible nightmare but it also felt so real. It's amazing, in the beginning we see strapping young men in the prime of their life, and at the end they a shells of their former selves stripped of everything. After witnessing so much carnage these men just loose their will to live on, it was really sad. When there is finally a moment of hope they are betrayed by Hitler who ultimately abandons these men to a horrible death, which is just another one of Hitler's crimes abandoning the men who fought for him to be slaughtered by the Russians. A good Anti-War film depicts the horrors of war and that's what this movie does. The battle for the tractor factory sequence Is the closest thing that comes to hell on earth, but that's really what The Battle for Stalingrad was like. The German & Russian soldiers were depicted with humanity, it was only the bad apples (specifically on the German side) that doomed the men. Bottom line is this film is amazing cause we see how men breakdown physically & emotionally during war. We all have our limits and these men were pushed far beyond their limits in the most deadly battle of our time. What the average foot soldier endured at Stalingrad was beyond imagination. Even if they had survived everything they had seen & done would have scarred them for life.Stalingrad shows us why War is Hell, and what exactly hell looks like.

The war scenes aren't bad, but they don't engage the viewer as much as others, they don't create the same amount of tension or an idea of what the situation was like for real, to the extent found elsewhere(although I will admit that I could be somewhat influenced by watching this so close to Saving Private Ryan). There's no Hollywood, as such, herein, but there are one or two coincidences. The writing tends to be pretty good. The psychology isn't bad, and seems accurate. This doesn't particularly downplay any aspect of war(and does include a thing or two that aforementioned Spielberg piece did not), without anything ever being gratuitous. There is no celebration of violence(or anything else), and you are not going to get any warm, fuzzy feeling from a viewing of this. The fact that everyone speaks the actual language(not just German, also Russian) lends this a lot of credibility. The pacing could definitely use work, and the direction could be considerably more effective. The realism does have a noticeable hole or two, but it's also spot-on in places. The acting is mostly a positive aspect&#133; the only performer I recognized was Thomas Kretschman, and he does much better in his native tongue than in American, more convincing.

The viewer could sympathize with the common soldier, but was not spared the consequences of the common soldier's actions. I think they did a better job of it than most American filmmakers - we're good at portraying the violence and terror of war from the viewpoint of the soldier, but we hold back when it comes to depicting the cost to the (comparatively) innocent. Certainly, the Germans were freezing to death - and the central characters more than once saw their comrades turning Russians out to freeze to death. Certainly, the Germans were dying - and the central characters were confronted with a Russian woman grieving over two small children who had either been killed or starved or frozen to death.

A brief history of the facts behind this film have been well stated 'The Battle of Stalingrad was a major battle of World War II in which Nazi Germany and its allies fought the Soviet Union for control of the city of Stalingrad (now Volgograd) in southwestern Russia. It took place between 17 July 1942 and 2 February 1943, and is often cited as the turning point of the war in Europe. The German offensive to take Stalingrad, the battle inside the city and the Soviet counter-offensive--which eventually trapped and destroyed the German 6th Army and other Axis forces around the city--was the first substantial German land defeat of the war. The battle involved more participants than any other on the Eastern Front, and was marked by its brutality and disregard for military and civilian casualties by both sides. It was amongst the bloodiest in the history of warfare, with the upper estimates of combined casualties coming to nearly two million.' The horror of this battle as written by J√ºrgen B√ºscher, Christoph Fromm, Johannes Heide, and director Joseph Vilsmaier manages to allow us to see the 'other side' of the German forces, those not committed to the Nazi hunger for world domination, but instead were simply men serving their required time in the army, hoping to return to their families. The film opens with a prelude German troops of the 6th Army are languishing in Italy after their successful mission in North Africa. They are soon assigned to attack a port in Russia - a place called Stalingrad - and off they go to what is perceived to be another quick victory. The unit is directed by Lt. Hans von Witzland (Thomas Kretschmann, in a role that should have won him every award possible, so fine is his performance) he is a man who appears more human than soldier and indeed when his troop arrives in Russian territory he is appalled by the treatment of Russian POWs by German officers, a response that places him in a negative light with the Nazis. But Witzland is assigned to take a Russian strong hold with the close help of his group of fellow soldiers (played with extraordinary humanity by Dominique Horwitz, Sebastian Rudolph, Oliver Broumis et al). For a moment in time they are successful heroes but their commitment to the war is rapidly and fully eroded by the slaughter around them and the orders from the heinous Nazi officers to treat the Russians with less than dignity. They are threatened with death by firing squad for their humanity in attempting to give aid to the Russians being constantly attacked and only released form their prisoner status when the war appears to be aimed toward loss. There are many very tender moments between the 6th army and the Russians trapped by the siege of Stalingrad and as the bitter winter sets in the battle-weary soldiers are dying, committing suicide or attempting to escape and find their way back home. The over two hour study of the cruelty of war ends with a solemn statement, both emotionally and visually and the Battle of Stalingrad, a victory of the Russians, shows the defeat of the minds (and lives) of the Germans. The film is brave in its commitment to address the fact that the universal 'German image' of World War II is a negative one. This film focuses on individual ideals and the scarring that war, on both sides, leaves on the soldiers and people who survive it. Highly recommended. Grady Harp "},{"Title":"Right to the point.

Most of these soldiers for the Axis powers were normal people like you and I caught in a terrible conflict and just happened to be fighting for a country they loved.The Battle of Stalingrad was arguably the most lethal battles in world history with over 1,500,000 casualties sustained over the course of the battle. The film Stalingrad follows a German platoon and its leader Lieutenant von Witzland as they are reassigned to the Eastern Front to battle the Soviets at Stalingrad. Von Witzland acts as sort of the main character with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. They all are normal men and seem to be completely unaware to what is happening back in Germany and Poland.The film follows the course of the battle. The film is overall very bleak when it comes to its portrayal of combat and a soldiers life during the battle. We are shown numerous gruesome battles and intense violence outside of the battles (including a firing squad sequence). Overall the battles are the earliest examples that I know of that portray the loss of limbs and overall in your face death sequences and violence. Much of the inspiration for Saving Private Ryan's battle sequences seem to have come from this film.The film does not aim to make the German's completely innocent of everything in the film. Several of the higher ranking officers of the army are portrayed in the usual view most people are use to, evil. Most of the soldiers are just normal people who often speak of home. The film makes it clear quite quickly that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, most of the country and army was entirely oblivious to the fact that genocide was taking place. The film makes it clear that the soldiers in the Germany Army was simply fighting for a cause they really didn't understand and most wished just to return home rather than freezing in negative degree temperatures in Russia.The film really shows how hellish war is, especially World War II. The battle scenes will shock you with its gritty realism and the story is quite easy to follow as you are simply following a platoon during the battle. As with most war films do not expect much happiness after seeing it. It will leave you in a bit of a depressed mood just from seeing the life most of the soldiers on the Eastern Front faced. Not recommended for children. 4/5 stars "},{"Title":"moving historical document","Date":"28 March 2006","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" Bloody marvelous.

They were merely obeying orders from the high command as were the Russians, Americans, British, Italians, Japanese and the many other nations that participated in the war. The German soldiers as well as everyone else that fought and died for their country deserve to be respected equally whether friend or foe.Back to the movie I feel the actors did a good job of portraying the German soldiers who were broken down to the point of destruction.

It depicts the ordeals of some of the German soldiers that fought --- and died --- in and around Stalingrad during World War 2. No big time heroics, no over bearing emotional fuzziness, only the fear of every day death in war.

I had never heard about it (and I am a huge fan of the war genre) but came across this movie through another site.The first 20 minutes I was not completely sure what to make of the movie. The acting was a little 'stiff' and the introduction of the characters was not very well executed in my opinion. But as soon as they come into the city of Stalingrad itself the movie took a better turn.The battle scenes can be quite gruesome, but very realistic as well (it's not as bloody as for example Saving Private Ryan but still limbs fly over the place). At this point, the depth of the characters also becomes more important. This movie shows you exactly what happens to normal grunts (in the movie it is once said that they are not all Nazis) under extreme pressure of an ongoing and fierce battle, and how they cope with the emotional/psychological stress involved. What I liked is that it shows the battle not only from the German perspective (although most of it) but also from the defender's side, and civilians.At his point, the acting becomes very good, and I found myself wondering more than once what I would do if I was in their place. At first they are surprised that the Russians shoot their own troops considered as cowards, but they will soon realize that for them there is no viable option of retreat as well. Unless of course they want to end up as the enemy. The deprivation of sleep, food, and the stress of being in combat for months at a time is very well depicted. I can understand that some people will not like this movie, because it shows the human side of the Germans as well, and not just as savage beasts bringing terror throughout Europe (much like for example 'Der Untergang')However, this movie shows that we are ALL victims of such a terrible war, and in war the difference between right and wrong fades very fast.The ending to me was heartbreaking.

E.g., Russians have had several defeats in the post WW II period - could you imagine them picturing this? With Stalingrad 1993, Germans have crudely shown the horrors and sufferings in one of the most severe battles in the WW II, without glorifying themselves and without scoffing at their enemy. On the other hand, Soviet Russia was no innocent victim, its treatment of own and neighboring people in the 1930ies was nasty and lethal as well, and Soviet (non-)activities were largely a reason why Hitler had courage to start this horrible war.As for the movie, the events and background seem realistic (probably shot in Finland), most of actors performing Russians speak decent Russian, and leading men are catchy to follow (primarily Dominique Horwitz as Obergefreiter Fritz Reiser, Thomas Kretschmann as Leutnant Hans Von Witzland, Jochen Nickel as Unteroffizier Manfred Rollo Rohleder). However, some of the scenes could have been shortened, and direct battle scenes comprise only a small part of the movie. The ending is predictable, although the scenes leading to it are well directed. It seems that the creators wanted to combine profound human aspect with concrete battle, but for this task, the movie was too short - a miniseries could have been more appropriate. Nevertheless, if you like war movies based on real events, Stalingrad is worth watching. "},{"Title":"Best movie describing the Eastern Front, but...","Date":"2 June 2013","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" The movie has a lot of good points, as have been shown in other review.However, the battle scenes in this movie are a little bit silly in my eyes 1. At the beginning battle of the movie, the storm company (or battalion?) was tasked to overwhelm the defenders of the factory. The captain wanted to close the quarter quietly and launch the offensive without rousing the defenders. Yet, a rifle was fired unwillingly by an infantry who jumped in, which waked up the defenders and caused a lot of casualties in the attacking force. Later, the captain gave the soldier a hand-grenade to eliminate the machine-gun which is mowing down the German soldiers. That soldier just ran toward the machine-gun without much dodging movements, not even lowering his body. And he didn't get mowed down by the machine-gun.This contradicted the usual common sense. What's more, the German hand-grenade's advantage is its throwing distance, but the explosive in it is not as much as the U.S. fragmentation ones. So I am quite doubtful that a potato-masher would destroy a machine-gun pillbox, as shown in the movie. Plus, Stalingrad would not have gained its nickname Street-fight Academy if the defender's position is so easy to overthrow. In the ruins of the Stalingrad, it is impossible to imagine such a single machine-gun pillbox without supporting cross-fire from other directions. If it were that simple, the 6th Army would have captured the city long before the winter began.2. In the middle of the movie, over the snow-covered steppe, Lieutenant Witzland's platoon is ordered to hold an area where the Russian wanted to break in with their tanks. The soldiers either used Panzerfaust to give the tank a direct hit, or waited in the foxhole until the tank rolled over, and attached the ad-hoc high-explosive to its rear-engine part to break it down. After that, the infantry soldiers attached to the tank or behind it were mowed down by German MP40 or MG42.As far as I know, the usual way of fighting with a mixed mechanized formation is to let the infantry soldiers come forward to scout the hidden enemy fire positions, to expose them and let them be licked up by the up-coming tanks. No, the tanks would never thrust forward by themselves. That way, they would be easy targets for Panzerfausts or Bazookas. The tanks would go all by themselves only in very large formations, say, a tank division or a tank army. In that case, the enemy would not have a chance to come behind the leading tanks and explode them from behind - anyone who tried to do this would be mowed down by the machine-gun in the following-up tanks.In short, the movie is successful in humanizing the German soldiers fighting in Stalingrad, but it made a big mistake in over-simplifying the battle scenes and under-estimating the Russian force too much, just the same errors commit by the Fuhrer and General Staff of Wehrmacht.The Russian would not have won the Battle of Stalingrad if they fought in the way described in the movie.

For the Nazi supremacy the City of Stalingrad represented the doctrines of Bolshevism. For the Soviet Union, Stalingrad represented national loyalty, patriotism and the defence of the whole country. Subsequently, for many generations, the battle of Stalingrad carries an extensive mark of lasting psychological suffering. Most notable, the German nation. Its a striking occurrence that since Germany was unified in 1989, the first moderate budget war film produced centred on this battle in 1942.The film-makers have skilfully chronologically crafted and edited the film in several ways. To begin with, the scenes of the Warmacht relaxing in North West Italy following combat in North Africa, which resulted in them pushing back the British, Australian, New Zealand and Free-French armies. This method allows the audience a sense of calm opposing expectations before the troops are relocated to Southern Russia. During relocation, we witness the feeling of confidence instilled into the minds of the Warmacht and their future plans for Russia, once conquered. However, on arrival In Stalingrad the first images witnessed are of severely wounded and unresponsive soldiers (the ones they have been sent to replace), Russian prisoners of war being brutally mistreated and close combat soon follows. You can scene the atmosphere and their thoughts, what fate awaits them? Stalingrad succeeds in a series of scenes containing humanity-combat-brutality-morality-back to combat. The majority of these different scenes, binded together story-wise, accomplish a purpose and question the obligation of the war. Yet, some scenes are over dramatised and amiably over-tender, especially the third and final act.The director, Joseph Vilsmaier resourcefully adopts a hand-held camera method for many of the combat scenes. This method helps heighten the impending danger. Also, many combat injuries are graphical in detail. Both methods that are now so common in many modern Hollywood war films of the past 15 years, post Saving Private Ryan. The film makes the subtle conformity that is was the harsh Russian winter, lack of supplies and the deficient judgement of their high-ranking officers that defeated them.It appears the film makers are indicatively expressing the story of the war, not just the battle of Stalingrad, in this film. The rise and fall of the Warmacht, from victory to defeat, and eventually the spirit of the German nation. A principle that sub-consciously last to this day. Not that this should be misinterpreted as passing judgement on the film-makers or the German nationals, it is just a slender observation.Overall, Stalingrad is not a documentary of the titles battle, it is film, and a very virtuous one, made for dramatic presentation. The acting is good from all the cast involved, especially, Thomas Kretschmann and Dominique Horwitz as Warmacht soldiers. The production design is realistic and visionary decisive. The combat scenes express savagery and the film contains a image of sombre quality focusing on sacrifices and human interaction of a sensitive issue.

This basic plot is even central to such films as Saving Private Ryan and Platoon.Stalingrad deals with war in a much more realistic manner, and in this regard is far more comparable to the American film A Thin Red Line. What we see here is not just the intensity of combat, but one is given a sense of the bureaucratic monstrosity which war engenders, and the film thus has depressing cutscenes of trains, troops, tanks, and endless marching columns. Just as A Thin Red Line dwells upon the heat and misery of the jungle, Stalingrad focuses upon winter and famine. Meanwhile, both films portray the reality of a distraught civilian populace.Unlike most American war films which one-dimensionally portray the enemy as 'bad', Stalingrad provides a far more realistic view of blended morality, showing warcrimes committed by all sides, whilst truly good-natured and moral individuals are also seen on both sides. In the end, we are thus left with a sense of war as a senseless waste, as a struggle between corrupt leaders who exploit the naive youth who believe it is their duty to defend their country.Of course, the most controversial aspect of this film is that it deals with the Nazi movement and uses German soldiers as the protagonists. Does it thus glorify or condemn Hitler? The answer to that question will become readily apparent to anyone who watches the film. In the end, the viewer is left wondering just what any soldier could have done to avert these tragic events. What would you have done? In watching the film, you will almost certainly view at least one character trying to do exactly what you believe you yourself would have done.-Adam Rinkleff "},{"Title":"A peak into the history","Date":"21 January 2005","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" This is one of the latest films produced by Germans about the WWII. It started with DAS BOOT , where the Germans dealt with a quite delicate topic from the war ( still many families can remember lost relatives in the Battle of the Alantic, on the allied side ). And now the war in Russia. What make this movie special compared to e.g. Cross Of Iron , is German language and German actors. The film is quite close to the history. Uniforms, weapons etc. are also correct. It could be to debate that not so much time was spend on the war crime committed ( even by Wehrmact ) in Russia, but actually in Stalingrad, this was not a issue , it was pure survival for the German soldiers under siege. The cold weather,lack of everything, desperation and also the short moments in hope, is shown very good in this movie. I have talked about Stalingrad with one family member that was private in the encircled German army ( he manage to get out in last moment ). He said that he couldn't make this film better, yes more cruel - but there is no let us share his daily nightmare. But we got some of the taste. Furthermore the corrupt German high rank officers is real, and the selection between able/disable for service selection is true. So if you have any interest is WWII history and want a peek in the hell of Stalingrad, then get this movie on your TV.

Vilsmaier is not one of them. Whether he is primarily responsible for the cut of Stalingrad I just rented from Netflix or someone else perpetrated it I do not know. But what could have been an excellent film is rendered just so-so by sloppy editing, obvious caricatures, uninspired panorama shots, and a soundtrack that seems to have been dubbed after the fact.And then there is the predictable rapid-fire dialogue utterly destroying any sense of subtlety or inner tension inherent in some otherwise very good character portrayals. I do not fault the actors. Whenever they do have a chance to go deeper into an odd bit of dialogue, there seems to follow a figurative pie-in-the-face or sudden thrust in another direction entirely.I thought the fictional though contrived main plot at least equal to those of any one of hundreds of other war movies. There is nothing unique involved here -- in spite of a tendency on the part of many viewers to re-live the specific tactics or political background in which the story progresses. War is war. I first heard that expression from a German cousin of mine who lost his only son (a Wehrmacht Lieutenant) at Stalingrad, and the sad finality in his voice still echoes in my head.So, although I followed the character of Witzland (curious name, that) from beginning to end with more than a little personal identification, I vote this one no more than a high average.

The main reason is simply that it shows a piece of the war through German (albeit 1992 German) eyes, something not done in a significant way by any US-produced movie.  Even more remarkable (and commendable) is that the vast majority of the soldiers depicted are decent people and not faceless child-eating murdering Nazi thugs (as in Enemy at the Gates).  Having learned German (the subtitles are incomplete, sometimes wrong, and generally bad) the movie was made all the more enjoyable - some of the stuff just doesn't translate to English. Sure there are problems - continuity, editing, technical, etc.  But I've read now three different histories of the battle (most recently Antony Beevor's excellent book) and the movie does an excellent job of showing you a cross-section of life for German soldiers who fought, starved, froze and eventually died during the campaign while avoiding a superficial check all the boxes plot like the one in the truth-bending yet inexplicably popular Platoon. Other commentators have criticized the character development in Stalingrad, a charge just as easily directed at any film with the ambitious scope of this movie.  These comments might just as well be due to the problems of translation.  Through Lieutenant von Witzland and Captain Musk, one sees the traditional German values of honor and service; through Otto, we see the moral crisis faced by the German Army officer corps that found itself paralyzed in the face of Nazi manipulation; in the innocent GG we see the waste and loss of war.In line with other commentators, however, I have to say that I can't approve of the revisionist nature of the Stalingrad plot.  Personal accounts and letters show overwhelmingly that even the average German soldier was quite confident of victory and many in their faith in and allegiance to Hitler almost up until the end in February, 1943.  While this would have made the movie less appealing, both in Germany and elsewhere, it would have made for much better history.  One had to ask when viewing Stalingrad the same question one asks when walking the streets of modern-day Germany -- Where did all the Nazis go?

There are so many things wrong with Stal. that I could spend this review listing them. First, you have to be aware that certain words carry great promise, a promise that has to be fulfilled at the end or you'll disappoint your audience. Such is the case with Stalingrad.Most of what's wrong with Stal. comes from the approach the filmmakers took. It's clear they thought that to add up another epic to their resume all they had to do was take inland the crew of Das Boot and put them in the cauldron of Stalingrad. Big mistake. There is an enormous difference of context and nature between both cases. If there was one single clean form of war during WWII, at least in the European theater, that was the naval war. There were no Nazi atrocities, no Waffen SS, no Shoah on Atlantic waters, so any German director is free to present his characters as regular sailors doing their duty. But that stops there. Once the action moves to the Eastern front, you cannot possibly keep presenting them under the same light. We do know Germans were the bad guys in the USSR and that's good enough for me, so dramatizations of their suffering and dying over there leave me quite indifferent. I wish German directors stopped presenting their WWII soldiers as just poor guys who got a raw deal, who suffered as much as their victims and who deserve our compassion. Funny thing, I don't see them as such poor saps in stock footage, while they were winning. Also don't talk to me, please, about humanity in war. There is not such thing and that's the genius of films like Coppola's AN or Malick's TTRL they show us war as it is, as a brutal, unmitigated, carnage where men lose their souls and become bloodthirsty dogs. In Stalingrad there was no other idea in the minds of all Soviet and German soldiers than to kill as many enemies as they could. Only because of that, Enemy At The Gates is far closer to the historic truth.But the Das Boot approach is not only wrong because it distorts the historic truth but also because it deprives the flick of an appropriate set up. The Italian beaches with its relaxing German soldiers--copycat of the Boot's party&#x97;robs the opportunity for a tension creating intro, like the crossing of the Volga and the massacre of Russians in EATG. Those terrible scenes throw you headfirst into the battle, creating a sordid atmosphere which remains for the rest of the flick. You sit in awe for the length of it because you have been shaken to the bones with the raw brutality of it all&#x97;Khrushchev selecting officers to be shot, Russian soldiers being mowed down like cattle--even more so when you know all, or most, really happened.EATG has been savaged by purists for distorting the historic truth, yet it has the merit of giving us an eloquent picture of what Stalingrad really was. The ever present darkness, the sordid surroundings, the atmosphere of death and decay, the stoic--yet without any illusion about their own survival--snipers. Battle scenes in Stal. instead seem to have been shot on home plate in Yankee Stadium; they are drowning in light, which ruins the atmosphere; its only in the gutter scene that we really get the feel. Also, EATG focuses mostly on a little known, yet fascinating, episode the battle of the snipers, which makes for a far better packaged movie. Stal. instead wastes miles of film in inane bickering amongst the Germans, in futile conflicts between good and evil (the evil German is such a cartoon guy I doubt someone like that ever existed) and in skirmishes that appear staged, probably based on pictures of the real battle.Technically this is not a great flick movie either. The cinematography is standard and the directing so--so. I already mentioned the excess light. The pacing is stilted and the editing terrible. You are suddenly thrown in the midst of battle, not knowing how you got there--and as suddenly the action stops. Also, lack of continuity, some scenes just tacked there for no reason (the Russian woman with her baby). Subplots that keep popping up but lead nowhere (The Russian uncle and soldier for ex.). Stal. could have been better it focused instead on an overview of the whole battle and on Von Paulus' conflicted personality and behavior.The director took a gamble here and lost it; at least amongst those who think the Germans got what they deserved. With it settled, most of the empathy is gone. Schmaltzy scenes--let's save the boy from execution, or let's give them bread--don't ring true and instead only make things worse for the humanity in war theory. Even worse is the scene between the Russian girl and Witzland. Is she offended because he didn't rape her? Wow. Also, the battle in the snow is unrealistic. Had the Soviets fought like that they would have never won. (when attacked like that you spread out your tanks--not run them into entrenched infantry). But of course the Germans had to win, so they could last to the end of the movie. The best part, the only good one, is the ending, the unlikely trio treading through snow, going nowhere. Had the filmmakers started with that image, concept, and worked backwards this could have been a better flickIn all, interesting enough to see once but not enough to remember it. 5.5/10.

Before watching it I had read non-fiction accounts of the Stalingrad campaign and had seen a lot of documentary footage and photographs of the actual battle and its participants. I don't think that any movie can really succeed in depicting the titanic struggle and suffering that actually occurred, but I still wanted to see what a relatively recent German movie production would be like. While there are a few good elements of this movie, overall it is a failure. To me the worst aspect is that it includes substantial anachronisms, and also some very contrived and clich√©d elements, most glaringly in some encounters between a German officer and a Soviet woman.Also there are some ideological elements in the movie which result in very distorted perceptions, including what amounts to a caricature of a German chaplain, some overblown class-warfare messages, and problematic depictions of good vs. bad Germans. Certainly the German Armed Forces of World War II included men who were able to maintain some decency throughout the war, and others who did very bad things, but the attempts in the movie to show this contrast are very simplistic and childish. I give Stalingrad credit in the sense that it doesn't completely portray German troops in the simple demonic quality which is the stereotype that many people now have, yet the movie includes stereotypes of its own, such as an almost too-good-to-be-true infantryman who has attitudes more akin to the 1990's than the 1940's, and two completely evil infantrymen and a rear-echelon officer.Some recent movies such as Stalingrad and Saving Private Ryan are frequently praised for their authenticity in depicting graphic scenes of combat, yet these same movies are deeply flawed and distorted in their depictions of the attitudes, values and behaviors of 1940's soldiers and civilians. Stalingrad and S.P.R have major and minor characters who lack the unselfconscious stoicism that was common among regular people during the World War II period. Certainly soldiers throughout history have been notorious for their frequent grumbling and occasional cynicism, yet the self-absorbed, talky and touchy-feely characters in both of these movies are something else, and are much more prevalent in our world of today than they were in the 1940's. While many people these days like to denigrate war movies from the 40's and 50's which present more patriotic messages and aren't as graphic about combat, many of those earlier movies such as Battleground are much more accurate in their depictions of typical soldiers' attitudes, and they are often successful in showing the horrible effects of war in more indirect ways.One well-done part of Stalingrad is a battle between German infantry and Soviet tanks, which does a reasonable job of capturing some of the horror and confusion in such combat.Stalingrad does a poor job though of showing the common look of the frontline soldier. Part of this might be due to the difficulty in finding thin, haggard-looking extras in our pampered and well-fed America and western Europe of today. Also, too many of the German troops in the movie don't wear their uniforms and equipment properly, and don't display the professional bearing that was common in the German Wehrmacht even during the years of German defeat. If you want to get a good idea of how the actual German troops looked, I recommend the following documentaries which contain footage of the Stalingrad campaign The World at War, War of the Century and Russia's War. Also the books Operation Barbarossa in Photographs by Paul Carell, Stalingrad by Geoffrey Jukes and Stalingrad by Paul Carell contain a great many helpful photos. Books written about the battle by Antony Beevor and William Craig are recommended also, and the latter one is especially good about the common soldiers and civilians on both sides.Relatively recent movies which, in my opinion, are much better than Stalingrad and Saving Private Ryan in depicting attitudes and characters of persons during World War II, and the general feel, look, horror and grittiness of that war, are Der Untergang (The Downfall) and Talvisota (The Winter War). While A Bridge Too Far and The Longest Day cover events on the Western Front rather than in the East, they are also excellent war movies, and stick very close to factual accounts. The latter two movies lack some of the grit that is more prevalent in more recent films, but they compensate for that lack with their other strengths, including truthfulness.

One, as an American, history is very much taught in this country from an American point of view. That may not be a bad thing, but it leaves us with the impression that America won World War II. That is true in the general sense, but it was the Soviet Union that defeated Hitler. The Americans were much more involved with Japan. So to have films that focus on Russia during World War II is always good.But two, it is interesting to see films like this come out of Germany. You walk a fine line. Obviously, you want to be proud of your country and part of that is being proud of military victories. But, at the same time, you don't want to praise the Nazi regime or suggest that what they did was right. How you promote the bravery of soldiers without endorsing their fight is tough, but this film seems to make a serious effort at doing so.

It is a great example of how the army generals, the heads of the state rest in their homes and give directives to do this and that, and see it all is some sort of sacred and holy undertaking, but on the battlefield it is bloody, it is scary and not to be glorified in the first place.The film is a very sad one.... It hits you with reality. It revolves around soldiers who are tired of the nonsense, want to go home, be with their families and are looking for ways and excuses to escape from the horror. Their conscious does not bother them, it does not call them cowards, for above all they are humans first, like us, they do not want to be killed and tortured, they do not want to play with blood all the time. This is the reality, heroes-like soldiers is greatly imaginary. The ending scene where they die in the cold is one of the saddest scenes that I have ever watched. It had such sever after-effects on me that I thought of this all night.

The young lieutenant is going through a change of perspective when he comes face to face with death and war, he's loosing his close friends, realizes the pointless battles, the corruption within higher ranked officers, the powerless generals who blindly follow orders from above and seeing everyone as numbers. This is how he looses faith for his country, his people, his army and the identity he once carried proudly in his stripes is now lost as he tries to survive the cruel winter in the front.

I am pretty interested in politics though, but the depiction of actual battle scenes has never done too much for really. Luckily, this film is more than that. During its over 2 hours it does not only show bloody fights, but also delivers pretty good character evaluations and a smart approach to the idea of how to depict the very well-known fact that war is evil. This is about the battle of Stalingrad, maybe the most known battle in World War II, because it basically destroyed Germany's hopes of winning the War. It is the Russian winter in this case and the fact that German soldiers just weren't ready to deal with the heavy climate conditions. A bit of an irony that it happened right at the city that is named after the Russian leader at that time. But lets get back to the film. The director is Joseph Vilsmaier and at least people with an interest in German films should know him. He has worked in film since the very early 1970s and was also a co-writer with a couple other guys for this film here. The cast includes some known names, but nobody really where you would say oh it's him. The most known of these today, almost 25 years later is probably Sylvester Groth. The only significant female character is played by Vilsmaier's wife Dana Vavrova, who sadly died far too young from cancer. This is certainly one of Germany's best (anti-)war films and if you appreciate the genre more than I do, you may actually have a pretty great time watching this one. The acting is fine, the character are relatable and memorable and it's really well done by Vilsmaier so that we can watch a credible tale of how they were not only struggling with their enemies, but also with other people in the German army and as a whole with their lives (as soldiers) in general.

This is probably as many here say the best movie ever made on WWII.We're very far from the eternal Hollywoodian productions, with more or less happy endings, carefully edited not to shock ears or eyes with crude words or views. Joseph Vilsmaier goes straight to the facts. Even if the beginning with its views of the beaches of Italy gives an impression of gradation to the subject, we're very quickly confronted to the reality of what was to happen young guys who would prefer to be attending their everyday life with families and friends and brought into a storm by a megalomaniac scoundrel named Hitler.The best example of this is the huge lie of the general in the scene at the beginning of the film when he states that Germany has been victorious at El Alamein!All along the movie, we can feel the sense of betrayal of the battalion and Hans. It's a huge crescendo just as the horrors of the situations lived by those men increases. Another aspect of the way the film is shot, is at the same time a terrible sense of loneliness. Progressively each character transmits to the audience this terrible feeling of being abandoned to fate and elements i.e. the climate. The director and the writer have made a fantastic analysis of the human nature and its reaction to this terrible trauma. And you cant help thinking, how would I react in such circumstances?.Joseph Vilsmaier has succeeded not to drop in the great mistake of Jean-Jacques Annaud's version of Stalingrad (Enemy at the gate) which is the relative happy ending. Whatever the facts you depict in a movie treating of this battle, there cant be a positive or happy ending for any of the protagonists. A simple figure attests of it it is estimated that of the 100000 German POW only 5000 survived and returned to their country.This is a great movie, and each adolescent should view it to keep in its memory what the so called superiority of a nation can be driven to if by nationalistic propaganda it is driven to expansionism.This is true on any continent, whether America, Europe or Asia. History repeats itself whether we like it or not and there is always somewhere a mad man to exploit economic circumstances leading to such horrors. France and England have had a huge responsibility in the arrival of Hitler because of the stupid Versailles treaty and the way we ruined the German economy opening the gates to hatred on one side and credulity of a starving nation to the propaganda and lies of its filthy new leader in the 30s.

Impeccable acting, direction and photography create a powerful depiction of war at its most miserable, futile and degrading.But I do think two mild criticisms need to be stated.First, a movie titled Stalingrad ought to present at least some vague overview of that historical battle. Aside from a few confusing references to the wider tactical situation, this move sticks to a worms-eye view. After a while, you even have to wonder whether the travails of this particular group of soldiers are at all typical of the huge German force involved at the time. The film works as drama, but if you call it simply Stalingrad, I think you're promising a bit of historical context.Second, the pace is a tiny bit over-drawn. In the last third of the film, I reached an atrocity overload, where further horrors had progressively less impact. I began to disconnect from the characters, remaining only mildly curious as to what agonizingly tragic ways would be found to dispatch them. A stronger dramatic hook is needed, to pull us through the admitted hopelessness of this last segment.These are far from fatal flaws. It's more a question of balance. A bit more context, a slightly tighter narrative, and this could have been a masterpiece. As it is, I'd say it's a really excellent film, that does show - unforgettably - how war deadens the soul, even if it fails to kill the body.Still, I have to hope that other filmmakers will one day present a broader view of the battle of Stalingrad. There's still lots of historical ground that needs to be covered, if future generations are to understand the madness that created this nightmarish conflict.

At times, I found the sub-par acting by extras and use of stock sound effects really killed the depth of a scene. I also found that I couldn't keep a track of which characters were which, this may have been due to similar faces and language barriers creating trouble with indistinguishable accents. Between scenes, there would be such large gaps in time that you wouldn't be able to tell how a situation arose or what the situation was in some cases, making the story hard to follow. These factors limited my ability to feel the exhaustion and suffering of the characters, and left me slightly disengaged.The reason for my high mark, however, is attributed to the final scenes. The raw emotion coming from the few remaining actors is highly visible on this precious smaller scope, and the eventual plight of each character is played out in such devastating detail that I sat in silence in a dark room long after the credits had finished rolling and felt compelled after to even write some poetry.If you came to this film to see the struggle of a battle, you could do better, but stick around for the ending, it's very much worth it.

For the most part, the characters which was most unforgettable to me was the battle hardened Corporal Fritz Reiser (enacted by Dominique Horwitz) and the inexperienced idealistic Platoon Leader Lieutenant Von Witzland (brilliantly performed by Thomas Kretschmann).As said earlier this Movie has only two major battle scenes, one happens within the Factory Compound at Stalingrad and the other one is a well portrayed Soviet Mixed Tank Infantry Offence on a prepared German Positions. Action scenes were well executed and since there was less amount of CGI it was realistic. Note this movie was five years prior to 'Saving Private Ryan' and taking into consideration that I would say the special effects were really good.

Russia won and cracked the Wehrmacht in more ways than one at this turning point. Russia always had a higher body count, at least until near war's end, because they used their infantry as cannon fodder, and civilians added to the count. Russia could keep throwing bodies at the Germans, but the Germans couldn't sustain such a loss as the Russians finally pulled off a pincer movement of their own.Although the battle includes entire armies, it is small unit action that is on the screen. Platoons and companies, sometimes a battalion. Except for a few recurring characters, largely anonymous actors come and go on the screen. This has been criticized but that is what large scale war is; an anonymous action of brutal firepower where combatants are routinely blown up, ripped apart and smashed. Survivors keep their sanity by a crude apathy about their fate, only occasionally breaking down when a foxhole buddy, a long-lived survivor finally gets eliminated. Such a loss is hard for them to take.Stalingrad is not the goriest war movie I've ever seen but there's enough. The segment through the sewers was more disturbing for me to watch. Gah! I also think the horrible winter conditions were done well. All in all I'm very glad I've never had to suffer all the extreme hardships almost everyone there had to.Almost everyone except the elite, of course. The movie just dances around that fact a bit, but the truth is even under the worst conditions the leadership managed to keep themselves relatively well cared for. General Paulus did not have to walk to Siberia; he became a showpiece for Stalin, and to his dying day cursed Hitler for not allowing him to retreat and save his men. Its a big What-if in history as how that might have changed the course of the war. As it was, only about 6,000 of the German POWs made it back alive after the war from this battle.The movie has a detached feel to it which I think is deliberate, to give the sense of what war is like. But as a result, you don't feel engaged with the actors on the screen. I don't think Stalingrad has a high replay value. You get a taste of what such a bitter battle might be like, but who wants such a bitter experience more than once? It's a good movie to see once.The DVD has both original German and English dub audio. I watched the subtitles because I wanted to hear the actors on the screen even if I didn't know what they actually all said.

The film was in no way a glorification of conflict and the actors and director showed great art in demonstrating the evil and tragedy that Stalingrad surely was in 1942-43. No punches were pulled on the death of soldiers , the scene where the German soldier is killed by a T34 shows that , only too well. The direction of the film , showed the political division between SS and Whermacht ,officers and soldiers alike.The SS were of course brutal and corrupt , but the director tried to display the ordinary soldier as brave and honourable...Im not suggesting that they were n't , but not having any experience of warfare of any kind , I can well imagine that war is and will always remain a brutalising experience...The Battle of Stalingrad more so. The film was and remains a German point of view in a deadly struggle and all-round was brilliant , except perhaps the ending.

The best scenes involve the mid stages of the battle, in the bombed out ruins of the city--although they don't explain to us that it was the Germans who bombed the city to ruins, making lots of places for Soviet soldiers and guerillas to hide.  The scenes of woundings and amputations in the improvised sewer hospital are quite horrifying, also. My problem with the movie is its lack of details of the campaign.  How did the German army get surrounded?  The Soviets launched Operation Uranus, but that is not explained in the film.  Hitler's stubborness and unwillingness to let his soldiers surrender is also not explored very well, and this is a very significant aspect of the battle of Stalingrad.  We also see the soldiers suffer, however, it is not done effectively enough.  The film also doesn't explain why the battle of Stalingrad was so important--this film could have been the same almost anywhere on the eastern front, during winter. If you're interested in the war, then you might as well see it.  Hopefully we will someday see a film from the Russian point of view of this battle.

As to accuracy - the friend who dragged me into it despite my distaste for blockbusters - noted that they even had the different boot height of the officers vs enlisted men right.

But Full Metal Jacket, whose battle scenes (specially the ones in an abandoned factory) really resemble some of the scenes in this motion picture, looks photographically and cinematographically much more convincing, attractive, engaging.  Also, the characters seem just too much alike one each other, very well shaven and clean cut.  I don't know the details of the siege, and maybe it is true that all german soldiers were required to be well shaven at all times, so I cannot comment on this seemingly unrealistic detail.  On the positive side, I enjoyed the multitude of languages spoken in the movie, German and Russian.  I also encourage the idea of having a war movie seen from the german soldier's perspective, something to think about in the overwelming multitude of American GI movies.  Have japanese film makers come to the point of making a movie in a lost battle where Japanese soldiers are decimated?  It could be interesting.

This film speaks about the potential trap of our own system when things go wrong and there is no way out at the level of the individual. This film is about  the character of Russia formed from the inhuman tundra in winter, and what it means to slowly freeze to death without shelter wandering a hostile wasteland in the darkness of winter. This film shows the inhuman coldness as a metaphor of our own blatant denial of our own individuality for the sake of professionalism and following orders- as much as for a lack of reason as for a mere lack of heat. This film shows the real victims of modern chivalrous warfare- defenseless civilians in their homes. This film shows a ragged bit of love crushed as a simple matter of course within this context, and that's more timely and far scarier than some chapter of military history.

The efforts of the Russians to hang on to the slightest strip of Stalingrad, ferrying troops back and forth through pack ice in the frozen Volga under German artillery and machine gun fire is never depicted. Taking this view, both groups were equally victims the Germans of Hitler's crazed desire to take 'Stalin's city', the Russians of Stalin's ruthless determination to deny the prize.By failing to show the scale of the battle, and in its one-sided view of those involved, the film is diminished and fails to live up to the promise of its subject.

I rank this one among the best war films I have ever seen. It details the horrific events of history's ugliest battle from its bloodiest war. The battle for Stalingrad left one million dead, and this brilliant movie shows it all from the point of view of the German Sixth Army.

Fresh from their previous victories, the members of the Sixth Army believe they are in for a relatively easy win. However, as the fighting grows more turbulent, the city quickly becomes a hell populated by the piles of the dead. Of course, the suffering doesn't really commence till the Russian winter sets in.Showing this gruesome conflict from the German point-of-view has many purposes. Firstly, to show just how quickly the tide of a military campaign can shift, even for a superpower. Secondly, it is easy for people of the modern era to forget the suffering on both sides. Soldiers have since the beginning of time been nothing more than the tools of politicians (regardless of the government) to cement their goals. The themes are quite relevant, and the story of these men a sheer tragedy.

Movies and documentaries showing the German perspective realistically and objectively during World War II are far too rare outside of Germany; there is Das Boot and there is Stalingrad. Perhaps misled by the title, one reviewer complained that Stalingrad did not show the Russian perspective. For that, short of a Midway type movie of dual nationality production, there are documentaries. But I think this movie gave some sense of the Russian experience. I have already seen some documentaries on Stalingrad and the German invasion of Russia, so I understood what was going on here. At some point, you need some historical background, before or after watching it.You can't expect any one movie to fully cover even a limited topic like the German-Russian battle in Stalingrad. Movies must focus. But they can also use this limited subject to convey some larger truths. That's what Stalingrad does.Stalingrad is not about this particular battle. It is a proxy for the German soldier's experience in World War II. When all was going well, some were content to become the rulers of the world. But these were human beings, and Germany, before Hitler took over, was as civilized and cultured a country in the world. What were the soldiers thinking? How could they do it? Stalingrad attempts to answer these questions.To say that Hollywood could not make a movie like Stalingrad is wrong, but this particular movie needed to be made by Germans. For anyone else to attempt to tell the story of the German experience would lack authenticity. We don't see the full, graphic German atrocities against the Russian people, though we see hints of it. And we see what happens to a German officer who protests. Protest too much and you won't be around to protest again. Don't shoot your victim in the firing squad, and next time you will be the victim. But Stalingrad is not just about Nazi Germany's army. You could put a person of any nationality into this situation, and how differently would they behave? Not much. Why do any soldiers continue to fight for a cause and a leader they know to be wrong and insane? Sometimes they have no choice, but sometimes they really believe. The old Germany was very authoritarian. The new Germany (and probably all of Europe) has been inoculated against such blind obedience. But how many other countries have an authoritarian streak? I see plenty in Asia and the Middle East. I can imagine certain countries dragging their military into war, and their soldiers obeying. You want to see what war looks like, without the glory? Watch Stalingrad.Stalingrad is a fine movie and a valuable contribution by Germany to understanding the war. But where are the German documentaries, produced with similar objectivity and honesty, available outside of Germany?

My problem with this movie is that I think it wanted me to be sympathetic to the suffering of the German soldiers, but my knowledge of what they were fighting for prevented that. There is one scene where a soldier, Otto, heaps abuse on a general, who says I am not a Nazi. Otto comments that it is perhaps worse that they, the generals, could see that Hitler is a madman and yet they dutifully support him, i.e. the sane must stand up to insanity. I think that reflects my feeling towards these characters At some point you have to look at what you are doing and say this isn't right, or why am I going into someone else's house to kill them, though I know that certainly wasn't part of the German military culture, particularly under a Fascist regime, and certainly more difficult for the foot soldier to do. I have more sympathy for the youngest German soldiers, who might not have the maturity to pose such questions to themselves. I think the movie has value, therefore, in demonstrating the feeling of waste and pointlessness if you DON'T ask yourself questions about why you are killing. By not asking themselves the right questions about their invasion, they got death without any feeling of nobility in their cause. I think my feeling towards the German soldiers in this movie were different than, say, All Quiet on the Western Front because of who and what they were fighting for. Yes, Germans invaded France in WWI, and as invaders they also got what they deserved, but the nature of the cause would have been harder for the soldiers to determine, and thus answering their own question about why they did it more difficult. In AQotWF, it was very clearly a nebulous cause, somewhat like Vietnam in that sense, but Germans in WWII had a clearer idea of who and what they were fighting for, and thus deserve less sympathy.For such a long movie that looked at things from the point of the average soldier, I would have liked to have seen the exploration of these issues, perhaps by drawing the characters and plot a little better. For the most part in this movie, we just watch the soldiers suffer in various ways. This does have value is showing what war is, however.Now, when are we going to get a good movie that tells things from the Russian point of view?  After all, they suffered the greatest losses (20 million dead on their own territory), which was all but invisible in this story. The Russians were also the ones who smashed most of Hitler's forces, and without whom the other Allies would never have succeeded (fortunately for all of us, Hitler went against the advice of his General Staff and started Barbarosa too late in the year, so the Russians were lucky in that respect). Now that the Cold War is over, I hope it's realistic to see a movie made that gives them the appreciation they deserve.

The lessons of the previous winter defeat in the attack on Moscow were not learned.

It lacks the precise imagination needed to reinvent history and make it look real. Everything here has been done before in other movies, and usually much better. The gotterdamerung street battle in the first half looks like parts of APOCALYPSE NOW, over-lit, garish, and literally over-orchestrated, carried along by constant music. (Coppola, of course, was making a point about Viet Nam which is hardly relevant here.)The sewers sequence adds nothing to this sub-genre. How effective this scene could have been if the characters had just been illuminated by small flames, and then, when one of them gunned a flame-thrower, suddenly the vast cavern would be revealed in a brief glimpse. But, no, the sequence is totally floodlit in rainbow colors, like a Pennsylvania cave tour. How thoughtful of the Stalingrad city council to fully light all their sewers!The significance of the battle of Stalingrad is that more soldiers died in this battle than any other; one million Russians died, and the entire German Army of 400,000 was wiped out. Yet here we have the impression that the battle was fought by a small group; everywhere they go the protagonists seem to meet the same people. It particularly strains credulity that the Russian girl they meet in the sewers shows up later. In this respect (and others) it's reminiscent of THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE, a massive operation reduced on film to a cavalry mission. It seems odd that in a battle where an entire army perished, the emphasis in the end is on two people alone on a vast landscape.Another troubling thing is that though the German army is surrounded, apparently getting out and returning home is an option if one wants to crap out.The film shows little imagination, and repeats all the standard dramatic tricks of other war films (both in the action sequences and the interminably talky ones), which results in the failure of the filmmakers' expressed purpose, to show that there is no glamour of war by choosing as their subject a battle with massive casualties.

And still, there has been made only two big movies about it this one and Enemy at the gates. Compare to the number of Vietnam-movies, and you'll see, that something is missing here. Stalingrad tries to capture a bit of the carnage as seen through the eyes of four german (not nazi, of course) soldiers. It doesn't really succeed. If you take a brilliant Vietnam movie like Apocalypse Now, it gives a much more vivid picture of what happends to ordinary men under extreme conditions. That is what war-movies should. Not just roaring battle-scenes, screams and explosions. But the way humans act, when they are confronted with something they cannot absorb. Stalingrad tries so hard to show the horror of the war, but since its characters are as one-dimensional and shallow as they are, we never really experience, what the ordinary german landser must have experienced in the cold, doomed city. If you want a good personal account of the war on the eastern front, read The forgotten soldier by Guy Sajer. If you want good history, reed Stalingrad by Anthony Beevor.

It came with English subtitles and - although usually a hindrance - within 5 minutes I had forgotten. The dialogue was simple and terse. It was easy to keep reading apace with scene changes. That is something the French invariably forget. It opens in Italy in the peaceful, barmy sunshine and the drunkenness of soldiers on extended leave. They are bawdy and crude like the crew of 'Das Boot', and I sometimes get the impression from both that vulgarity is used as a cheap substitute for more intelligent script. The colours are beautiful. The clear blue sky finds even deeper shades of reflection in the sea. Italy is still untrammelled by allied assault and the towns are mellow and picturesque. But the movie is called 'Stalingrad', and you know this is the calm before the storm. Their leave ended, the troops are shoe-horned into cattle trucks and head east. Through the soldiers eyes, the camera shows the unfolding landscape of conquered territories - the new lebensraum. They sneer at local peasants and sit in awe of endless flat vistas of the steppes. It's their land now; or so they think. But the conquest has come to a grinding halt at the city of Stalingrad. And it's a battle that neither side can afford to lose. The movie changes here. The sun is gone. The sky turns permanently leaden. Life assumes the military colours of rancid filth. The scenes of combat are hideously graphic. In one exchange a soldier is blown in half by a tank shell. His torso pleads briefly for help. The situation deteriorates and winter finally crushes what little life and hope is left. The disintegrating order is extremely harrowing. The makers have recreated its chaos and despair with astonishing conviction. It is easy to moralise. The Germans got what they deserved. Or they were young men just obeying orders. And so on. The suffering was indescribable, but Stalingrad was a necessary evil. It was here, if anywhere, that the third Reich broke its heart. If there had been a German victory, the Russians would have been expunged en masse. Heaven knows, as things were, Nazi murder squads slaughtered more than could be counted. And sooner or later, Hitler would have returned to the matter of that inconvenient little island just north of France. By then he might have had the atom bomb.There has been a quiet attempt amongst some intelligentsia to rehabilitate the German people of this time. As if their suffering justified recognition, and from recognition - sympathy. We see a similar presentation in 'Das Boot', where submariners are ultimately depicted as victims - victims who sent thousands of ships and merchant sailors to the bottom of the sea, cheering as they did so and boasting about the 'happy times' before Britain developed effective counter-measures and paid them off in the same coin. However tragic the war for the German people and their armed forces in defeat, any prospect of their victory would have been a calamity too great to contemplate.Those who watch Stalingrad and feel an up-welling of compassion for its idealistic and doomed young Germans, should watch 'The Holocaust' afterwards.

In a real sense, the battle's outcome was determined even before it began. When Russia was first invaded, the Russians moved many of their strategic factories by railroad into far Easter Russia, out of danger from German aircraft. The factories were reassembled and began 24/7 production of war materials. Workers included men women and children, some very young, who labored up to two, or more, shifts a day. The Soviets amassed millions of first line troops troops as far away as Siberia, training and waiting for a counter offensive. Huge numbers of new tanks (notably the T-34) and airplanes were built and held in reserve. It would be only a matter of time until German armies crumbled before the Soviet might sweeping towards the Fatherland. In fact, Stalin repeatedly asked both Roosevelt and Churchill to open an second front so his armies could begin. He had to wait for over a year. The Russians had more and better food at Stalingrad than their enemy, and legend has it that each Russian soldier had two hot meals a day, with meat that was supplied by herds of sheep and cattle which followed the armies westward. Many of the troops (both men and women)were armed with automatic weapons. In Stalingrad, the Russians sharpened their shovels as weapons for hand-to-hand combat. The Germans, on the other hand, were poorly supplied over a long 2000 kilometer supply line, a line which was constantly interdicted at various points. Bolt-action rifles and fewer automatic weapons were the order of the day. Light-weight uniforms were miserable in the Russian winter. Food was scarce and miserable. The list goes on. Suffice it to say, the Germans violated too many rules of modern warfare.The major tragedy of Stalingrad, as indicated in this film, is that the German soldier had no knowledge of the Soviets's power, and little appreciation of their resolve. The major virtue of this movie is that the horror and suffering is well-illustrated. Even then the misery is understated. I recommend this film highly as a beginning for further study.

The Germans, who attacked Russia and planned to starve millions of them!It's true that many portrayals of Nazi Germany portray them as complete evil and not even human.  It has swung to such an extreme, the Nazi's have almost become a cartoon cliche and when you see the boots and uniforms, you can become detached from their humanity and it can alienate you from the fact that these are real people.  It makes them nonhuman and that can be a great peril because they are so evil, it can make you think that the danger is past and cannot come again.  So I am not for a total evil incarnate image of the Germans- I'm not talking Hitler- there may have been people who were AS evil as Hitler, but I surely don't think there's ever been someone who has been MORE EVIL - and surely he's the most evil man who ever held the power to back it up.

It features the war and conflict of Stalingrad during the WW2, and I presume it requires germans to do it, to get rid of the constant-always english talking germans and russians. Here we are presented to screaming russians, bloody  coats of germans, evil generals and hungry civilians. It starts out a little bit too slow and weak, but as I started to feel dizzy and tired about the piece itself, it slightly developed into some more action-filled story with combat scenes in Stalins pearl in the Sovjet Union, Stalingrad.If you don't have anything better to do and you like war with effects who's less expensive than effects in other war movies, such as Saving Private Ryan, well then I'll guess you can give it a shot. 4/10 "},{"Title":"Love Camp 7 without the naked ladies","Date":"23 February 2011","Score":"3 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, War","Review":" Any fan of Italian Naziploitation films will be able to catch the similarities not long into the film. The Germans are a bunch of scared incompetent idiots, and they brutalise their fellow German soldiers for no apparent reason. One iconic scene follows a gun battle in which they successfully capture a Russian factory, we then see a German soldier saying to his comrades I could not take it, I $hat my pants, to which another German soldier replies You are not the only one!! Kinda makes one wonder how did they take over most of Western Europe and were a few hundred miles away from Moscow if they were some retards who $hit their pants on regular basis? Also during the whole movie Germans were being bullied by their sadist superiors for no reason other than the kick of it.Acting was so bad it was almost sad, and battle scenes were something out of a Toho Godzilla movie to say the least. There was a scene in which we were shown that soldiers on both sides are still humans who have feelings, nice, but then there was another one, then another, and yet another that I just gave up and stopped counting when it became one huge cheese festival. There were gaps in the plot, and at times there was no plot at all that it felt as if I was watching a different movie. The extras were horrible too and bad direction was showing in scenes with large masses a scene where wounded Germans were fighting for a place on the last plane home, you can see one of the extras looking at the camera and smiling! And that was not an extra far in the back, he was in the centre of the shot just two feet from the camera!! The only plus of this movie was the use of accurate period pistols and rifles.Otherwise it is a cheap TV like Naziploitation movie in every sense of the word, except that there were no exposed boobies in here to make it even slightly bearable.

The answer, it depends. Battle scenes take up only a small portion of Stalingrad's running time (two sequences, adding up to just under fifteen minutes total), so these cheesy segments alone can't really bring the film down to complete garbage. But considering how the film fails on every other level, the battle scenes are really just another icing on the cake that dooms Stalingrad as a war film debacle.The story is pretty basic and does little to distinguish itself from most war movies out there. We follow a German platoon as they head into Stalingrad, and follow them through each deadly situation they encounter. Each of these men begin as respectable citizens, but by the end, virtually lose their grip on humanity. Actually, the title might mislead some viewers who think they're going to be seeing a film about the bloody battle of Stalingrad. Like Enemy at the Gates (a mediocre but superior production), the city is used as a backdrop for the catastrophic tides of war.What's wrong with the movie? Okay, just for a moment, ignore the fact that the violence looks like something out of a 60's spaghetti western (the gore wounds look like rubber, the bullet wounds actually sometimes spew sparks instead of blood, so on and so forth). Now we focus on all the other scenes, which as some viewers have noted, are meant to create a hopeless, downbeat feeling. But director Vilsmaier has yet to learn that for such a depressing edge to work, you have to populate your film with three-dimensional characters that are worth caring for, and Stalingrad has none (keep in mind, one guy comes close).Stalingrad displays virtually none of the same qualities as immeasurably superior character-driven war films such as The Killing Fields or Gallipoli, though it certainly aspires to. The acting is second-to-third-rate, with characters who do little to define and differentiate themselves from everyone else. Let's see, there's the up-and-coming Lieutenant, the Guy Who's Afraid His Wife is Cheating on Him, and a few other guys who make zero impressions. The actor who plays the Lt., Thomas Kretchsmann, comes close to creating a genuine persona, but he's hampered by a screenplay that replaces real personalities with cliches. Stalingrad features many other terrible aspects, such as the cheap and obvious sets, the grating musical score, and the general feeling that this is a movie, and not a genuine, harrowing experience, probably the most damning flaw the film bears. Rarely for a moment did I actually feel I was in the the thick of the war-torn city streets or the snow-covered tundras, a detachment caused by all the problems I listed throughout the entire review.Despite all that's incredibly wrong with the film, the conclusion almost works. The ending alone, a horrifying display of how seemingly inescapable the second world war was, almost creates visceral emotion on the basis of just how cruel and ironic it is (once again, could have been even more effective with great characters)(see Gallipoli for a truly nightmarish, heartbreaking finale). It's during these last few moments that, finally, Vilsmaier shows a competent hand at direction and shows us what he intended the whole time. It's just too bad it took over two hours to get there, and the trip beforehand isn't worth it.

To even mention it along with Platoon or Full Metal Jacket is absurd. The battle sequences are pathetic, the dialog and acting atrocious.This so called group of storm troopers are regulars in the Wermacht. Not SS troops. There is so much wrong with this movie it's sad. Bad editing, bad acting. It's got it all.The movie goes on and on and on as though the audience should be made to suffer as much as the soldiers did.I read in a review that the this film had a $20 million budget.For real? Where was it spent? In the fake train car sequences? In the pathetic special effects? Ugh.As a WWII history buff, and WWII movie fan, I found this movie to be a serious disappointment.For an excellent alternative war movie check out The Beast. (Not a WWII movie, but still outstanding)Don't bother with this one.  "},{"Title":"Meh.

It was too long and seemed at least mildly disjointed (granted, I didn't pay full attention...).  For a more entertaining depiction of the battle of Stalingrad, see Enemy At The Gates.  True, some pretentious folks will scoff because it's a Hollywood film, and doesn't show the gritty reality of war like this wonderful foreign film does, but it has better flow and is all around just more fun to watch.  Besides, there are already enough contrivedly gritty war movies, and this one just seemed amateurly done.  But hey, you might like it, so go right ahead; it just wasn't for me.

I hoped for something along similar lines -- a realistic war movie, portraying soliders and civilians on both sides as real people, with both the joy and pain of combat.Unfortunately, Stalingrad appears to have been written by a third grader and directed by a fifth-grade student. Major pieces of the movie simply appear missing, leaving it completely disjointed. The dialogue in translation is ridiculous, but appears no better in the native tongue; you only have to watch the actors' faces during the bad moments of dialogue to realize just how bad this movie is.

This is without a doubt a low-class B movie.  The German elite StormTroopers assault Russian bunkers en masse like an old WW1 battle. The acting is mediocre, the plot thin and threadlike. It's hard sometimes to follow where it's going. The action sequences are pretty worthless (when it shows any), except for the fact that they do use authentic equipment/vehicles from WW2. This is in NO WAY on the same level as Saving Pvt. Ryan or Platoon. Lots of worthless attempts at character development, which lead nowhere. Old theme good officer/bad officer that's highly predictable. Even the action sequences look like a 12yr old kid set them up. I could have directed better. Too bad this is the same guy that did Das Boot (The Boat), because that was a dang good movie. He must have partied too much after that success because he sure lost his touch when it came to this film. I bought it on DVD, better to rent it instead. "}]
