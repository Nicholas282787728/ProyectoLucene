In fact, to put it bluntly I totally loathe them. (I prefer movies that at least try to have a cohesive plot line with a reasonably accessible story idea and some decent tight pacing; ie something that's both informative and fun. This is my interpretation of the classic idea of a good story, well told.)With that in mind, I wish to state that this movie (film, whatever) really does work, at all levels. It's a good intelligent story (apparently based on fact about a very bright, very young kid who is discovered to be naturally good at chess and enters the serious national tournaments. During which time, there are raised issues of the concept of the winning ethos; and keeping (or losing) your humanity in the process.This cast is magnificent here. The central leads are played by Joe Mantegna and Max Pomerance as the father and son respectively. Both give very well-balanced performances. Sensitive, without being sappy. Max in particular is very good, especially in the dramatic climax of the film; which he handles with total dignity. It could have been so over the top and patronizing in lesser hands, but this time it isn't.They are ably supported by Laurence Fishburne and Ben Kingsley as two different types of coaches, from opposite side of the tracks (sorry for that old cliché). It may seem formulaic, but in this case the dramatic contrasts works surprisingly well, and both come over as intelligent representatives of their particular points of view. And there are also great character moments by David Paymer QUIZ SHOW, MR Saturday NIGHT, etc and Hal Scardino THE Indian IN THE CUPBOARD as well.Over all, I would highly commend this film as the type of story that manages to tread the fine line between intelligent ideas and an entertaining story. I recommend it to everyone. Give it half a chance and it can work for you. It really is a great example of intelligently entertaining!

At the same time, this world of this film exhibits a resilience against its crueler realities that most of the art of the twentieth century eschewed in favor of probing the darkness of existence.  Yes, the main characters are prosperous, but the spectre of Fischer hangs over the world as a daunting warning of things to come.  The mood of the piece, enhanced by the excellent cinematography, sets the film up to succeed wonderfully, and the actors and text deliver.One of the things I like the most about this movie, superficially, is that it does not insult the game of chess as it depicts it.  The depiction of the chess world is insightful and accurate, from the sharp division between granite-hewn chess scholars and colorful tactical wizards to the truly unequaled awe and gravity accompanying the notion of the Grandmaster. Perhaps these are things that can only truly be appreciated by those who have ventured to this world, but, thankfully, the film integrates these elements seamlessly into a universal story that is original and poignant in its detail and elegance.Every actor in this film is spectacular, without exception.  That is a bold statement, but it is completely justified.  At no point do any of the actors miss a step; all the performances are smooth and appear to be utterly effortless.  In their featured roles, Ben Kingsley and Lawrence Fishburne put in performances that match in art, craft, and intensity, if not in length, any of their more prominent film roles.  Joan Allen is mind-bogglingly wonderful, considering how precise she has to be to fit such a massive character into such a truncated part in the script.  This is Joe Mantena's very finest performance, and, of course, this movie contains child acting to match any film ever made.  Even the bit parts are acted with intensity, depth, and elegance.  A lot of this is easy to miss because, on the surface, the film is so even-handed, but repeated viewings continually bring to attention wonderful nuances of these performances.Any summary or synopsis will fail to accurately relate the message of this film; as in any great work of art, the quickest, most efficient way to word the resolution of the film's ideas and conflicts is to watch the film. This is where _Searching for Bobby Fischer_ really shines.  There is no way these characters could have ended up where they are from any other sequence of events than the one that took place; this is a wonderful example of how a plot is woven into a story rather than imposed on it.  The flipside of this is that there is extremely little to be found in this film that can be applied universally without reservation, and yet it still manages to be convincing.  There is something mysterious about this movie that rises toward the staggering mysteries of life, and repeated viewings are really the only means toward a full understanding of these ideas.Undoubtedly, this is the best film made in the 1990s based on a true story (if you, like me, discount _Schindler's List_ from such assessments.  It hardly seems fair to compare _Schindler's List_ to any other film due to its unique purpose.).  If you have not seen it, I highly recommend it.  It may just change your life.

My favorite scene is when Bruce(Kingsley) is teaching Josh(Pomerac) the dynamics of chess, and when the camera flips back and forth between the chess pieces, each time building up the conversation, and going up the ladder of significant pieces. Powerful scene, with powerful lessons.I also enjoy that if you don't have much of an interest in chess, that it still keeps you capitvated. I wasn't as interested in chess until I saw this movie.

I can't say merely director's work because he also wrote the screenplay. And (I have to presume) he chose Conrad Hall as d.p., James Horner for the music, Wayne Wahrman as film-editor, and he worked with a lighting director, sound director, set director and more -- each of whom did a job worthy of the highest praise. And the cast, the supernal cast -- many of whom have had larger and more celebrated roles, but none of whom has ever nailed a role more satisfyingly -- Kingsley, Mantegna, Allen, Fishburne -- even the smaller and cameo bits are effectively faultless -- by Linney, Stephens, Shalhoub, Pendleton. And of course, Pomeranc's work is a kind of miracle. Every part of it evokes from me applause for Zaillian's imagination, sensibility, knowledgeability, intelligence, judgment.I confess I post this comment because none of the other comments I've seen on SEARCHING seems to me to realize how much Zaillian must have contributed to making this -- and I think it deserves this adjective  -- GREAT movie. (I further confess I didn't first watch the movie until some three years after its debut because of its title. I was damned if I wanted to spend two hours in the presence of someone as nasty-seeming as Fischer. But the title of course was Fred Waitzkin's, the author of the source book. Fred, you cost me a few years -- but Steven Zaillian has made up for it many times over.)

The movie does it by inserting newsreel footage of Bobby winning the World Chess Championship Tournament in Reykjavik Iceland back in 1972 against the Soviet Unions Boris Spassky. It then jumps back to when Bobby Fischer was a young boy, and man, in the 1950's and 1960's as his obsession with chess brought him the fame and glory that he sought. Yet at the same time denied him the life of a normal boy growing up in post WWII America that his night and day chess fixation cost him. Josh has lots of promise in becoming a future Bobby Fischer; he has a computer-like mind and a natural ability to foresee moves by his opponents, even before they even know that they'll make them. One thing that Josh doesn't have is that drive and determination, as well as killer-instinct, that Bobby Fisher had and as far as I know still does in playing to win and pulverizing his opponents into the ground by doing it. Josh likes all kinds of sports, besides chess, and his dad Fred Waitzkin, Joe Mantegna, is a sports writer who takes Josh along to the Yankee and New York Mets baseball games where the young boy really has as much of a good time watching the ball games as he has playing chess. Fred realizes what a whiz his young son Josh is in the game of chess and wants to have him study the finer points of the game by hiring former national chess champion Bruce Pandolfini, Ben Kingsley, to tutor him and Bruce right away realizes that Josh has the makings of another Bobby Fischer. What does bother Bruce about Josh is his playing with the local chess hustlers like Winnie, Laurence Fishburn, in Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village. Which, in Bruce's opinion, is far to fast and doesn't give young Josh time to develop his all around concentration and understanding of the game of chess. During the course of the movie Josh is driven relentlessly by Bruce in his attempt to mold him into another Bobby Fischer but Josh slowly starts to lose his interest in winning all the chess tournaments that he enters. The very fact of his invincibility makes Josh feel uneasy since it's always expected of him to win, like the sun is expected to rise in the morning, that there's no fun or excitement in it for him any more. Losing becomes more of a growing experience for Josh and even arouses his passions in making him feel more human. Josh is also too sensitive to beat down his opponents, like Bobby Fischer did. That later lost him the championship game against the likewise seven year-old chess phenomenon Jonathan Poe, Michael Nirenberg. After his defeat to Jonathan Josh is looked on as if he let down all those who believed in him and at the same time he starts to get his life back together as a young boy living a normal life and not carrying the weight of the entire world of chess on his shoulders. It's during this time that the real talent that Josh had in playing chess comes up to the surface, without him being driven relentlessly by Bruce. Those untapped talents leads him to go back to playing chess, first with his friend at the park Winnie, and then working his way back in winning a number of tournaments to his becoming a top chess champion competitor. All that finally earns Josh a re-match with Jonathan for the Junior Chess Championship of the US in Chicago at the conclusion of the film.Powerful movie and very intense for the young boys and girls in it in how they drive and push themselves to be the best at the game of chess and at the same time putting themselves in danger of sacrificing their one and only childhood to do it. Josh Waitzkin did reach the top back then when the movie Searching for Bobby Fischer was made in 1993 and is still there some ten years, and dozens of tournaments, later. He did it without losing both his childhood and his kind heart and sensitivity for his fellow man by doing it.

The ending was a bit hokey, as even I, with my low chess skills, would have recognized what was going to happen with just the two pawns left on the board but it doesn't affect my enjoyment of the movie much.

You just don't know it yet. &#x96; Joshua Waitzkin Bobby Fischer, regarded by some as the greatest chess player who ever lived, lost interest in the game several decades after becoming World Chess Champion. As Fischer grew as an artist &#x96; and chess is, in a sense, an art with its very own aesthetic &#x96; he began to outgrow the game entirely. He had discovered all there was to discover, mastering the board and finding no value within its black and white grid. What's more, Fischer began to develop a feeling of profound disgust for the game. He now held his opponents in contempt, seeing them all as inferior players who possessed neither the skill nor artistry to beat him. By the time Fischer began contemplating quitting the game forever, the heyday of chess, when grandmasters were superstars and games were heavily promoted international events, was already long gone. Younger players began copying the moves of the masters and chess became a form of memorised routines and pre-rehearsed tactics. Chess, as an art, was dead.For a while Fischer fought against the mechanization of chess (he even beat several chess super-computers), creating a variety of flamboyant and fresh tactics (even a series of new rules and objectives), but eventually he gave up. Having given himself to a cruel mistress whose 64 squares and 32 pieces had demanded complete and total loyalty, submission and sacrifice, he eventually decided to quit and move on to other things. Almost like a modern day Godard (Cinema is dead! It is useless!), he was an angry artist too big for a dead art-form. He had conquered it, achieved all he could, and found nothing of value in this victory. Over the following decades he would join religious cults, bounce from one confused romantic relationship to the next, always feeling miserable and unsatisfied. Seeking the sort of close human relationship that the cold confines of the chessboard could never offer, he reportedly died with the following words on his lips Nothing eases suffering like human touch. Searching for Bobby Fischer is about real-life chess prodigy Joshua Waitzkin. At first glance it seems like your regular sports movie &#x96; Waitzkin fights various opponents until he faces and defeats Jonathan Poe, the current National Scholastic Champion &#x96; but it pushes past this to become a surprisingly dark film which seeks to find the value (if any) of art, the meaning (or lack thereof) of professional mastery, and the sinister truths which emerge when one considers the libidinal motivations behind any and all human actions.The film begins with Waitzkin's father hiring a strict instructor, played by Ben Kingsley, to teach the young boy to be as aggressive and skillful as Bobby Fischer. Kingsley teaches the kid to hold his opponents in contempt, that there is no inherent value in victory and that one can only win by dominating another human being. Victory is simply the inferiority of your opponent combined with your own cult-like sacrifices made to the board. Mastery is intimately intertwined with the super-ego, victory tied with aggression, even sadism.Realizing that such dedication is turning his son into a robot, Waitzkin's mother turns to Laurence Fishburne, a chess hustler who plays on park benches. Fishburne teachers Waitzkin's to be spontaneous, to play fast and trust his instincts, to love the game and be gracious to those he plays.Eventually the film becomes a kind of battle between the id, ego and superego. Fishburne represents the pleasure principle, playing purely for pleasure in the moment, whilst Kingsley represents the reality principle, teaching Waitzkin's to put his life on hold and give himself over totally to the board so that he may reap the benefits of mastery 10 years down the line.The film's surface message is that one must achieve a sort of balance, symbolised by Waitzkin's merging of both Fishburne's and Kingsley's tactics during the film's climactic showdown. After this, Waitzkin's begins to take up other games (football, baseball, karate etc) and tries not to let chess suffocate his life. Chess thus becomes a kind of spiritual guide, like a medieval craftsman's way of life, where one does what one loves and humbly does it to perfection, and then moves on to another craft. Waitzkin &#x96; still a young man &#x96; would then go on to write self-help books, in which he espouses the realisation that victory and mastery ultimately means less than the process of acquiring knowledge within different fields. Conquer yourself and move on. There is no opponent but that within.But does this work? In real life, a decade after this film was made, Waitzkin would become a master in various other forms (karate, Tai Chi etc), before coming to the same kind of mental breakdown that Bobby Fischer did many years ago. He bounced from one craft to the next, mastering them all, but of course finding no inherent value in this mastery.Beyond its dark implications, the film works well as conventional entertainment. Chess is perhaps the most cinematic of games and so each chess scene here oozes a kind of palatable tension. Most of the film's best moments involve both audience members and chess players thrilled at having spotting obscure and daring combinations that, five to ten moves down the road, will inflict upon our opponents utter ruination. It's cool stuff.8.9/10 &#x96; Novice director Steven Zaillian is largely unaware of this film's true implications. Likewise, most viewers see the film as a conventional sports movie with a gooey Hallmark Channel aesthetic. But in a way, Zaillian's ignorance works in the film's favour. He's making your typical sports movie, looking for the orgasmic pay off of victory (and family reconciliation), whilst Waitzkin's father (who wrote the story) is telling a far darker tale. This tale has to be in the background, denied, ignored, or always indirectly addressed.

This last line of Searching for Bobby Fischer so eloquently defines for me the entire film. Searching has been accurately described as the best sports film about a non-sport. Of course, the sports aspect is provided by the discovery of Josh Waitzkin's talent for chess early in the film, the development of this gift and its release in the grit of Washington Square and the many tournaments Josh inhabits throughout the film.And yet...if there is a more self-less portrayal of a sports hero in a film, I have yet to see it. You see, unlike the title character, Josh is just an average, likable, sports-loving kid who happens to excel at rocket science...er, chess. He loves his Mom & Dad, his friends and the homeless guys he meets everyday in the park, oblivious to their abuse of controlled substances. And he wants to be loved in return, just like any other seven-year-old.So he strives for friendship, even among his chess-competing peers, and the love of the adults in his life. When you stop to think about it, this is really more about the ADULTS who learn to change and accept this decent boy (in his mother's words), rather than the boy who displays more maturity, sportsmanship and compassion than people more than three times his age! Of course, there's the obligatory final championship game, in which, to win, Josh must face his fears, personified in the evil chess boy, and Bobby Fischer wanna-be, Jonathan Poe. But by now, we realize this film is NOT all about winning and losing. And that brings me to the line I began this review with. As much as we rejoice with Josh in his victory, this actually pales in comparison with what he does in the final scene. Because Josh is now secure in is Dad's love and the respect and admiration of his chess teacher, he is free to show love and compassion to his best friend by cheering him up and saying something that is both poignant and hilarious, considering how close in age they are.Searching for Bobby Fischer is the film by which I actually measure all other sports films. Would that they all handled the subjects of sportsmanship and love in so eloquent a manner. What a great movie!

It follows him from the time his gift is discovered until he wins a national championship.  You should not avoid this movie if you know nothing about chess - it touches on many themes of broad interest, such as being a good parent, dealing with lost dreams, handling success, living with disappointment, being yourself when it conflicts with the desires of others, examining the value of a balanced life, and the nature of art.  Also, you need not worry about any half hour waits between chess moves - much of the chess played is speed chess and the serious games are telescoped so as to keep the attention of anyone who does not measure the quality of movie by the number of car crashes and explosions.Among the many delights in this film, perhaps the greatest is the astoundingly natural performance of Max Pomeranc as Josh.  It has to rank as one of the best performances by a child actor.  His performance is so sensitive, heart-renderingly touching, joyful, serious, and believable that it must in large part be the achievement of the director.  No kid could be that good naturally.    The rest of the cast is excellent as well.  Joe Mantegna plays Josh's sportswriter father Fred with a simple, but subtle, directness, and Joan Allen plays Josh's mother Bonnie with a gritty warmth and understanding.  She is very much plugged into Josh's emotional needs.  Fred and Bonnie are a typical couple sincerely coping with the challenges of raising a kid with an exceptional talent. Fred enlists the retired grand master Bruce Pandolfini (Ben Kingsley in another fine role) as Josh's teacher.  Bruce is a strict disciplinarian who sees in Josh a way to redeem the joy he lost when chess wizard Bobby Fischer decided to disappear after winning the world championship in 1972.  In addition to Bruce's desires for Josh, Fred is pushing Josh as hard and as fast as he will go.  Whereas these two strong-willed men have their own desires for Josh, in a pivotal scene with each man, the endearing and gentle Josh leads each of them to understand that, while they may have been searching for Bobby Fischer, who they most assuredly have found is Josh Waitzkin. Most of us are fascinated by genius, by talent beyond what we can imagine.  Using this fact, the screenplay heightens our interest by cleverly interweaving documentary footage of Bobby Fischer.  If you can remember back to the early 70's, you will recall that this prima-donna's prima-donna had such an effect on U.S. culture that you saw people playing chess in every public venue.  Hard to believe from the current vantage point.  On occasion the musical score gets out of control, being more appropriate for a big-screen western epic, but in many scenes sound is used as an effective punctuation mark.  The close-up sound of chess clocks being struck and pieces being moved provide an aural metaphor for the battles being waged on the chess boards.  Conrad Hall was justifiably nominated for an Oscar for best cinematography for this film.  Who would have imagined that you could generate such interest and excitement by filming chess pieces, chess boards, and chess halls.        There are many wonderful and moving scenes in this movie.  For example, Josh's first encounter with the game when he sees a motley group of hustlers engaged in speed chess matches in Washington Park. Josh is immediately transfixed.  If you have ever experienced anything like this in your life, this scene will give you chills.  Or the scene where Bruce first meets Josh in Josh's bedroom.  Bruce enters the room with the reverence a devout Catholic would have in meeting with the Pope.  Gingerly stepping around Josh's toys (the sound track calling attention with squeaking floors), Bruce absorbs the room's environment with the pleasure of an oenophile drinking an exceptional wine.  Such is the intoxicating attractive power of genius in some men's lives.Movies don't get much better than this.

It's curious, therefore, that writer/director Steve Zaillian, drawing from the book by the father of the real-life Josh Waitzkin, chooses to dress this movie in the same clothes of virtually every other &#145;sport' movie; that is, the tale of the driven loner who must overcome his inner doubts to achieve greatness.Josh Waitzkin, adeptly portrayed by debutante Max Pomeranc, (who, incidentally, is also a ranked player) is an ordinary child with an amazing gift for chess.

The relationship between Pandolfini and the boy, although respectful, grows increasingly adversarial as the serious stuff begins and Josh's nerve begins to waver.   Vinnie and Pandolfini represent opposite ends of the chess spectrum, each vying for Josh's loyaltySEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER is an entertaining, well-acted movie; its pace is leisurely but never flags, and it explores the relationships involved in the story intelligently, if a little shallowly at times (Josh's relationship with Vinnie &#150; potentially the most interesting of the story &#150; is especially under-written).   Only Zaillian's decision to make Josh's youthful chess-playing nemesis a somewhat sinister figure (something along the lines of the single-browed baby who occasionally pops up in the Simpsons) is badly misjudged. Zaillian seems conscious of the scarcity of a ready-made audience for this kind of tale, and strives to make chess something that it isn't &#150; exciting &#150; in an attempt to woo a larger audience.   Thus, he allocates equal time to the high-speed duels of the &#145;junkies and losers' at Washington Square as they capture pieces at breathtaking speed in their two-minute sprints as he does to the lengthier, and more sedate combat of the tournament player.   However, even during the tournament games, he chooses to have his participants slam their pieces on the board and smack the timer with exaggerated force in an attempt to inject excitement.  The film is shot through with darkness, hinting at the essentially introspective nature of the game and its participants; many of the scenes take place in darkened rooms populated by shadowy figures hunched over their pieces, and the chess-playing fraternity is portrayed as a rather mean-spirited lot, populated by embittered and eccentric men.   The enigmatic figure of Bobby Fischer serves as both an icon and a symbol of the consequence of the pressures genius bestows upon its owner.The concluding match, it has to be said, is very effectively staged, managing to wring every ounce of emotion from a potentially dry situation, although, regrettably, the story ultimately succumbs to genre convention once the game is over.

It is also a battle for the truth and balance of life. This film boasts an ensemble of great actors, where all the leads are magnificent, and magnificently understated. Laurence Fishburne as the inspirational street punk chess hustler, and Ben Kingsley as the emotionally shell-shocked ex-chess champion, deliver forcefully restrained performances, and Joe Mantegna delivers whirlwind of feelings as the father.

"},{"Title":"Knight to C-8, Checkmate!","Date":"1 July 2013","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama","Review":" Based on a true story the feature focuses upon a child chess prodigy, Josh Waitzkin. Oh, the lad does enjoy things like baseball, but as soon as he discovers his gift for chess, then it is a new beginning. We often see child masterminds in music and in art and in the sciences, including mathematics. For instance, didn't Mozart make his debut at age four? And what about Pascal, who wrote a treatise at age nine? Anyway, our seven year-old chess genius has a grasp of complicated moves that exceeds that of adults. Still, he is just a boy; he simply has not lived. In the film, we see clips of the great chess grandmaster, Bobby Fischer, who won the US Chess Championship at age 14. He could play (and win) many board games at once. He became official world champion in 1972 when he defeated Soviet champ Boris Spassky. After his victory, he appeared on a Bob Hope TV special. But after 1975 he became a recluse and practically disappeared from the planet. Fischer had controversial beliefs. For instance, he believed in a worldwide Jewish conspiracy, and favored the Palestinians over Israel. In any case, the film's title refers not to Bobby Fischer, but to a potential American successor, one who plays like him (like Josh). And hopefully not one who had lived such an abnormal life like Fischer.Josh Waitzkin, well-played by Max Pomeranc, a real chess player, was born with his gift, which he discovers at an early age. He enjoys going to Washington Park in NYC to play with the dregs and hustlers who hang out there. Note that one of the Russian players there once defeated Tal, who was world champ in 1960-61. The Washington Park folks play a fast game (blitz), use unorthodox moves, and intimate their opponents. Vinnie (Laurence Fishburne), a drug addict, is one of the hustlers in the park. He seems to like Josh. As he parents discover Josh's gift, they seem oblivious of what to do with it. For instance, is winning at chess the only thing in life? Eventually, Josh's sports-writer father Fred (Joe Mantegna, in a luminous performance), hires Bruce Pandolfini (Ben Kingsley) a brilliant chess-master and former national champion, to coach his son. Bruce's style, in contrast to Vinnie's, is to use the planned approach. But Bruce seems to be almost as difficult to deal with as Fischer. He says that Josh's personality is represented by the KING chess piece, and reminds Josh that Bobby Fischer held the world in contempt. Bruce wants to keep the boy away from Washington Park, which is a hindrance to his understanding of the finer points of chess even though Josh loves the place. When Bruce later tries to teach Josh the cutthroat style of chess, Josh's mother (Bonnie = Joan Allen), becomes chagrined and states, He's decent! (Translation = He does not hate his opponents.) When a patronizing teacher (Laura Linney) tries to belittle Josh's achievement &#x96; his string of victories &#x96; Fred indignantly proclaims, He's better at this than I've ever been at anything in my life. He's better at this than you'll ever be at anything. My son has a gift. He has a gift, and when you acknowledge that, then maybe we will have something to talk about.There is a point where one may ask what happens when the need to win consumes all of the fun. In the course of the movie, we learn much about tournament chess, as Josh works his way to the top. We see what happens when he begins to lose interest and sustains a series of reverses before he regains his position. In the end it comes down to the two best players &#x96; Josh and Jonathan Poe &#x96; for the junior national championship. Who will win? The movie is based upon Fred Waitzkin's autobiographical book. Our feature does not focus on any one game or on individual piece moves, so that one does not need to know how to play chess to enjoy the film. Ben Kingsley, as usual, is great in his portrayal of Bruce Pandolfini, a real New York personality who teaches chess, writes columns, and has authored many books. He actually coached young Waitzkin for quite a long time. Apparently the real Pandolfini is milder and has a more easygoing style, unlike the movie's portrayal. But that's Hollywood. An error is the film was a reference to former world champion Casablanca; that grandmaster's real name was Jose Raul Capablanca (In 1921 Capablanca defeated Emanuel Lasker, who had held the world championship since 1894, when he bested Wilhelm Steinitz). Despite minor issues, the movie exudes both realism and fascination.Postscript Josh Waitzkin became an International Master at age 16. He developed into the highest rated American chess player under age 18, and was national chess champion eight times. Waitzkin authored two books. He moved on into the martial arts field, and won championships. The youngest grandmaster in American history is now Fabiano Luigi Caruana, who was not quite 15 when he won in 2007.

Bobby Fischer was arguably the greatest chess player of all time. As a boy, he faced and defeated the greatest players of his time. In 1972, after a prelude of countless controversies, he won the world chess championship away from the Russians for the first time in years. Then he essentially disappeared and went off the deep end-- into a underworld of rented rooms, phantom sightings, and paranoid outbursts. Searching for Bobby Fischer-a film of remarkable sensitivity and insight, tells a story based on fact, about a new Bobby Fischer - a young boy named Josh Waitzkin (Max Pomeranc), who was born with a gift for chess--which he nurtured in the rough-and- tumble world of of chess hustlers in New York's Washington Square Park. His parents acknowledge his gift, but are concerned about how he can develop it without stunting the other areas of his life. After realizing what his son is capable of, Fred seeks out a chess player--a once highly regarded grand master named Bruce Pandolfini (Ben Kingsley), and hires him to tutor Josh. Bruce tries to teach his pupil a regimented, cerebral approach to the game, while Josh's mentor from the park, Vinnie (Laurence Fishburne) favors a fast paced and aggressive style used by hustlers to intimidate their opponents. Josh proves so adept at the game that Fred enters his son in a tournament. Bruce advises against this, believing that winning and losing has nothing to do with chess. Caught up in his son's gift and the thrill of competition, Fred pushes Josh to excel. Josh's weakness as a sportsman is his kindness, which Bonnie fears Fred will beat out of him in his efforts to make his son a winner. When he encounters another prodigy (Michael Nirenberg), who dispatches his opponents with cold-blooded efficiency. Josh has to decide for himself how important winning and losing is. The movie succeeds with the heart-warming, honest acting of the film's protagonist Max Pomeranc. Steven Zaillian, the director, made a conscious choice when he cast the film to find kids who actually could play chess. He wanted chess players first and foremost- - and who also could handle the demands of the script. His face is expressive, open - and yet strangely inscrutable when he plays chess. The criteria Zaillian demands of his protagonist ultimately defines whether this film works or not- -and Max delivers a truly natural performance. The audiences' enjoyment of this film pivots on his character-- and Pomeranc is wonderful. Zaillian's superb script attracted a fantasitc cast that includes Joe Mantegna, Joan Allen, Ben Kingsley, and Laurence Fishburne. Supported in minor roes by David Paymer, William H. Macy, Tony Shalhoub, Dan Hedaya, Laura Linney, and Austin Pendleton. Of all those Renowned cinematographer Conrad Hall referred to the film in what he called magical naturalism - conveying a child's sense of imagination - while James Horner's music reflects that spirit with equal mastery. Searching for Bobby Fischer is an intensely fascinating movie capable of involving those who are not familiar about chess, as well as those who love it. Steven Zaillian effectively integrates the actual story and footage of Bobby Fischer throughout the film--running parallel to Josh's story, only enhancing the fascinating storyline. The focus of the film is less on the actual game than it is on the people, emotions, and pressures surrounding Josh. It is a tale of the human spirit and triumph. By the end of Searching for Bobby Fischer, we have gained insight about the intensity and competitiveness nature of chess tournaments, and a great deal about human nature. The film's implications are many. Think of it as a very smart sports film that substitutes quiet intensity for physical action. There's no denying Searching For Bobby Fischer is one film in which every major element - writing, directing, casting, photography, music - is perfectly in tune, exploring the nature of competition with humor, intelligence, and depth.

Frankly, the plot is the typical American sports movie with the good hearted champion that has both talent and decency and that works hard for his art. I guess it would have been worse if it wasn't based on the book written by Josh Waitzkin's father.Josh Waitzkin has a fascinating story that I recommend you read on. He was the highest rated chess player in the US since he was 8 years old, then his father wrote the book that this movie is based on, then all the sudden celebrity messed with his chess game. Instead of clinging to chess, Josh decides to stop playing, and takes up Ju-Jitsu. He does great at it as well. His book, The Art of Learning, describes the process. Josh Waitzkin is also the guy from the Waitzkin Academy tutorial in the ChessMaster XI chess game.But back to the film. At the time, Josh was the next Bobby Fischer, only nicer. Everybody loved a true American hero, especially in a game that was dominated by Russians. The Art of Learning was not out yet, so the people that made the movie saw no problem in portraying the boy as a chess prodigy that did not lose to anyone unless he chose to. In reality, the wonder of Josh Waitzkin is that he really was brilliant and even as a kid he realised that losing is the true teacher. Losing in a finals of a championship defined his life, as he saw the true value of humility and confidence. Having all that information in the background had me see the movie with completely different eyes and I rather liked it. I wish it was more technical, but then no one would watch it except a few Russians, so...Funny trivia three chess players depicted in the movie were the real people Kamran Shirazi, Joel Benjamin and Roman DzinDziChashvili, while a girl identified as 82nd girl, which means one of Josh's opponents in the game who ranked the 82nd, is Katya Waitzkin, Josh's real life sister.Bottom line it has some valuable lessons in there, but hidden in the usual Hollywood bull. It is nice to watch and has a lot more meaning to chess players than people not playing. I liked it.

For many people I suspect the game conjures up images of older men sitting and thinking for hours while barely speaking, or older images of Soviet grandmasters playing each other for some championship or another.Considering this, I feel the movie does an outstanding job of generating excitement for the game. The capturing scenes in both the park games and the championship games convey real excitement, and action.In addition, the movie does just a stellar job of replicating the chess atmosphere the combative and legalistic style of some players, the sheer depth of obsessive knowledge some club players have about the game, and the anger of some parents at tournaments (this last, of course, is also associated with other youth sports). Having played in clubs and tournaments, both as a child and as an adult, I can attest that that is exactly how it is. Grandmaster Pal Benko deserves a lot of credit for his role in advising the production staff, for it would be virtually impossible for someone unfamiliar with the chess club atmosphere to know these details.The best aspect of the movie is the set of characterizations Max Pomeranc is simply awesome as the child chess prodigy. The mom (Joan Allen), the dad (Joe Mantegna), the schoolteacher (Laura Linney), the chess teacher (Ben Kingsley), the child opponent and his obsessive teacher (Michael Nirenberg and Robert Stephens) all did an exceptional job portraying highly specialized characters, or at least ordinary characters faced with rather special situations.As a chess player, I paused this movie several times to try to replicate the final dozen moves or so of the final game.

Look at all the sports dramas that deal with football, baseball and combat. But those kinds of sports movies are very popular for the typical blue-collar to watch just for fun. Who enjoys watching chess? I love to play chess, but watching it on TV? No thank-you! Searching For Bobby Fischer was a risk and it succeeded in more ways than one.Searching For Bobby Fischer is based on the book by sports journalist, Fred Waitzkin about his son Josh. Josh was just a normal 7-year-old who enjoyed playing with toys and dreamed of being a baseball player. After briefly watching several chess games in a New York park, he decides to play himself. His parents (Mantegna, Allen) see him as a prodigy. They hire a strict teacher (Kingsley) to help Josh hone his craft and tries to guide him to be the next Bobby Fischer. That is what the movie should have been called The Next Bobby Fischer. Searching For Bobby Fischer sounds like the real chess master is involved as a character. This is false advertising if you ask me. Josh is enjoying chess, but the pressure from his dad and teacher become too much for him to bear. Fred mentions that Josh is better at chess than he has ever been at anything. After Josh sees another prodigy in the park who might be better than him, Josh devotes all his time to chess in hopes of making his father proud.In order for a movie with a boring concept to succeed, everything that goes into the film has to be held at high calibre. SFBF does just that. Likewise, the game sequences are actually pretty cool to watch. Searching For Bobby Fischer probably inspired many children to try the game of chess. But I guarantee more than half couldn't fully understand the rules of the game.Ultimately what makes Searching For Bobby Fischer work so well the way it does is the way it shows parents impacting their children. After seeing how talented his young son is, Fred Waitzkin places tremendous pressure on him to be the best chess player in the world. Josh is an innocent kid who just wants to have fun, but also make his father proud of him. That's all any kid wants. Seeing his rival adds more pressure, as Josh thinks losing to another prodigy would lose his father's love.

"},{"Title":"Drama about chess, life and staying true to oneself","Date":"25 June 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Drama","Review":" Despite the title, Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993) isn't about the extraordinary chess champion, Bobby Fischer, but rather true-life chess prodigy Josh Waitzkin (played convincingly by Max Pomeranc). The story chronicles his rise to prominence as a 7-8 year-old in the world of chess competition. The eccentric and reclusive Fischer permeates the proceedings, however, as he's constantly referred to and there's even footage of him being interviewed or beating a dozen experts simultaneously, etc. Joe Mantegna and Joan Allen play Josh's father & mother while Ben Kingsley and Laurence Fishburne play his formal and informal teachers respectively.I don't think you need to know about chess to enjoy this film, but it wouldn't hurt. It's primarily a drama and, secondarily, a sports film. Being about chess, it lacks the action of conventional sports films, but it's a sports film nevertheless with its inherent formula. Regardless, I was surprised at how suspenseful they made the final match, which isn't easy to do since chess doesn't seemingly lend itself to cinema.This is a film that'll likely improve on repeat viewings because there are a few interesting subtexts. For instance, Josh's formal instructor and his dad keep trying to mold him into the likeness of Fischer and his misanthropic mindset, but Josh's mother and informal instructor encourage him to be who he is and play naturally. The former two foster rigid discipline and contemptible aggressiveness while the latter two encourage spontaneity and the joy of the game. Perhaps a balance between both is best.Years ago I informally studied chess for a couple of years, reading books and manually performing all the moves, buying & playing computer sets, etc. but I'd only be considered average at best compared to the child players in the film. The reason I bring this up is because, as much as I knew on the topic at the time, I realized I merely touched the surface and that there were whole new realms to explore, learn and master. This is the way it is with any great sport/art/topic/occupation. To truly grasp any one of them and master it to any degree requires serious determination and great sacrifice. You can't be a jack of all trades and expect to be extraordinary in one.The movie also seems to be saying that you shouldn't sacrifice everything else to be a chess master and lose the joy of playing, the joy of living. After all, what good is that? While this is true, it only goes so far and Waitzkin's life since the movie proves it He wanted to do other things than be a chess champion, which is fine, but to do so he had to drop out of chess competition altogether, which he did in 1999. By contrast, Garry Kasparov is considered the most consistent chess champion, holding the record for the longest time as the No. 1 rated player in the world from 1986 to 2005 (two freakin' decades), precisely because of his skill, determination and sacrifices.The movie inspires you to look up the incredible Fischer who reigned supreme in the 60s through early 70s and then dropped off the face of the earth. In 1981 he stayed with grandmaster Peter Biyiasas for four months where he beat Biyiasas seventeen times in speed chess. Biyiasas later testified in a Sports Illustrated interview He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. Bobby honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that. Bobby Fischer never viewed the film, but rightly complained that it was improper to use his name and footage of him without his permission. Fischer never received any compensation from the movie and said he was swindled.Look for the beautiful Laura Linney in a bit part.The film runs 109 minutes and was shot in New York City, including Washington Square (where numerous scenes take place), and Toronto.GRADE B+ "},{"Title":"Alright Story, Great Performances","Date":"17 April 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Drama","Review":" A prepubescent chess prodigy refuses to harden himself in order to become a champion like the famous but unlikable Bobby Fischer.While chess has never been my game, it is something I can probably identify with a bit better than basketball (see Hoop Dreams), so this fictionalized story of a real-life prodigy is a story I can get behind. Of course, it is not very cinematic to just show two hours of people playing chess. And that leads the film's flaw the narrative is good, but not incredibly engaging. Also, if you just guessed the whole story, you probably guessed right.But the performances make up for any shortcomings. Some really fine actors get to be supporting cast to this little guy.

"},{"Title":"Winning's Not The Only Thing","Date":"16 January 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Drama","Review":" You've got to go to the edge of defeat, one player tells another in the second half of Searching For Bobby Fischer. That seemed to be the guiding strategy behind the movie as well.Writer-director Steven Zaillian takes an unfilmable subject (chess), bases it on a book few read, names it after a guy nobody had seen in 20 years, and puts it all in the lap of an eight-year-old actor who never starred in a film before and would star in only one after. Searching For Bobby Fischer does all it can to stack the board against itself, yet succeeds quite well despite, and indeed, because of all that.Joshua Waitzkin (Max Pomeranc) is celebrating his seventh birthday in Washington Square Park when he catches sight of some rough-looking characters moving what look like his Lego figures on tables of black-and-white squares. Chess is a game few master, yet Josh learns it just from watching them. Soon he is amazing parents and wizened grandmasters alike with his skill at the game, but is Josh really a prodigy on the scale of Bobby Fischer, the New York youngster who went on to win the world championship - then disappear?Searching For Bobby Fischer is a fairly formulaic film in many ways. It presents us with stock situations like an adorable boy who only wants to be good; a father (Joe Mantegna) who is too concerned with winning; a mother (Joan Allen) afraid her son is being turned into a machine; and a streetwise black man (Laurence Fishburne) who sees things in the child before anyone else. There's even a villain who appears shrouded in darkness, and who glares at Josh so menacingly its easy to forget this dark figure isn't quite four feet tall.But the formula really works in this one, in part because it serves such a strange cause (how many other chess movies can you think of?) and mostly because of Pomeranc's unaffected work in the lead role. Pomeranc seems preternaturally aware of his fragility on camera and plays to it in ways that reflect not precociousness but depth. You just feel for the guy, exult with his triumphs and feel his disappointments so much you resent Mantegna when his character rides Josh about doing better.Pomeranc also does great ensemble work with the other characters, especially Ben Kingsley as Josh's instructor Bruce, a fellow who seems to have been somebody's idea of Josh a generation ago only for it to collapse on him. Bruce doesn't want Josh to show mercy, you sense because he blames his own softness for his post-child ruination.Bobby Fischer held the world in contempt, he tells Josh.I'm not him, Josh replies. That's the whole movie right there.Searching For Bobby Fischer feels incomplete in parts. Maybe it's just zen-like in its comfort with koan-like plot holes. We never get a real chance to see Josh learning much with Vinnie, the Fishburne character, in a way that would better explain their later closeness. Mantagna's transformation into hard-driving parent (he has a funny but nasty scene with a teacher played by Laura Linney, one of many future talents on display here) isn't laid out convincingly. But thanks both to Zaillian's affecting script and superlative camera work by the incomparable Conrad Hall working close to his zenith, you sense many things lying just beneath the surface of your view, there to be pondered when the rush of the film dissipates.And what a rush! Josh learns that winning isn't everything, but he also comes to care enough to give it his best shot in a climax both thrilling and heartwarming, even if it plays a bit to conventions. Searching For Bobby Fischer suggests something redemptive and perhaps even romantic in a game it dares to compare to art. In the process, it winds up presenting us with art both in theory and in practice.

As a teacher, what is the correct way to teach your pupils? There is no certain answer. But the film has the ability of making you think while delivering an exciting plot.Searching for Bobby Fischer is truly an inspiration. It is a reflection for parents to rethink how they should raise their kids, and how to give them the right message to pursue their interests. The film also shows there is no single correct way of teaching. A child should learn from all aspects, from different people and via different methods. Maybe it's better not to be the best. Then you can lose and it's OK. Josh gives us a peek of the pressure of all the constant winners - it is hard for an all-time winner to lose, and sometimes you would rather be not the best so you can actually lose without feeling too bad. The only advisable solution is probably to give yourself less pressure when it comes to competitions by loving the game rather than forcing yourself to win. After all, it is just a game in which you are supposed to seek interest, and you should be enjoying the moment.This is highly recommended for all ages. Beautifully written is the script. There is nothing to criticize on the acting. The background music throughout the movie is highly enjoyable and appropriate. The simplicity of the movie is also great. For kids, this is a great adventure about a unknown chess prodigy becoming a champion. For grown-ups, this is also a story that gives something to learn and something to think about. Searching for Bobby Fischer is the kind of movie that can stand the test of time. Although it was made almost 20 years ago, I don't feel a bit of antiquatedness at all.

The large majority of them never make it past adolescence. In many cases, some of them didn't get beyond the point of doing something quite well at a very early age and were dismissed when the age factor no longer applied. This said, the parents pushed so many of them mercilessly - and rather unashamedly. The kids wanted to please their parents and the parents wanted to please themselves. It's as simple and as tragic as that and it goes on everywhere, with sports near the top, for example.The film then came as no particular surprise. It could be a valuable wake-up call to overly ambitious parents who haven't noticed who their kids ARE rather than what they can do. In this respect the film was spot on and quite frank and sincere. It went on for too long. There were too many re-wordings throughout which made the effort seem pedantic at times. The actors, too often shown in semi-obscurity, did their parts beautifully and I would agree with another reviewer who found the wife's contribution essential and beautifully underplayed.The game of chess doesn't have much attraction for those who don't know the game and the director and writer kept this firmly in mind by speeding up the rounds and focusing on the facial expressions. The film could definitely be tightened up and pared down a bit.Curtis Stotlar "}{"Title":"Not Just for Chess Geeks","Date":"1 April 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Drama","Review":" I first saw this movie when it first came out, and I was in my mid-twenties and just getting started in the world. I saw it then as a movie about chess, and what young chess prodigies go through in order to reach the top levels.I saw it again last night, eighteen years later. The movie is the same, but I am different. I am about the age of Josh Waitzkin's father, and I have a daughter who is the same age as Josh. And although my daughter is not a prodigy of chess or anything else, I can see a lot of her in Josh, and a lot of me in his father.This is actually not a film about chess; it is a film about raising children. We live in the Dallas suburbs, where there are a lot of families and a lot of activities for children. I see parents take their children to soccer games, gymnastics camps and acting classes, and I see the obsession in their eyes. They want to expose their kids to many different pursuits, but once they see a talent forming, they focus on only that pursuit, to the exclusion of all others. They sink their money, their time, and all of their child's energy into developing that talent, at the expense of all other interests.Maybe it is pressure to earn a scholarship. Maybe it is the availability of year-round seasons and elite leagues. Maybe it is the unbelievable salaries that top athletes are earning. But I think that the problem that this movie points out -- that pushing kids to be the best at something at any cost -- has gotten worse instead of better.This movie could just as easily been about gymnastics or golf or music as it is about chess. The issues raised are the same. I just hope that more parents can see this film, and recognize that if our goal is raise happy, balanced people, pushing our kids to become elite performers is not the way to get there.

I think it might have been a preview from another movie that just made me recognize the title at my local video rental store back then, either way I brought it home and watched it.Needless to say at this point it was a delightful surprise. I was afraid at first that the movie was gonna take on too much of a documentary approach to the life of Bobby Fischer but it of course turns out that it has nothing to do with him, sort of. Fischer is simply used as a reference to compare the young boy Josh to. This is simply to show what the consequences might be by emerging yourself completely into the chess world.The story is about a boy with a talent for chess who plays because it's fun and his dad who sees this talent as a possible way of life for his boy.This makes for very touching scenes in the movie, great characters that you get to dive into and without overdoing it get a great look into what motivates each character, and that's basically what the movie is about, motivation.I won't write any spoilers for this movie as you deserve to see it for yourself, sufficed to say that another twist on this movie are scenes where the chess pieces get moved around like they were fighting in a kung-fu movie.For laughs, tear, goosebumps and a great fascinating semi-true story you must not miss this film.

The hallmark of a great screenplay is that it rarely (if  ever) tells you what it is showing you. Schindler's List had a few places  where it told you as well as showed you, but these seem to have been  directorial decisions (leave it to Spielberg to make that sort of thing  work!). However, this movie never told you what it showed you. It simply showed you.Also, how many other screenwriters could have made chess an edge-of-your -seat *sport*!

Decades later, I decided to give it another try because a friend said it was his favorite movie.I still don't like it. Part of the reason is I really can't take kid actors. There is something wrong with parents who put their kids through that. Thankfully the kid in this film was smart and got out of acting.But there's another reason I don't like this movie. It's not very good. It's slow and tedious and rather pretentious and predictable. It's very Hollywood, using formulaic story-telling and direction. In a sense it really insults your intelligence.The plotJosh Waitzkin is just a typical American boy interested in baseball when one day he challenges his father at chess and wins. Showing unusual precocity at the outdoor matches at Washington Square in New York City, he quickly makes friends with a hustler named Vinnie who teaches him speed chess. Josh's parents hire a renowned chess coach, Bruce, who teaches Josh the usefulness of measured planning. Along the way Josh becomes tired of Bruce's system and chess in general and purposely throws a match, leaving the prospects of winning a national championship in serious jeopardy.

Great story, and great acting by Max Pomeranc.So naturally, I wanted to learn more about Josh Waitzkin, and much to my disappointment I found that the ending was a complete lie. Yes, Josh did play for the US championship. But in reality Josh didn't win. When Josh was 9 years old, he had a draw against a 7-year old named Jeff Sarwer. And an analysis of the game shows that Jeff was clearly winning, but a mistake cost him, ending the game in a draw.Jeff Sarwer is an interesting story. In real life, Pandolfini said that he had never met anyone else with such a raw talent for the game. But unlike Josh who grew up in a comfortable surroundings, Jeff really did play speed chess with the drug addicts. His father was considered abusive, and Jeff and his equally talented sister Julia were taken away from his father by protective services. But the kids ran away from a foster home, back to their father, and Jeff didn't play chess again for almost 20 years. And when he did, he beat a number of grandmasters despite having no apparent practice.So far we know that the ending was a lie (thanks to the Internet making these games from 1985 available), and that Jeff played with the drug addicts. So what is really true?My unfortunate conclusion is that Josh's dad saw that while his child was talented, he was nowhere close to Jeff Sarwer (by the way, Josh never made GrandMaster). But with Sarwer out of the way, why not make his son look good, and make Jeff look bad. What a travesty! "},{"Title":"Community Chess","Date":"13 April 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Drama","Review":"  Spoilers herein.The best films of course are those where the level of work from every artist is high and it all comes together in a visual symphony. Second best are the onedimensional ones where the skill of a single artist is played out. I find these particularly interesting to watch because you can often see the wires and scaffolding of that person's art.When that person is an actor, you get a film about acting (`Wag the Dog'), when a set designer, you get `Titus' (or `Casper'). Usually, when the person in charge is a writer, you get a story about writing or a similar art. This is great writing, in the sense of effective screenwriting. And so it is here, the focus for us is on creative vision. The problem is that there are two stories here and the lesser one detracts from the more powerful, the one we are meant to see.The lesser story is about a father struggling with parenting a prodigy, with a backstory of Pandolfini's monkey. These are Hallmark parents and a simple drama. While slick, it is trivial. Unfortunately, this is the film that Horner scores, Hall photographs, and which most people will see. In this film, chess is a bunch of jumpcuts, and clock slaps and is there merely as a learning tool.Early on, Pandolfini gives a problem. The kid says he can't visualize without moving the pieces, so the pieces are swept away. Similarly. it is easier to see what is going on in this film without the distraction of actually being lead by the actors. There's a deeper film here, if you care to sweep away the pieces. Fortunately for us, there is a homeopathic power to this second film -- the less it is shown, the more powerful it is. But it is there, haunting, just as Fisher himself haunts.Chess is the most cinematic of intellectual constructs it is literally visual logic, evolved to be deliberately beyond the complexity a mind can handle. A `player' works with imperfect situational visions, fragments of consciousness, roles not at all unlike certain styles of acting. You _project_. One can make a film about genius in chess far more readily than in math or music, because the nature of the game is cinematic. It literally descends from the same tree of imagination of storytelling, and is the first and still richest interactive narrative. Alas, though we have a world-class cinematographer here, he is not allowed to focus on the game itself. No matter, imagination is stronger.So far as the styles of acting, it is a matter of genius to cast Fishburn against Kingsley, because their approaches to acting mirror the approaches to chess their characters play. Kingsley is disciplined, controlled, focused; Fishburn intuitive, personal, unpredictable.Winning a chess game is the rudest metric of excellence, and befits, well, a baseball-playing oaf of a father. So it is a letdown that we have the formulaic end of a victory -- it is as if the game were treated like, well, pinochle. But that's the movie that you are supposed to ignore.

This time around had new meaning as I have a child very gifted with piano. I've had similar challenges to Josh Waitzkin's parents in trying to decide how much to push your children - and for what purposes. Most parents probably feel that pull, even without geniuses - finding balance in what kids CAN do, what they SHOULD do, and what they WANT to do. We want our children to be happy, but we also know that part of being happy is doing something they are good at and helping them find meaning.I'm also a fan of chess and so really enjoy the glimpses into the chess world this movie portrays. The brilliance of those who stand even above the best minds in their field is the stuff of legends. Bobby Fischer, Garry Kasparov, Anatoly Karpov, Emmanuel Lasker... every bit leaders in their elite worlds as the likes of say Michael Jordan, Mike Tyson, Tiger Woods. Always interesting to me.Great performances all around, from the young (and skinny) Laurence Fishburne to the always stately Ben Kingsley. From the interested and caring parents to the young Josh Waitzskin... even the enemy chess player are all well cast and enjoyable throughout the movie.A modern classic in my opinion, and great for the whole family (probably at least 7 or 8 years old is a good lower limit). I appreciate the lessons it teaches, the story of Josh and the truths we discover.

He was the most renowned and most skilled chess master who ever lived. His level of expertise at the game of chess could be matched by no one but himself. He was a legend to that world, but only revered because of his ability at chess. Apart from that he was a detached and solitary individual who obviously had some sort of mental deficiency that kept him from connecting with the real world. Thus his world was all chess. Searching for Bobby Fischer is the story of Josh Waitzkin, another chess master who was discovered long after Bobby Fischer. Josh unexpectedly discovers that he has a unique gift in playing chess and so the pressure from all different people sets in for him to become the best. The title of the film is Searching for Bobby Fischer, but in the context of the film the title literally means searching for the next Bobby Fischer. These pressures and goals Josh must face send us through an interesting, yet very subdued story.Searching for Bobby Fischer is very slow, but appropriately slow. Not a ton actually happens in the film as it is much more character driven. There are a lot of different characters in the film that each drive different plot lines. The film takes a while to get going because of the different characters that have be introduced, and are introduced very slowly and drawn out. Because of this early character development, there's a lot of build up necessary before the first actual conflicts of the film arise. It is almost an hour into the film before we get to see these conflicts start to take shape and affect the storyline. You have to stick with this film to get the full effect of it, which is worth it in the end. I can also commend the story for being very focused but also broad. The stories obviously centers around chess, but as it goes along it becomes more about Josh's relationships with the various people in his life, more so than anything else. The main theme of the film eventually molds into character relationships, as each character seems to have a clear cut relation with the others in order to fully flesh them all out and make them interesting.The storyline works in such a way that it is easy for it to elicit emotional responses out of its audience, so because of this I felt a little less drawn in. I didn't feel much emotion throughout the film and most of the time I just had to take it for what it was. Speaking from a personal standpoint, it isn't the most fascinating kind of story for me, but it doesn't mean it wasn't a well made film. It is very high quality with all the necessary aspects to make it a notable film. The direction is very subdued and avoids anything flashy or grand, but it keeps the flow of the film nice and smooth. The dialouge also keeps with the silky smooth theme of the film, and it is delivered by some very fine actors.All the actors do a very nice job in their respective roles. The main character, Josh Waitzkin, is only seven years old and for a child actor does a decent job. He was very sophisticated for his age and didn't always feel like a kid, but maybe that was the intention of the film. He probably was a fairly detached boy, just like Bobby Fischer, and so he didn't seem like what we think of when we think seven year old boy. And yet the film also spent a lot of time focusing on Josh's balance between chess and growing up like a normal kid, so his attitude wasn't always fitting. Plus he seems like he is on depressants for the entire film. The rest of the cast is A-list and does a great job. Joe Mantegna as Josh's father does a great job as a character trying to balance out his life much in the same way Josh is balancing his. His father must balance his want for his son to be a great chess player, but he also wants his son to live a normal childhood without all of the extreme pressures of chess. Ben Kingsley and Laurence Fishburne both play mentors to Josh, but with very different personalities. Kingsley is an old retired chess master who is very by the book and rigid in his teaching. Fishburne is much more free and sees the game of chess as a much more surreal and introspective experience. The contrast between these two characters is very interesting to watch unfold.Searching for Bobby Fischer is a good film, not a great film, just a good film. It has all the necessary components that make good films. The direction is smart, the dialouge is crisp, and the acting is fantastic. From a personal standpoint this wasn't the most gripping or emotionally moving film for me, but for others I can definitely see how it would be. This film can be enjoyed a lot more than I enjoyed it because it is a good film and there are a lot of good things going for it. But as far as I'm concerned, it was one of those films that I watch, enjoy enough to feel like it was worth my two hours, but then I never watch it again.

In how many films does this happen? Most everyone seems to like this movie.Well, it's a movie with the main ingredients of an early 1990's film and it definitely has that feeling of the early 90's. It is okay but not great. Some sequences are not all that great and it also doesn't help that some of them are dreadfully slow. The title of this movie may be confusing. Without knowing what is it about, you might think it's about searching Bobby Fischer or that it's based on his life. But it's neither one thing neither another. It is about prodigy chess player Joshua Waitzkin and the title's purpose is only to be a metaphor about his quest to adopt Fischer's ideal and his determination of winning no matter what.Josh is portrayed by Max Pomeranc. He was selected for this role partly because he already knew how to play chess. The other actors didn't, although Joe Mantegna did learn.This is the first of only 2 movies which Max Pomeranc stars in. Yes, his career was short, way too short. After this he was in 'Fluke' (1995). After that, he didn't star in any more movies. He was a very handsome kid and a very gifted actor. His innocent and tender look, his expressive face and eyes, his natural-born talent... he was a wonderful little actor. He is the star of this motion-picture written and directed by Steven Zaillian.It's great that they made a movie about chess, even though it obviously isn't all about chess. Josh, the main character, is 7 years old and from the very start it is evident that he has a gift for chess. They even want to take advantage of that by hiring an instructor who wants him to become the next Bobby Fischer. But Josh isn't like that. He may be as talented as Bobby Fischer, but he's not him and does not want to possess his character. Josh is a gentle champion.

Even though they tried to make the movie more for all viewers, I feel that was not accomplished.

If you were to watch a Scrabble movie, you'd see similar game freaks, but with probably fewer comedic bits than this movie managed to squeeze in and without the lesson that a game doesn't have to be your whole life.Since the movie was targeted for chess players, I think they could have at least focused on one or two actual chess positions in the movie, and then could've sold T-shirts with Searching for Bobby Fischer and that position on a t-shirt.

You could just go a block from the Washington sq. to a chess café and find someone who'd have time to help not to make this movie an embarrassment.

Do his parents have a responsibility to nurture it, with or without the child's will, or should they just leave him alone?  In this case the genius is in chess; it could have easily been about math or music, and been as good a movie.  The point of the movie isn't about chess itself, but about promise and potential at an early age. The direction and script, however, smother the movie in grave solemnity; if you watch The Greatest Story Ever Told, about Christ's life, the characters do not speak with the grave tones and hushed solemness that they do when they speak of the boy's gift for chess.  The mother is especially annoying; every word she utters about her son, about anything, in fact, is delivered with a stone-faced stolidness and a Clint Eastwood whisper that would put even Dirty Harry to shame.  One wonders how she let her hair down long enough to conceive their child in the first place.  The father is equally awed by his kid's genius at moving chess pieces, and puts up with an off-putting character played by Ben Kingsley to tutor his kid.  The movie does make its points about genius versus normal happiness, and where the line is between encouraging and pushing your kid, but it is hard to forget that we are talking about a game here.  No lives will be saved or lost if he doesn't show up for a tournament.  He won't even learn any useful life skills (or social skills, for that matter) by playing better chess.  By the end of the film, I felt like I had learned more about Western attitudes and values than anything else; we are a country that can afford to obsess about whether our kid has the best chess tutor, rather than worrying about where our next meal is coming from (like the majority of the world does.)  Our values are certainly in order.  If the film had taken a look at our value system which puts the importance chess over, say, medicine or starvation, I think it would have had more to say.  (Does anyone really care where Bobby Fischer is, by the way?  Why?)Four out of ten stars.  It would have been six without the ten layers of melodrama.
