It deals with an illiterate called Giorgi (Danny Kaye, able to tongue twist faster than anyone else) along with his boss (Walter Slezak) , both of whom are wandering and acting as medicine men into a provincial town wherein panic . Then Giorgi's detained for vagrancy charge but he's misidentified as a feared Inspector General who comes to check up on them and whom the corrupter town officers (the Mayor  Gene Lockhart married to Elsa Lanchaster and another officer played by Alan Hale) think is secretly moving in disguise . Later on , they make various bungled tryings to murder him . Meanwhile , Giorgi falls in love with a beautiful maid (Barbara Bates) who is serving to the Mayor. The film is a Danny Kaye recital , he sings , dances , stooges , makes acrobatics , tongue twister and puts faces and grimaces . It's a pretty amusing farce suggested by a play by the Russian writer Gogol with the master comedy actor and it displays much choreography and musical numbers . Sylvia Fine , Kaye's wife , is the lyricist , composer , besides associate producer and dialogs writer , and responsible for many of the best known musical routines and songs for her husband . The best gags are developed on the Charles Chaplin imitations when Kaye is having lunch ; the events in the crowded room with several hosts that seem Marx brothers sketches ; in addition , the comic numbers in the military training headquarter . Support cast is frankly good , such as Elsa Lanchester , Barbara Bates , Gene Lockhart , Alan Hale , Néstor Paiva and Rhys Williams , among others . The motion picture was well directed by Henry Koster . Picture is a Kaye vehicle , and many consider his best comedy , he's an authentic comedian and real farceur . If you like Kaye's crazy interpretation , you will most definitely enjoy this one .

For a number of years after he continued his popularity without Goldwyn in films like Knock on Wood, The Court Jester and Merry Andrew. It is likely that The Court Jester is his best film, but The Inspector General is close to the top. Based on a 19th Century satiric play by Nicolai Gogol, Kaye plays Georgi, a decent fellow who works for the bullying Yakov (Walter Slezak). Yakov and Georgi travel around the countryside selling Yakov's elixir which is supposed to cure all kinds of illnesses (that Kaye sings in a tongue-twisting song by Sylvia Fine, his wife). But they are forced to flee when Georgi tries to stop an elderly woman from wasting her money on the elixir. Naturally Yakov is upset, and sends Georgi away until he learns to be crooked. Yakov has been using a fake official document signed by Napoleon as a come on in his sales pitch. Georgi is carrying it. He is arrested by the town constable (Alan Hale Sr.) for vagrancy, but the latter reads the letter. As the Mayor (Gene Lockhart) and his cohorts are awaiting (with dread) a visit by Napoleon's Inspector General to check their records (they have been feathering their nests), they think that Georgi is this Inspector General. When Yakov comes to town he quickly grasps the situation, and pretends he is the Inspector's servant. Slezak knows that there are real opportunities here.The funny thing is that Gogol's play is not quite like the film. First of all, Gogol was writing a critique of government corruption in the Russian Empire under Tsar Nicholas I (1825-1855). Gogol was a religious mystic and satirist (best recalled for his unfinished novel about serfdom, Dead Souls, and his novellas The Diary of a Madman and The Overcoat). Normally Nicholas was a humorless despot, who hated intellectuals. But he liked THE INSPECTOR GENERAL, which attacked the worst aspects of Russian local government corruptions that the Tsar did want to see eradicated. Because he approved, the play was a great success, and became one of the few 19th Century plays that became part of the permanent world repertory.But Gogol's targets were Russian, not French. Napoleon is not a background figure in the play. The Inspector General (actually the title is The Government Inspector in Russian) is from the Tsar. They have heard rumors of the corrupt practices, and are checking them. Georgi's character is not such a well-intentioned type in the play as he is in the movie. He is as willing to feather his nest as Yakob is, and they prove to be a highly successful team.This is because the Mayor and his cohorts are quite willing to bribe their way out of the current investigation. This includes selling the Mayor's wife for sex, and paying out much in bribes and gifts. And in the end, after Georgi and Yakob leave with their loot, the Mayor thinks he will be called to St. Petersburg for some really important post. But months later they hear of a letter circulating in the capital from Georgi boasting of how he fooled the Mayor and his cohorts. Then, just as things couldn't get worse, a servant announces the arrival of a Government Inspector to review the books. Everyone freezes in terror as the curtain falls. The film softens Georgi's character, leaving Yakov as the greedy one (although Slezak does redeem himself at the end). The Mayor and his cohorts (who do things like collecting for a church bell but pocketing the money themselves) do try to kill off the Inspector General - there is a funny sequence at a party where Georgi sings a song about sing Gypsy, dance Gypsy, and keeps on just avoiding drinking his doctored drink during the song. Georgi's guardian angel protects him. He also meets Leza, a servant (Barbara Bates) and falls for her. He debates how to appear before her as a General - should he be elegant like an Englishman, arrogant like a Russian, or smart like a German. In some ways Soliloquy for Three heads may be the best of the numbers in the film. Although watered down from Gogol's stunning comic play, enough entertainment value remains in the film to make it worthwhile viewing, and a highpoint in appreciating Kaye's movie career.

(The sequence where they try to sell their elixir is one of the movie's best scenes.)  Georgi visits a small town, where through a series of coincidences, he is mistaken by the town's leaders for the Inspector General, an important official with sweeping powers to punish and reform.  Half of the town fawns on him, while the other half panics over what he will discover in his inspection.  Kaye just wants to leave town before they figure out who he really is, but plenty of complications arise that keep things going for quite a while.Kaye gets to sing, dance, and generally entertain the audience.  The supporting cast is filled with fine character actors like Gene Lockhart, Elsa Lanchester, and Alan Hale, who add to the humor.  Not a lot of big laughs, but a steady stream of good-natured comedy all the way through.This is an enjoyable movie recommended for anyone who likes musical comedy.

Be it the silly patter songs, slapstick at its purest, his quick timing, his wide-eyed innocent reactions to the corruption of the councilmen, or his heartwarming moments of honesty and warmth. He will send kids and adults alike into fits of laughter with his antics, and makes a lovable and memorable figure out of what could have been a very dry character. It seems as though the director took Gogol's character and rewrote it specifically for Danny Kaye, a common practice in those days.But Kaye is not the only one in the movie that shines. The other characters may serve as foils to Georgi, but they in themselves are funny. Maria's constant overtures to Georgi, the poor councilman that is trying to resign but no one will let him, poor Kovatch who can't seem to hang onto a uniform, the twins who are constantly confusing Georgi, and especially wily Yakov. Yakov in himself is a great character, because he is a villain but in his despicably you can't help but admire his clever ways of keeping Georgi from getting caught. The obligatory love story is weak, yes, but in this case it is a good thing, because the real humor resides in this classic tale of mistaken identity, not in the love story. I rate this a nine out of ten because I really feel that the love story was unnecessary, although the love story does lend itself to a lovely song, true.Above all, this is Danny Kaye truly living up to his reputation as a superstar of his era, almost like the Chaplin of his time, only better since most of his talent shows in the patter songs and lines. He is supported by strong actors, and overall it makes a wonderful, classic film for the entire family.

Kaye is a poor slob who thinks he is going to be hanged by a corrupt town, but then events take place which I won't spoil in this review. Trust me, you won't stop laughing. The voting for this movie indicates men like it slightly more than women. Danny Kaye was a man's man, and his heroines were always men's women, the kind so perfectly beautiful that female viewers can't help but get jealous. Female viewers like the plain Jane as female leads, like in the movies of the last twenty years. In this movie, the lead female is one of the most gorgeous you'll ever see. Kaye always managed to get paired with the most beautiful girl in the show. Then there's Danny Kaye's pure talent. He sings not only with talent, but with affection and timing. Perfect comic genius makes him a delight to watch. And the rest of the cast is splendid. Not just one of the best comedies, but one of the best movies of all time.

The movie started off somewhat slowly, and took its time picking up the pace. However, the pace quickly picked up speed when Danny Kaye came on screen. This is partly because his partner shows up at the same time. Walter Slezak does a fantastic job of contrasting Kaye throughout the movie, but more of that later.Danny Kaye's performance here is not quite as seamless as many. He does not seem to have the same audacity he displays in later movies, such as The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and The Court Jester. It is also different in that, although it includes the usual confusion, plot twists, and multiplicity of plans going on at once, these elements are not executed as beautifully as in, for example, The Court Jester. Thus these scenes become comedic background, still enjoyable to watch, but not the masterpiece one may have become accustomed to. However, the movie was far from terrible. There were moments which, as I watched them, made me think, That's so Danny Kaye. He has many of the same mannerisms and little twitches that make him so much fun to watch, along with an array of songs that would tie a normal tongue in knots. He looks quite dashing in his military uniform, and his character's innocence is just so much fun to see in Danny Kaye's brilliant blue eyes. His character (Georgi) is also contrasted masterfully with Slezak's (Yakov), making this movie a success. Yakov is so mean to poor Georgi (as well as everyone else) that the viewer simply must fall in love with the poor boy. Kaye plays a young man, very nearly a boy, while Yakov is so jaded and immoral. It is Yakov's cruelty to Georgi that endears Kaye's character to the viewer.To sum up, The Inspector General is a lighthearted movie involving superb writing, excellent juxtaposition, and a wonderful star and supporting villain.

The Technicolor looks less than vibrant, but DANNY KAYE is the main reason for watching this anyway. He gets to do his thing in a variety of songs, the outstanding one being The Gypsy Drinking Song, another Happy Times penned by Sylvia Fine.He has the benefit here of excellent support from WALTER SLEZAK (a fake healer who, with Kaye, is a traveling salesman of his phony elixir), GENE LOCKHART (as a corrupt mayor), ALAN HALE, and especially ELSA LANCHESTER as the flirtatious woman who wants to run off with Kaye under the perception that he's The Inspector General. It's the usual crazy identity mix-up that has all the villagers thinking Kaye is the man about to expose corruption of the town's leaders.Kaye does all his usual song patters and double takes and mugging with his usual zest and skill and the vehicle is clearly tailor-made for his talent. True, it's overly silly at times and some of the routines are less than witty, but he's still fun to watch as he dodges the poisoned drink and swaggers through his impersonation while really trying to escape the clutches of the law.Best watched if you can find a good print--entertaining fluff with Kaye and Slezak obviously enjoying themselves.

The Inspector General is one of those real Danny Kaye movies. I think that most of the youngsters of this time don't know him or haven't ever heard of him, that thought makes me sad, because I am 15 and he is my idol. Danny Kaye, what can I say about this great man. In this movie he shows great acting, singing and dancing. He accidentally becomes the inspector-general of a town called Brodny. Before this he sold special drinks with Yacov a gipsy (Walter Slezak) that should crack you up but it is actually poisoned. The mayor and his men want Georgi(Danny Kaye) dead so that they can climb to higher places. Georgi met a girl named Leza(Barbara Bates) who worked as a kind of a maid in the house of the inspector-general. First she didn't really like him but when he began to sing a wonderful song to her(Happy Times), she was already starting to love him. Meanwhile Georgi is concerned about how he should handle with this confusing situation. He can't believe he is the inspector-general. A lot of humour follows. At last the real inspector-general turns back to Brodny from a visit to the emperor (I thought) and soon Georgi and Yacov, who gave Georgi 'advice'(he wanted him actually dead so that he could get a lot of money from the townleaders)are caught and would soon be hanged. The real inspector-general and his men come to the jail to take Georgi and Yacov outside to kill them. Yacov made it to steal the papers of the inspector-general and gave them to Georgi so that all the people think again that he is the inspector-general, but Georgi admits he isn't the inspector-general and admits that he can't even read or write. The real inspector-general appreciates this so much he let them go and makes Georgi mayor and Yacov a very high soldier. So this story knows a happy end. The songs Hail to Brodny, Happy Times, Yacov's Elixer, Arrogant, Elegant, Smart and the Gipsy Drinking Song touched me very much and are of course written by Sylvia Fine. A great movie with a very good cast.

Georgi (Kaye) is an illiterate member of a traveling medicine show who is mistaken by a small Russian village as the Inspector General, a royal official with vast powers. While the local government officials plot to bribe or kill him, Georgi ingrains himself into the public's favor all the while trying to find a way out of his situation, according to the DVD sleeve description.Mr. Kaye's films usually fall into one of two categories - they can either be enjoyed by almost everyone in the average film-going public, or they mainly appeal to those already inclined to admire Kaye. The latter films will sometimes show the strains of a story showcase vehicle, while the more universally appealing films feature Kaye using his skills to more naturally essay a character. The Inspector General is a good example of the latter. Many of the gags fall flat, and the plot is laboriously adapted from the satirical Russian classic.

It's a cinematic adaptation of Nikolai Gogol's ascerbic 1842 satire of Russian feudal society, and is so definitive that it's never been remade. Naturally, mores have moved on (blunt brutality and gallows humour are no longer funny) but its datedness is mostly just requisite atavism.The carnival musicians (who may have invented modern beat-boxing(!)) are a standout, especially their lackadaisical Hey guy. Their comical Gypsy music conveys the story's shrewd/wily cynicism and serves to skewer provincialism as Gogol intended.Transposing the setting to Hungary introduces newer audiences to the story of an illiterate carnival entertainer mistaken for the Emperor's emissary--although referencing Napoleon gets problematic.The Mayor of Klimenti (Nestor Paiva of Zorro serials fame, d.1966) kick-starts the plot, riding madly into his cousin's town of Brodny. I must go; even now he (the Inspector-General) may be here, in your midst, he blurts breathlessly amidst gulps of brandy. You almost feel sorry for him--until you see WHY his cape bulges. His Cousin Biro(Gene Lockhart) (biro in Hungarian means judge) is in no less trouble--the Inspector-General's incognito technique would trap Brodny's Mayor just the same.Director Henry Koster's genius is in revealing Brodny as only seemingly less corrupt its apparent civil order (repressed obedience) is exacted through institutionalised, class-based petty violence. When Biro brutally slaps Kovacs, the Captain of Police(Alan Hale), Koster has this start an unforgettable domino-chain of slaps down all the way to livestock.This prologue, then, impels the police to fan out patrolling all roads to Brodny and coming upon Yakov Goury's travelling Gypsy show. Georgi(Kaye) is its talented but naïve (Maybe I can't read or write, but I'm not illiterate!) and pointedly illiterate headliner flogging the snake-oil. Kaye is cute, if silly, twitching ears on cue. Since 1940 his verbal gymnastics were created by his equally talented wife, Associate Producer Sylvia Fine.One fleece-show act calls for a sickly young man with a prescription for Rix-zz-jel-knoobtz-f-f-ss-ch-ch-enn-zelminheltzigner......-Twice a day. Kaye's warm delivery conveys perfectly that doctors haven't written legibly.....ever. This prescription turns out to be Yakov's Golden Elixir. A hapless innocent, Georgi's main problem (apart from being illiterate) is that he has a conscience--a right nuisance for a con-man. His ruthless, dog-eat-dog world boss Yakov(Walter Slezak, seemingly born into the role) is instead a shifty chameleon who can actually read.Undermined by Georgi's conscience for the last time, Yakov brutally rejects his frontman after the locals riot. Homeless, hungry (Yakov confiscated the one fish he caught) and with holes in his boots, Georgi takes to the road. (Note The rider who overtakes him is rearranged footage--it no longer makes sense as Gregor, mid-flight to Brodny.) Although this adaptation still captures Gogol's wily logic, there are (another) two on screen elements that don't jibe 1. Georgi's tearing the Emperor's testimonial in half to pad his shoe. Despite needing padding, he throws one half away! This cause of his later mistaken identity beggars belief.2. Another is the substitution of Napoleon for the Emperor, when Gogol was famously scathing of Tsar Nicholas' Russian Empire. Presumably the Hungarian relocation and name-changes also account for this bizarre 1949 American oversensitivity to Tsarist Russia! The point of Gogol's shrewd observation was that authority resides in the eyes of (corrupt) beholders; and so the Brodny officials quickly jump to conclusions of Why not a tramp? Georgi's prison stay proves fateful, as he hysterically waves his boot at his captors, dislodging the remaining half of Yakov's forgery. Alan Hale has a wonderful bit goggling at the fake testimonial .....continue in this fine work to rid our land of the many evils that plague it.....Napoleon.Gene Lockhart embodies the Mayor with suitably high-strung, twitching pique. He's at the epicentre of his annoying relatives' idiosynchracies, who fill all the public service jobs; the problem with nepotism being that he can never get away from them! The running gag with the twin postmasters (real twins Sam and Lew Hearn) just compounds the Mayor's hilariously put-upon paternalism.Meanwhile, our genteel coward's three-day starvation had set up several plot devices his encounter with the foul soldiers ensures the confusion of the robbery (Hey! I'm innocent--ask the horse!); and Georgi's outraged cries about informing the Emperor now sound vaguely plausible. However, the classic food-hoarding scene exists just for laughs the payoff to his overeating is the gag about what he's offered to counteract his indigestion.Once the Brodny officials discover and attire him (repeatedly) in poor Kovacs' uniform, he's fawned over by everyone--including the Mayor's hilariously vapid wife Maria(Elsa Lanchester, never better). He's a hit singing the Golden-Globe-winning Gypsy_Drinking_Song, and rounding ....Now dis graop here, I vill make for you, shtok-shtok.....Very pret-yie, I laove you to pieces.Incongruous Russian accent notwithstanding, his biggest test turns up in the guise of a long-lost, snow-blind, dotty old general. Luckily, no-one except his resurfaced partner Yakov knows he's a fake, and it's Yakov who presses him into service as the Inspector-General (to blackmail the corrupt officials). Suddenly Georgi must discover how to really act the part. Afraid that a tear in the eye is worth two in the bush, he ponders Whose head will they jerk, whose block will they knock off? He even tries to resign in a touching letter to Yakov, but he's so popular, having captured Brodny's hopes for justice, that the officials get desperate to be rid of him--by any means necessary. One memorable scene has even Kovacs resorting to bribery, squirming in a roomful of secreted officials You see, my wife isn't a contended woman.....oh, I love my family but I'd give my six kids to get rid of my wife! The clichéd church-organ subplot remains underdeveloped, becoming annoying, and telegraphing that, well, we've seen the best already. From then it's just a rush to a fairytale ending.Merely second-best of Danny Kaye movies; see The Court Jester(1956).

The play is about how a group of corrupt officials on a small Russian town in the 19th century hear that somebody is coming from St Petersburg (the then Russian capital) to perform a audit on the town's accounts, so they end up rushing about in a panic to try and cover up their nefarious deeds. Then enters a lowly clerk on a holiday and they immediately believe that he is the auditor and go out of their way to soften him up and offer him bribes.The movie differs from a play a little (and is a little be more slapstick, but then again I have not seen it performed so I cannot comment on that aspect of it) in that the clerk is replaced by an out of work con-man (because he does not like deceiving people) and the play has a much happier ending. In fact the clerk in this film is a much more honest individual than the original in the play (who scampers out of town quick fast when he is discovered). Also, the clerk (for want of a better word because in the movie he is actually homeless and destitute and wonders into the town having not eaten for two days).The movie is also set in some vague European Village in some vague empire because at one point it is suggested that the Emperor if Napoleon, and at another point it is said that the capital city is Budapest (which is a huge continuity error because Budapest was never the main capital of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and Napoleon never had his capital in Budapest (he was French, so it was always going to be Paris). However, putting aside that minor problem, and the fact that the main character is much, much nicer in this movie than in the play, it is still a pretty good rendition, and enjoyable to watch.

Some, of course, probably still love Kaye and adore his antics and musical routines. And, others, like myself, will find him tedious. When he sings and makes his silly grimaces, it pains me--which is a shame, as the plot itself of The Inspector General is actually pretty good.Danny plays Georgi--a poor and slightly crooked man. He assists in a patent medicine show run by a seriously crooked guy (Walter Slezak). When he loses this job, he's very hungry and manages to get arrested--but not a meal. However, when the townspeople mistakenly believe that he's the Inspector General in disguise, suddenly they begin lavishing him with praise and gifts. But, the mayor and his officers know that they must do something else--they must kill the Inspector General to keep their thieving ways a secret. This isn't a problem for Kaye, as he's about to run out of town as soon as humanly possible--but he can't when his old boss shows up and insists that Kaye stay and milk the town for all it's worth.If the film was a bit more subtle, I would have loved it. It did have a lot of clever moments--but it also had Kaye hamming it up something awful at times as well. Overall, a mixed bag--worth seeing but lacking at the same time. "},{"Title":"Not as Silly as Some Might Think.","Date":"9 September 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Musical, Romance","Review":" It's a little difficult to grasp the notion of Danny Kaye, one of his era's premier farceurs, being the lead in a story from the 1840s by a Russian dramatist. We all know those Russian plays had more clouds of gray than any song by George Gershwin could guarantee. But, though I haven't read Gogol's story, he was one of those gloomy Russkies who happened to have a sense of humor, sarcastic and cynical though it might have been.It's the Napoleonic era in Middle Europe. Every town in the regime is corrupt in varying degrees and Napoleon has sent an Inspector General to clean things up. The Inspector General has Napoleon's power of attorney. He generally enters a town in some humble disguise -- a tinker, a salesman, an utter nobody -- then snoops around until he uncovers the miscreants, who he then promptly hangs. Nobody knows what he looks like.Kaye is a shill for a snake oil salesman, Walter Slezak in the most outrageously villainous bad-guy make up since Mack Swain, Chaplin's gorilla. When Kaye tries to stop an old lady from spending all her money on Slezak's cure-all to save her dying husband -- it's really furniture polish -- Slezak overhears the conversation and kicks Kaye out.Kaye then turns into a starving tramp. He wanders from town to town, trying to steal bits of food from dogs. But in the village of Brodny, misleading evidence comes to light that he is the Inspector General in disguise. So instead of being hanged for a thief, he's feted by the terrified corrupt town officials. He spends most of the movie strutting around in resplendent garb, trying to imitate a self-possessed pal of Napoleon or, alternatively, trying desperately to have his real identity hidden from the public. This spoiled identity becomes especially problematic after Slezak shows up, recognizes him for the buffoon he is, and manipulates him to extort bribes from the officials.Kaye handles the role pretty well, actually, as unlikely as it sounds. Well, why not? So it's a farce. I doubt that Gogol's original play had the fake Inspector General singing gibberish songs, but somehow it fits. Kaye's usual cowardly and neurotic persona is imposed on what I imagine to have been an amusing but relatively grounded story. If W. C. Fields could play Mr. Micawber in Charles Dickens' David Copperfield, why not Kaye as a jiggling and stuttering Inspector General? The plot is too logical to allow for many of Kaye's set pieces. The gibberish songs (by his then-wife, Sylvia Fine) aren't as funny as some of his earlier ones. The gags, though muted, are imposed on a narrative that is funny in itself and this makes up, to some extent, for our watching a Danny Kaye who is in harness to the plot.There isn't as much mindless sentiment as there were in some of Kaye's lesser vehicles -- no sick children or any of that crap. Barbara Bates as the housemaid is Kaye's love interest, such as it is. Bates, an exquisite young woman of modest talent, was the underhanded high-school girl Phoebe who shows up at the end of All About Eve. Here, in period wardrobe, she's just another pretty face, but it doesn't matter because her part isn't particularly important.Anyway, I kind of enjoyed it. Kaye does a lot of jumping around and shuffling of objects and there are some laughs in it, desperately needed in these too-laughless times.

Too many silly songs which don't do justice to his fine voice and a weak plot line. The Court Jester and Walter Mitty are far superior. However, the finest Danny Kaye film in my humble view is Hans Christian Anderson. The stories of Anderson are timeless and the songs in the film were big hits at the time and have since become classics (Inch Worm, Ugly Duckling, Thumbellina, I'm Hans Christian Anderson, etc.). Danny Kaye was a crooner almost in the Crosby class and his talents are wasted in the Inspector General. The odd silly song is o.k, but there are too many in this film.

It is awfully silly at times, with over-the-top jokes and various excesses, but it makes pretty good viewing in general. Well-used sound effects plus apt costumes and sets help enhance the experience too. It takes a while to warm up, and some of the time old elements are thrown in to not much avail, such as a typical love subplot, but if one is to take the film lightheartedly it is quite amusing, even if some of Kaye's skits go a bit overboard.

Kaye plays an illiterate toady of a medicine-show operator who is confused with the Emperor's Inspector General who is charged with the duty to root out all corruption in any village to which he is sent. The venal mayor and his coterie of dishonest city bosses are scared out of their wits as they seek to cover up their corruption from the all-knowing imperial emissary. Corrupt as they are, and scared of the consequences of being exposed, they expose Georgi (Kaye) to every peril possible -- including having to drink some of Yakov's Golden elixir that his boss Yakov (Walter Slezak) vends to unsuspecting suckers. He survives every danger, including bad advice from those who exploit his illiteracy.There's much grimness in the humor, so it's not for everyone, including several references to executions -- and some about the jail. One memorable line is from one of the crooked city bosses (sorry, not an exact quote)    They'll send us to the firing squad!followed by    Don't worry. I own the factory that makes the guns.If you can put up with such jests, then you will like this movie. Beware, though it is not for children.

Kaye suited the part very well and Warner Brothers provided him with a generous cast of familiar character players. Kaye brings a lot of laughs as well as pathos to the part of the poor illiterate schnook who is a stooge for Walter Slezak, an itinerant peddler of snake oil known as Yakov's Elixir. After they get thrown out of one town due to Kaye's bumbling, Slezak cuts him adrift.But our Danny falls into a gold mine in the next town as he arrives there poor and hungry. It seems as though the city fathers have gotten word that The Inspector General, personal emissary of the Emperor is coming to town and he's been known to go places incognito and then reveal himself and all the fraud he uncovers.The paranoid city fathers of Brodny who include such people as Gene Lockhart, Alan Hale, Byron Foulger all start fawning all over Kaye who decides to just go with the flow. That policy is encouraged by Slezak who arrives in Brodny and sees the great possibilities here.The Inspector General is one of my favorite films with Danny Kaye, he's so right for the part. This was his first film away from Sam Goldwyn and Warner Brothers managed to give this film the same kind of production values you would find in a Goldwyn production. Mrs. Kaye, aka Sylvia Fine wrote the score for The Inspector General and gave her husband one of his best film songs, Happy Times which he sings to Barbara Bates who plays a serving girl at the local inn. Kaye also has to fend off the amorous advances of Elsa Lanchester who is Lockhart's wife and who is no slouch at getting a few laughs herself.The Inspector General is a timeless classic, taken from a classic and is one of the best showcases for the many talents of Danny Kaye.

But even so, it's a really fun movie. Danny Kaye provides a lot of fun as a illiterate drifter who gets mistaken for a government inspector in a town overrun with corruption in Napoleon-era France. There are a couple of scenes in the movie that truly elicit a lot of humor, and the songs -- which Kaye's wife Sylvia wrote -- just go to show what one can do with a language. There are a few slow scenes, but mostly it's a really entertaining piece of work. I'm going to have to see if I can find a production of Gogol's original play (called Revizor in Russian, often called The Government Inspector in English).Also starring Walter Slezak (the Clock King on the 1960s Batman show), Gene Lockhart, Barbara Bates, Elsa Lanchester (the Bride of Frankenstein), Alan Hale Sr. (yes, the Skipper's father) and Rhys Williams.PS Another one of Nikolai Gogol's notable stories is the horror short story Viy, which Mario Bava filmed as Black Sunday starring Barbara Steele.

Of course, the town's officials, thoroughly corrupt to the core, are terrified by his presence and do everything they can to impress him and throw him off their trail. Georgi meanwhile is thoroughly confused but not above accepting the good hospitality especially given how hungry and down on his luck he's been. Of course, being an Inspector General also means you're a target and much danger looms for Georgi.No mistaking this is the Danny Kaye show all the way. The rest of the cast including Elsa Lancaster, Gene Lockhart, Alan Hale and Walter Slezak are all good no doubt but it's Kaye's singing, dancing and comedy routines that prove this film's main focus. How much you enjoy it probably depends on how much you enjoy Kaye's brand of humor. I have to admit at times it goes on much too long, almost to the point of annoyance, but there's a kind of innocence about Kaye's Georgi character here that one is able to ultimately forgive this more often than not. Favorite bits The Be Arrogant, Be Elegant, Be Smart section and the Gyspy drinking song.

It was an easier, simpler time for entertainers, when slapstick was king and The Three Stooges and Abbott & Costello were the gold standard, with the later rise & fall of the Smothers Brothers marking the end of that era.But there were also the sort of more subtle gag lines and themes that still appeal to our more developed, sophisticated senses of humor. A fine example of this, alone worth the price of admission to this film, is where one of those corrupt officials, noted in other comments above, at first repeats about Georgi, Less and less I like this Yakobovich...! but as time goes on, and Georgi wins hearts & minds, his tune changes to repeating, More and more I like this Yakobovich! Gogol's original play was a bitter satire about corruption in Tsarist Russia, a theme and storyline that would likely puzzle Western audiences. Perhaps the greater familiarity of Napoleon as the Emperor in place of the Tsar -- also an emperor -- inspired the screenplay author to change the setting from Russia to some vague 'Eastern European' town, retaining the Russian names & even pseudo-accent, that may have fallen into Napoleon's empire for a while; making this film less about the Russian (pre-Soviet-Communist-during-the-Cold-War) Bear than about the rampant silliness of pervasive small-town petty and not-so-petty corruption even as still practiced today in many small towns in America. A fine farce based on real life in Russia originally, in mythical small towns in Europe then, and in our very real home towns today Over centuries and across millions of miles, only the names on the doors have changed; from big city graft to small town vice, the only real difference is in the size of the numbers.Some say this movie is merely a vehicle for Danny Kaye; actually, only Danny Kaye could make us laugh at all the routine petty criminality encompassed in the saying, You can't fight City Hall. All you need to do to ENJOY this wonderful timeless parody of malodorous malingering municipal malapropism & malfeasances is to willingly suspend any modern expectation of & insistence upon sophisticated authenticity & realism.

After seeing this movie, all I have to say about that is BLECH!!!I watched this movie because I'm a huge Elsa Lanchester fan, and am willing to watch anything she's in. The character she played in this movie was a total ninny (the mayor's wife who, along with the rest of the town, mistook Danny Kaye for the Inspector General and who was trying to get Danny to run away with her). The role was completely beneath Elsa, but as always she managed to shine in every scene she was in, even given such mediocre material.As for Danny Kaye .... OMG, I wanted to shoot my TV! He's in practically every scene and I don't think the man ever heard of the word subtlety. He hams and mugs his way through every scene. Some people may find him endearing, but I found him nauseating and annoying. I'll be sure to steer clear of any and all Danny Kaye movies in the future!The story is decent enough (light farce), there's some singing and comedy and feel-good human decency and a love story .... in other words, something for everyone, and everything but the kitchen sink!My rating 4/10 "}]
