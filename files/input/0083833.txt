Friends are not friends by just saying nice things to each other, rather because they have shared their adolescent lives with one another, and the realization of adulthood sparks an indispensable fondness all of the major characters in the film mutually share!! At a glance, someone may perceive this film to be a movie version of Happy Days...but the intense and poignant performances of all the characters in the film (particularly Steve Guttenberg's) makes anyone who sees this movie wonder if maybe it would have been nice to live in Baltimore in 1959!!!Usually, there is a pejorative interpretation of the term IMMATURE, but in this film, it establishes a social cohesiveness that reflects the enviable naivety of the times!!!...Everybody recognizes everyone else's preventable flaws...The proverbial friendship safety net which perennially prevails throughout this entire film, makes them feel very fortunate because they know that their lives are not perfect!!!..Their precociousness resonates itself to a bittersweet comedy, and is advocated as such, since comedy is limitless, because so too is human error...Evaluating the actors in the movie, it is simply incredible!! Steve Guttenberg is Police Academy King!! Tim Daley in the hit show Wings He seemed to understand that role perfectly!! Kevin Bacon, the eighties icon including Footloose Daniel Stern, the director and voice in Wonder Years Mickey Rourke 9 1/2 Weeks Every male between the ages of 42 and 50 is insanely jealous!! Ellen Barkin The Big Easy and a host of others!! and of course, Paul Reiser Mad About You...Acting talent of this copious quantity exudes a plethora of non disputable top notch Hollywood entertainment!! All of the actors in this film established a compilation of feelings that were genuine, for better or for worse (pun intended!!).. Memories were safeguarded to make the recognizable distinction between friends and acquaintances!! Life was irksome at times, but they always sought respite!! The boys/men knew they could attain refuge and solace at the Diner!! Be it from eating French Fries with gravy, expounding about first experiences, bickering over nothing whatsoever, and most significantly, thoroughly and completely understanding each other!!! No matter what happens they will always have the Diner!! How many films put a realistically humorous spin on adversity!! How many films provide a humanistic heartfelt laughter about everything!! More importantly!! What films make you realize truly that people make all the difference in your life!! Diner was indeed such a film!! All of the actors in this movie have had tremendous careers, and this movie is testimony as to why!! When evaluating your life, you realize how trite imperfections are the only valid means of appreciating your precarious endeavors, and your concise perception of what adolescence transitioning into adulthood truly signifies!! It is a wonderful experience when a film far exceeds your expectations and puts an acute awareness on what matters in your life!! With the Rolls Royce of directors/writers Barry Levinson, (Natural, Rain Man & Good Morning Vietnam, to name but a few!!) and an absolutely fabulous cast, (if a director ever wants a young cast with a cop esthetically emerging potential like this one ever again, he will have to get it from the guy with the red horns!!!) this film is one of the finest!!!! Top 20 in my book and top 30 for comedies according to the critics of AFI!!!!

A generation ago, however, the tendency was to take a more sympathetic, nostalgic look at the fifties in films such as 'Grease' or television programmes such as 'Happy Days'. The post-Vietnam generation seemed to look back at the period immediately before that war as a lost age of innocence. 'Diner' follows a group of young men from Baltimore, former school friends now in their early twenties, over a week of their lives, that between Christmas Eve and New Year, 1959. Some of them are still living and working in the town, others are now at college, but are using the Christmas vacation as a chance to get back together with old friends. The title is taken from the diner that is their favourite meeting-place. There is no real coherent plot; the film is very episodic in structure and concentrates on character rather than on action. As is perhaps inevitable with young men of this age, many of their preoccupations are with girls and relationships. One of them, Shrevie, is married, but seems to be discontented with married life. Another, Eddie, is engaged. A third, Billy, discovers during the course of the film that he has got his girlfriend pregnant, but when he offers to do the decent thing by her, he is disconcerted to realize that she would much rather he did the indecent one. A fourth, Boogie, seems to lead a carefree life, flitting from one romance to another. The characters are not, however, preoccupied with love and sex to the exclusion of all else. We also learn about their other private obsessions with such matters as music, sport and the cinema. Shrevie quarrels with his wife because she does not share his passion for popular music and fails to understand his complex system for cataloguing his extensive record collection. (I wonder if this scene was the origin of a similarly obsessive character in 'High Fidelity'). Eddie's passion for sport is even more all-consuming than Shrevie's for music; he subjects his fiancée Elyse to a football quiz and threatens to break off the engagement if she cannot score a sufficiently high score. A minor character knows off by heart the entire dialogue from the film 'Sweet Smell of Success'.Many of the young actors who starred in the film have gone on to become famous names in the movie world. From my point of view the best was probably Kevin Bacon as Timothy, the rebel without a cause who has dropped out of his wealthy family and lives an aimless life. (The first time we see him he is smashing windows just for the hell of it). I was, however, also impressed by Daniel Stern as Shrevie and Mickey Rourke as Boogie. I have never been to Baltimore, but it was clear from watching the film that the director was trying to capture the spirit of a particular place and time. It therefore came as no surprise to discover that Barry Levinson, who both wrote and directed the film, is himself a Baltimore native, although slightly younger than the characters depicted in the film. (He would have been seventeen in 1959). Despite this concentration on the particular, however, 'Diner' has a universal appeal. The film with which it has most in common is 'American Graffiti'. Although that film was actually set in the early sixties rather than the fifties, it nevertheless deals quite openly with the idea of the pre-Vietnam era as a golden age. 'Diner' does not deal with this theme so overtly, but there is still nevertheless a distinct sense of an era coming to an end. It is significantly set in the final week of a decade, and in the wedding scene we see a large banner saying 'Eddie and Elyse- in the sixties and forever', a reminder that change is on the way, both for these young men and for America as a whole. The most important change that the characters in 'Diner' have to come to terms with is neither social nor political, but rather the challenge of growing up. The traditional 'Coming of Age' film has tended to concentrate on adolescence and the teenage years. For many young men, however, their early twenties, when they are completing or have already completed their education, are setting out on their careers and are starting to think about more serious relationships with women, can be a time of even greater changes than their days in secondary school. All the major characters- except perhaps the serious-minded Billy who is keen to accept new responsibilities- want to hang on to elements of their boyhood even while moving into adulthood. For Boogie, and, to an even greater degree, Timothy, this means keeping the freedom to be irresponsible. For Shrevie and Eddie, this means trying to keep hold of their youthful passions even after marriage. The discord between Shrevie and his wife (slightly older than him and considerably more mature in outlook) is caused as much by his fear that marriage will mean having to give up his association with his old friends as by her inability to differentiate between jazz and rock-and-roll. Barry Levinson's claim that Elyse's football test was based on a true incident may seem improbable, but there is some psychological truth in this part of the film. It has, after all, been said that every man's ideal woman is himself incarnated in the body of a beautiful girl, and Elyse's willingness to take this test shows that she is prepared to make sacrifices and enter into Eddie's male-oriented world. 'Diner' is a film worth seeing more than once. On my first viewing I found it dull, an inferior copy of 'American Graffiti'. The second time round, I started to appreciate it as a fine film in its own right. Barry Levinson has gone on to make a number of other good films ('The Natural', 'Good Morning Vietnam', 'Rain Man' and 'Sleepers'), but 'Diner', his first film, is perhaps his most personal and heartfelt. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Strong dialogue and believable characters taking precedence over stupid action and obnoxious caricatures.","Date":"25 April 2004","Score":"31 out of 42 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Note This review has been severely chopped to comply with IMDb's word limit. Full review can be found at wiredonmovies.com--There's not that much of a story, really. What do we do? We drive around. Maybe he's going to get married, maybe not. It's really more about the fact that it's a very honest portrayal of a group...of guys that people relate to on a very personal level.- Kevin Bacon on the Diner DVD interview reelIn the opening scene of Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, a handful of characters debate the true meaning of Madonna's hit song Like a Virgin. Long before Reservoir Dogs (a decade, to be exact), there was Barry Levinson's directorial debut, Diner, a coming-of-age tale concerning five Baltimore residents in their 20s who try to get past crucial points in their lives. In a similar scene to that in Tarantino's masterpiece, four friends -- played by Steve Guttenberg, Mickey Rourke, Daniel Stern, and Paul Reiser -- argue over which singer produces better make-out music Mathis or Sinatra? Presley, says Rourke's character, ending the conversation with blunt confidence. And that's that.The movie has plentiful rich dialogue, some of it seemingly pointless, most of it subtly touching and meaningful. The film has a lot to say about the difference between friendship and true love. I love you, one of the characters tells the woman he wants to marry. Fixated on an object behind him, her eyes cold and a grim reflection of deep contemplation, she replies, You're confusing a friendship with a woman, and love. It's not the same. In a very different sort of way, it tackles the same material as When Harry Met Sally, but it doesn't stop there.The film is masterful in its ability to present us with a group of people we sincerely care for, and who all seem very real -- more so than the characters you'll find in most movies. The dialogue was primarily improvised, especially by Paul Reiser, whose debates with fellow pals are the highlights of the film. Even after the truly poignant ending there is a discussion about evolution that plays over the credits. Did you hear about this evolution stuff? Reiser asks. He starts to mock the theories which would later become widely considered as truth by scientists, despite lack of actual evidence supporting the theory. Amusing, how the movie has so much to say about so many different things.Diner is a film that connects with us because we can all sympathize with its characters and their inner motivations. Eddie (Guttenberg) is afraid of getting married; Schrezie (Stern) is married and wishes he wasn't; Boogie (Rourke) would like to finally find a girl he could respect; Bill (Timothy Daly) wants to get married to the girl he loves but she doesn't want to. The whole movie appears to be focused on girls, and indeed most of it is, yet there's a lot of other stuff that's even deeper. Fenwick (Bacon) is what Bacon himself described as a permanently drunk, sick kid who doesn't know what he wants out of life, thrown out of his family and wandering the streets looking for a meaning to his life. He's the character who is so lost he doesn't even seem to care very much about girls.Prior to Diner, Levinson was a nobody -- and perhaps that is why his first project is that most in tune with its characters and their natures. The movie was very risky when the studio released it in 1982 -- there was talk of shelving the finished product for fear of losing money. Reluctant, MGM finally released the movie into theaters, but with poor advertising -- it tanked. Yet it received some of the greatest reviews of the year. In an effort to convince MGM, Levinson showed a screening of the movie to critic Pauline Kael, who gave it an exceptional review, as did the majority of critics at that time. On the surface, Diner seems rather boring -- it's just a movie about nothing, really, except growing up. Yet it captured the hearts of many, becoming a cult sleeper that still entices new fans to this very day.It's a film of many integrating mixed genres, each one carefully balanced and perfectly maintained throughout. Diner has some of the best dialogue of all time, not to mention a handful of Oscar-worthy performances. This is not Levinson's best but it's one of his most deeply touching projects. It has a lot to say about many things and it actually gets around to addressing them -- which is rare to find in any movie. This is a true gem. "},{"Title":"There's not that much of a story, really. What do we do? We drive around... Kevin Bacon","Date":"17 September 2008","Score":"20 out of 23 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Diner, Barry Levinson's writing and directing debut belongs to so-called small or minor movies and it indeed does not have spectacular locations, breathtaking action sequences or even dramatic story. As Kevin Bacon comments in the Behind the Scenes Documentary, There's not that much of a story, really. What do we do? We drive around... What the movie has is a very honest portrayal of a group...of guys that people relate to on a very personal level. The different generations of viewers react to film with devotion and recognition, and Diner has become one of the beloved long time cult favorites. Based on its writer/director's memories of growing up in Baltimore, the film takes place during the week between Christmas and New Year in 1959, and tells of the friendship of five guys in their early twenties. During the course of the film, we will get to know the young men, their fears of growing up, facing responsibilities, and making decisions, their fascination and insecurities with the girls.From his Oscar-nominated script, BL makes the study of young men who hesitate to grow up but rather hang out in their beloved Diner. Daniel Stern's 'Shrevie' is an owner of LP collection that he seems to value more than his young and pretty wife (Ellen Barkin in her film debut). Mickey Rourke, played his best role (at least, IMO) as Boogy, the cynical womanizer with the most charming smile. Steve Guttenberg's Eddie puts his fiancée through the enormously difficult football quiz and the passing score is the must for the marriage because he is scared to get married. Kevin Bacon plays Fenwick, a permanently drunk and lost kid, the character much darker than the rest of the guys. Timothy Daly is Bill who seems to be the most successful of the bunch, and know what he wants but can't make the girl he loves to love him. By making Diner, Levinson actually put his native city, sleepy and provincial 1959 Baltimore, on the cinema map, and that's just one of movie's pleasures. And there are plenty. Diner is filled with authentic and believable scenes, situations, and conversations that everyone can relate to. The Diner's menu has a lot to offer to the grateful viewers and fans of the insightful, ironic, entertaining, small but bright and shiny gem. Barry Levinson does not flatter six protagonists but he understands them and loves them because he sees in them the indelible part of his own life, his experiences, and his own childhood friends. As another great film about childhood friendship says, I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone? Barry Levinson went on to create many good and very good films after Diner. These are just a few The Natural, Good Morning, Vietnam; Bugsy; Avalon; Sleepers, An Everlasting Piece, Disclosure, Wag the Dog, and his Oscar winner Rain Man but Diner will always have a very special place for me. This is the film I keep coming back to again and again, and as the time passes it only gets better. "},{"Title":"Just say it!  'I want the roast beef sandwich!'","Date":"3 April 2003","Score":"21 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  Diner is a fun-filled, perfectly inspired comedy/drama, which is talented director Barry Levinson's first effort.  Needless to say, there's no strong plot structure, but when you have solid, memorable characters like these, that's not necessary.  Almost every one of these characters are memorable in their own ways.  Nobody steals the show.  The cast is highly spirited, as I sensed great joy in their performances.  The chemistry between the characters is very genuine, and not surprisingly Barry Levinson made sure the actors got well-acquainted with each other before shooting.  I can tell Levinson based many of these scenarios on real-life situations.  Scenes like these cannot be developed in the mind of some phony Hollywood hack screenwriter.  The nostalgia practically bleeds out the screen, in his solid attention to detail.  And that's one of the reasons why this film works.  I can actually imagine Levinson sitting back and watching the film with a big smile, chuckling intermittently as he reminisces back to moments from his adolescence.  When a director is joyful about his work, that joy transfers to his audience.  One of the scenes in which that joy is most evident is when Daniel Stern's character throws a fit about his girlfriend, Ellen Barkin, wrongly categorizing his records and never asking him what's on the flip side?  Levinson obviously has a passion for the music of his time, and rightfully so, because a lot of great music comes from the 50's.  And lucky for me, the film's soundtrack is filled with many of those great tunes.      There are many memorable moments and lines of dialogue.  The football quiz is definitely something to be remembered.  But my favorite is the famous roast beef sandwich argument.  Paul Reiser asks Steve Guttenberg if that's a roast beef sandwich he's eating, and Guttenberg can sense he wants a bite from the sandwich, so he yells out, Just say it!  'I want the roast beef sandwich!'  It's a brilliant, Seinfeld-type scene which revolves around a banal subject, but you can't help but be delightfully amused, because let's fact it--the things we relate most to are the simple things in life.  Movies about politics can be interesting, but what if you're not a politician or someone who doesn't give a damn about politics?  Eating is someone everyone can relate to.  Friendship is something everything can relate to.  And male bonding is something all men can relate to.  If Waiting to Exhale best demonstrates the strength of female bonding, I feel this film best demonstrates the strength of male bonding.  I used to feel that women had a stronger bond, since they're more affectionate and in touch with their feelings.  But when jealousy enters the equation, even the most long-term friendship between two women can be butchered.  I've actually talked to several women who feel more comfortable with male friends, and don't very much trust other women.  However, guys stick together.  We may badmouth each other left and right and bust each other's chops, but the bond remains the same.  Some females may interpret this is as a misogynistic film, because other than Ellen Barkin's character, there are no major or supporting female characters.  And Steve Guttenberg's would-be wife is never revealed--at least her face is never shown.  But this is simply to stress the theme of male bonding; not to show that women aren't important.Diner is a film for those who enjoy funny, moving, character-driven nostalgia films with fine actors.  Hell, even Mickey Rourke, who I'm not a big fan of, gives a fine three-dimensional performance.  But everyone in the cast is worth praising in equal doses  Daniel Stern, Paul Reiser (despite his brief screen time), Kevin Bacon, Steve Guttenberg, Tim Daly, Ellen Barkin.

What's That?","Date":"4 February 2010","Score":"10 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Who realized that back in 1982, a film like Diner would possess such an extraordinary wealth of talent, both on and off the screen. What was emphasized by this film's director, (Barry Levenson) was the impetuousness with which this movie's actors and actresses had to orchestrate. So often, during the film's production, Barry did not even say ACTION to commence a scene. So many times, would Levenson omit the word CUT for a scene to conclude. All of these non conventional actions by director, Barry Levenson,were for purposes of manufacturing a tertiary spontaneity from the actors in the movie. Such an auspicious lack of inhibition sparked a natural emotional realism that made the film Diner truly unique! Many scenes brought on a free spirited innocence that prevailed back in Baltimore in 1959 (The city and the year that this film was suppose to take place). The Popcorn Scene with Mickey Rourke was hysterically funny, as it is indicative of the sordid wiles men will engage in to get the attention of a beautiful woman, especially if it for purposes of impressing his close knit buddies!! The Piano Scene was one of the best scenes in any movie I have seen whatsoever!! Tim Daly's piano playing was a mandatory form of entertainment to break up the sedentary monotony of an ossified nightclub! The type of character Steve Guttenberg played was one which was very identifiable to me. I saw myself in Steve Guttenburg's character so many times in the movie, but, particularly in the Piano Scene. I could envision myself dancing recklessly in dare devil fashion while wearing Shetland wool! This was so Steve Guttenberg's character, and, it was so much like something I might do as well!! This film focused on the bittersweet scenario, pertaining to the peculiar viewpoint by some barely adult men, who had a penchant for believing that an individual's sense of humor should be his single most coveted attribute in the world. Such a mindset purveys the ground-rules of survival being a case of how a human being's sense of humor should be endless, because his egregious flaws as an individual are endless as well!! Diner accentuated the necessary dichotomy between social cohesiveness and individuality! Ultimately, the film would bridge the gap with precocious candor. This itemization of quirky concepts accomplished a successfully ambiguous cultural dissemination of adolescent ideas with all the main characters of this movie. The incongruity contained in the conversations with everybody became a capriciously acute element to this film which successfully evoked a superbly unprecedented directorial finesse!! Diner did not win the academy award for best movie in 1982. When a movie wins an Oscar for best picture during any given year, it is usually a very good film. When a film manifests a fondness for individual expression by establishing a reality on how people truly are by what they find amusing, with that, emanates the real definition of a comedy. If a movie can accomplish such a feat, then this is an undeniably great film. Without question, the film Diner' is a movie that may be put into this category!! A bevy of talented people partook in this movie. This box office bonanza of stars comprises of; Mickey Rourke, Steve Guttenberg, Tim Daly, Ellen Barkin, Daniel Stern, Kevin Bacon, and Paul Reiser. (Reiser's curiosity with the term, nuance, in this movie, later surfaced itself to reality by way of a production company which was entitled Nuance Productions that Paul Reiser was part owner of). Given the fact that so many actors, actresses, directors and producers have 30,000 square foot domiciles in Beverly Hills and on Park Avenue, it becomes rather obvious that money is not always a top priority with them. Ultimately, they realize that the purpose for making a movie is to raise the bar on entertainment standards. This encapsulation concerning man's sanguine flippancy about perpetual failure, which this film, Diner illustrated, was totally astounding! More specifically put, an integral facet of movie entertainment is predicated on accurately pinpointing what human nature is truly like. Often times, I have thought that if you only want to see two movies in your entire life, those two films should be Glengarry Glen Ross and Diner. Both movies capture a grass roots recognition of what people's attitudes and instinctive reactions really are. I would give the nod to Diner over Glengarry Glen Ross because Diner illustrates a realism which is portrayed with a far more positive disposition! Such a reality gives Diner an enthusiastic identifiability. Attaining a stranglehold on the positive elements of human intuition in a movie like Diner is a goal that is so crucial to a film! So much so, that if a director does this, but, he does not win an Oscar for his film, his response should be SO WHAT!! The movie Diner is a one of a kind gem! Diner has achieved the ultimate accolade of being a movie which ignites a humanistic gratification to a near perfect state! This film has artistically conquered an elementary objective for making a movie! Such an accomplishment is what film making is all about, to which, I have only one thing to say, An Oscar!!

Its a more substantial and intelligent coming of age tale than that pop culture favorite. Despite being a huge critical hit when originally released, Diner seems to become more and more underrated with each passing year. Thats a shame, because its really a terrifically entertaining and well written film. Sure, there's not much of a plot to be had ultimately, but with characters and dialog this fantastic, thats more than acceptable. The film details a group of college buddies moving onto adulthood during the Christmas season in 1959 in Baltimore. It shows that, despite their aging, many of the characters still have a good amount of emotional maturing to do.Its odd to see so many big stars in this film and realize they were all relatively unknown. Its no big surprise that they all became major Hollywood plays subsequently on the strength of this film, with many of them continuing to be big stars up to this day (Kevin Bacon, Ellen Barkin) and others unfortunately having their career dwindle (Steve Guttenberg and Mickey Rourke until his recent comeback). All of the actors give possibly their best performances in this film. The dialog about seemingly nothing was a big influence on many 90s productions as well, from Tarantino's films to Seinfeld. Barry Levinson's direction is very good as well, keeping this at a quick pace. The only minor flaw is Mickey Rourke. Rourke is a great actor and does a good job here, but I disliked his sleazy character, and didn't find him sympathetic like the rest of the protagonists. Still, this is a truly great film. Anyone interested in getting into screen writing really needs to see this.

Be sure and listen to the dialog spoken over the ending credits. It cleverly encapsulates the entire film. The movie is noteworthy for making stars of six new faces to the cinema public, Steven Guttenberg, Daniel Stern, Mickey Rourke, Kevin Bacon, Timothy Daly, and Ellen Barkin. Had it been created before American Graffiti, it would have been the definitive coming of age flick. Coming nine years later, it pales in the shadow of that seminal work. Still, Diner is a worthwhile piece of cinema and is much more cerebral than American Graffiti. There are a few time-line problems. I too was finishing high school and preparing for college during the same time interval. Only I was located in rural America and the protagonists of Diner lived in an urban setting. Radio was AM and dominated by the top forty play list. Seldom were older rock 'n' roll songs played. Naturally there were no oldies stations yet. Teens basked in the audio heaven of the popular tunes of the day. The Diner soundtrack appropriately contains such hits of 1959-60 as Beyond the Sea, Theme From a Summer Place, and Goodbye Baby, but also contains songs that were rarely if ever played on AM radio or on diner juke boxes in 1959-60, such as It's All In The Game, Don't Be Cruel, and Fascination. This all makes for one of the best 50's soundtracks ever, but distracts from the credibility of the film setting.Teens of the period throughout American had a favorite gathering place or rendezvous. For me it was a local diner called The Hickory House. Sitting in cars, drinking, and shooting the BS was as popular as actually going inside the diner, though that took place too. Diner accurately portrays this aspect of teenage gregariousness. The courting rituals and dating challenges are also true to life for the period. A mediocre film, A Summer Place was extremely popular with teens of the period, in particular girls, since it was basically a chick flick. By using it as a backdrop to the story, Levinson enhances the scene with the popcorn box and makes it much more meaningful, especially to those who have watched A Summer Place. Another aspect of reality used by Levinson in a telling way is the concept of male, female relationships at the time. For example, when Timothy Fenwick (Bacon) starts using vulgar language during the car wreck tomfoolery, the other guys point to Beth (Barkin) and indicate by gesture that there is a lady present. Today, female teens readily use vulgar talk as often as males. Changing times.Diner is one of the best of the teen angst films shot during the 70's and 80's and not to be missed. If the viewer lived through the time passage in the movie, it is all that more enjoyable to see.

A bunch of college-aged guys in late 1950's Baltimore gather over the Christmas holidays and eat french fries with gravy at their favorite local diner and talk about stuff . . . oh yeah, they also confront the painful necessity of making the transition from carefree adolescence to the responsibilities of adulthood.The reason for the gathering Eddie (Steve Guttenberg) is getting married. TV salesman Shrevie (Daniel Stern) is already married and prefers to cling to his single friends lifestyle instead of trying to understand his wife, Beth (Ellen Barkin). Fenwick (Kevin Bacon) is the smart and cynical black sheep son of a rich family, who seems to have a drinking problem. Boogie (Mickey Rourke) is a hairstylist/law student and a smooth-talking ladies man, but his mounting gambling debts are getting him into trouble. Billy (Timothy Daley) has escaped to college and gotten involved in a messy romance with a longtime platonic girlfriend. Then there's Modell (Paul Reiser), the soft-spoken philosopher/comedian of the group, who ponders the meaning of the word nuance and, in the film's funniest scene, torments Eddie over a roast beef sandwich. Eddie himself is a lazy, immature-yet-amiable lout who is making his bride-to-be pass a football quiz before tying the knot. The interaction between these friends sets in motion a story that is as deep as the meaning of life, and as shallow as the question of who's the better singer - Sinatra or Mathis? Diner is simply one of the best movies ever made about male-bonding. Working from a highly autobiographical script, director Barry Levinson has created a masterful comedy and an insightful character study. What he does so well is capture the way guys act when women aren't around - they smoke and drink and stay up all night and laugh and talk about cars and music and sports, and of course they rack their brains trying to figure out the opposite sex. Any woman wanting to understand the male psyche would do well to study this film.More importantly he also perfectly captures the feeling of inevitable change hanging over these characters. There's this wistful desire to hang on to past relationships, to revel in familiar people and places before moving forward, before dealing with the anxiety of the approaching unknown. It's this quality that makes Diner such a special film. It can be enjoyed on a surface level for it's humor and nostalgia, or you can dig deeper and appreciate the profound observations it makes on the human condition. Either way it is an amazing film.

The previous two were more about partying and the nostalgia factor, while this one is much more serious. The focus is on the relationship between this group of men in 1959 Baltimore, and the paths that their lives are taking. Each of them has his flaws, but is well-meaning. In fact, they all seem like losers, but they're all supportive of each other.This was definitely a splendid directorial debut for Levinson. It's the perfect blend of drama with only the slightest hint of nostalgia. Like the other two movies, it has a great soundtrack, but that never distracts from the plot. If anything, it's there to remind us that these men are about to enter a new world, both with their transition to adulthood and with the coming of the '60s.All in all, a very fine effort. Steve Guttenberg, Daniel Stern, Mickey Rourke, Kevin Bacon, Tim Daly, Ellen Barkin and Paul Reiser have every reason to be proud of this.

Diner focuses itself on several college-aged boys in 1959 Baltimore, caught in that awkward stage right on the cusp of manhood. Each prominent member of the group is stuck at a crossroads between life as a carefree teenager and having to move into the adult world; Eddie Simmons (Steve Guttenberg) is days away from his wedding, Shrevie Schreiber (Daniel Stern) is in a young marriage to Beth (Ellen Barkin), Boogie Sheftell (Mickey Rourke) is a playboy working at a beauty shop, Timothy Fenwick (Kevin Bacon) is a developing alcoholic living off his trust fund, and Billy Howard (Tim Daly) has just come home for Eddie's wedding.Levinson takes on a slightly non-traditional structure here, as the film occurs almost in a series of vignettes as opposed to a typical narrative. He made the wise move to get the actors acquainted with one another before shooting began, so when it came time to start rolling on the film he was able to build conversations through improvisation and the actors own relationships, as opposed to forcing them to read strict lines off the page. It has a free flow to it all, wisely directed by Levinson and marvelously acted by the young cast of fresh actors. You can feel that camaraderie in their chemistry together, you can really feel all of those years of building relationships between them.Some of the actors do shine individually; Rourke in particular steals the show, coming onto the screen as if he were a born star. He has the kind of natural charisma and compelling presence that the young Paul Newman and James Dean had, drawing your eyes towards him instantly whenever he comes on screen. There's a soft, sincere man inside that casually flamboyant shell, the kind of guy who wants you to think he's something that he really isn't, and Rourke plays it with such wonderful nuance. It's an impressive performance on it's own, but the real treat of the film is seeing the whole ensemble of young stars working together.Diner is a story of boys who have to finally make the decision to become men and I think this is an interesting part on the development of men. Over the years there have been hundreds and hundreds of films about adolescence, about boys half the age of the ones seen here, but not enough about this stage in life, one that I find infinitely more interesting. I think any man who is in this stage of their life, or has already passed it, can find a lot to relate to in these characters and the fact that I'm currently in a similar stage surely helped me admire the film even more. It takes place in 1959 but the themes of maturity and morality speak to any generation. They're all caught right in this area between boy and man and it makes for several interesting contradictions within the characters.Bacon's Fenwick is developing a severe alcohol problem and spends most of his time clowning around and pissing away his life, but we can see that he is an extremely intelligent guy who is wasting his potential. Rourke's Boogie is two thousand dollars in debt from gambling, but he still finds time to get a girl to touch his erection through a popcorn box. Guttenberg's Eddie is getting married in a week but instead of finding the courage to be a responsible man he puts all of his insecurities about taking the plunge into whether or not his fiancée can pass a silly test about football. These guys are all right on that edge and the film centers around them having to own up to where they are in their life and realize that it's time to stop being boys goofing around at the local diner and move onto becoming men.A lot of films that work with this kind of theme tend to force too much development into such a short time period, to the point where it becomes clear fiction. Levinson wisely avoids this, developing ideas that we don't see the full result of. The alcoholism of Bacon's character is an issue that comes into play for certain, but as the film closes it's still one that exists. It's still one that will impact him for years to come and we don't see the final completion of it. There's a scene early on where Shrevie and Beth go to get in their car and she stands there, waiting for him to open the door, but he doesn't do it. It's a small moment that keys into the discourse of their marriage, a discourse that is developed within the context of the film, but you know when it's over that they still have a long way to go.Levinson doesn't concern himself with trying to work these characters through their entire life in a two hour period. Instead, he foreshadows events that will come to pass later in life, realizing that this is just a small moment in the grand scheme of it all. It's a shockingly realistic and non-exaggerated approach that I found very impressively done on his part. The film opens up on Christmas of '59 and closes on New Year's Eve the same year, an appropriate time for where these men are in their life. As one decade ends, another begins and they have to evolve themselves just as the year is evolving into a new decade. It's another relatively subtle touch on Levinson's part, but it adds another nice metaphor to where these guys are at and where they are headed to.

They ought to be defended and preserved, not to mention valued and treasured. This naturalistically acted movie isn't extravagant or lengthy, but it's the kind of minor, truthful, enjoyable movie that should never go out of fashion, even now that the tradition of sequels and blockbusters has been thoroughly established. It's not quite seamless, yet its intermittent patchiness is part of its allure. There's an exhilaration in watching a gifted hatchling filmmaker skate on thin ice.This wistful, charismatic sleeper sounds initially like a genre movie in the always trendy Stand by Me While I Look Dazed and Confused at American Pie and/or Graffiti at Ridgemont High pattern. Like American Graffiti, or like Porky's, etc., it's set in a youth-driven bygone era marked by perpetual nostalgia, routinely revisits some favorite place and highlights young men moving toward maturity while talking relentlessly about sex, to the jingle of a ceaseless line of hit records.Yet the similitude stops there. One of the most sensitive youth accounts about the vacuum between genders, it's a lot less blithe than any of its foils. The ambiance is reverberated by the set design, which is actually rather gritty and dingy. In just one crucial scene do two characters find themselves beyond Baltimore's worn boundaries, and amidst a vast, sunlit countryside in a well-heeled hamlet. Riding horseback past them is an advantaged, beautiful girl. You ever get the feeling that there's something going on that we don't know about? one character asks the other, and then they zip right back to the movie's dim daily backdrop.Barry Levinson, the film's writer and director, almost treads more Mean Streets-style water with such strokes, and those are actually the few scenes that seem to slightly miscarry, forthright as they are. But Levinson's sentiment for and interest in his young-at-heart characters are distinctive. And his immoderation, like theirs, is effortlessly absolved.His tribute to the fine art of screen writing is about a cluster of high-school buddies who, in 1959, are a year or two graduated, and now starting to belatedly come into their own. Shrevie has already tumbled into an early marriage with a woman with whom, he entrusts to a chum, he cannot have a meaningful exchange. Sex is no longer a god to him, but he's already melancholy for the time when it was. His wife Beth, rendered very movingly in only a few scenes in Ellen Barkin's first big-screen role, knows him so little that she cannot even fathom something as essential and imperative as how he keeps his records categorized. At the end of a lingering marital clash in which he has berated Beth about the LPs, Shrevie, intending to express his recollection for details, roars at Beth that Ain't That a Shame was playing when he first met her in 1955.Another of the boys, Eddie, is about to wed a girl whom we incessantly hear about though never see. Eddie's such a Baltimore Colts devotee that he's asserting that their colors be the theme for the wedding. He's such an anxious bridegroom that he's requiring Elyse score higher than 65 on a sports quiz of Eddie's own design. If Elyse fails, he declares, wedding's off. He's for real. What'll he do when she scores 63? The other leads are self-indulgent, ill-mannered trust-fund rebel Fenwick, who, in one remarkable private scene shows an uncannily encyclopedic intellect; persuasive charmer Boogie, who gambles on everything, counting his sex life and who works as a beautician though scores better with chicks if he tells them he's studying law, and Timothy Daly's smartly played polite, square-shooting collegian Billy, who can't convince his pregnant girlfriend to marry him. These characters are well drawn on their own individual merits, and they're played stunningly. Levinson unearthed a top-quality cast, most of them no-names but few for long.Guttenberg and Stern had previous film experience, though neither played such rich characters as Shrevie and Eddie before. Kevin Bacon, who thus far had any been teen #2 and annoying jock #1 in a handful of slasher flicks and frathouse rom-coms, makes Fenwick a remarkable fusion of indulgence and despair. Rourke gives one of the best of his many memorable performances. Low-key and crafty, his shiftless Boogie also ends up being arguably the most good-natured character, and Rourke makes his gentleness feel engaging and genuine.Levinson fluctuates the movie's temper greatly from scene to scene. Some sequences, like one at a strip club, where two of the boys get the band to play lively jazz and everyone begins bopping, are wholesome whimsy, and don't quite feel like anything else. Others, as when the group sits quarrelling over who's better between Sinatra or Mathis, have a gracefully authentic ordinariness. So does a scene in which Shrevie, who works in a TV shop, attempts to sway one patron to buy a color set, although the man claims he once saw Bonanza in color and the Ponderosa looked faked. Levinson isn't above sending his characters to see Troy Donahue and Sandra Dee at a local movie house, either. The melancholy characteristic of his material is engaged to its maximum degree.However Diner has a lot more to it than that, and it doesn't seem to aspire to the calculated dependability that other, likewise constructed movies are after. Levinson isn't simply a fuddy-dud with an affectionate or comprehensive reminiscence for his own youth. He's someone trying to grasp that era, not just to evoke it. Indeed, Diner is ultimately a film we can all understand on a universal level.

Six young American guys bond with each other for security as they move out of adolescence and into adulthood. Given that the story takes place in 1959, the transition applies equally to American culture, which transitions out of the dull 50s and into the chaotic 60s. These guys will never be young again, and neither will America; hence, the appeal to nostalgia.An ensemble cast allows for the film to be a series of vignettes involving one or more of the characters. As such, the plot seems jerky, almost random at times. Characters seem shallow, egocentric, and predictably preoccupied with romance and sex. I couldn't get interested in any of them. The story is set in dreary Baltimore at Christmas. So the overall plot has the feel of a very specific place and time.The script is very talky. Not much happens. Characters stand around, drive around, meet at the diner for burgers ... and talk. Some of the banter is clever; most is just tedious. I thought the casting was a bit weak, in that the differentiation among the six guys is not as pronounced as that of American Graffiti (1973). Acting is average. Some of the chitchat is improvisational.I was disappointed with the background music. Again, it is somewhat weak. There are a few good 1950s songs, the ones by Bobby Darin and Fats Domino. But most of the selections are not especially nostalgic. On the other hand, the color visuals do create the look of that era quite well.It's almost as if this film borrowed its underlying concept from American Graffiti, which I like considerably better, partly because of its more archetypal characters. Then too, the two films address a slightly different American constituency. Diner is set on the East Coast, American Graffiti on the West Coast. Maybe I just identify more with the West.

They spend most of their time at a local greasy-spoon diner discussing their collective fears of growing up. Inspite of one being married, the group seems ambition-less with little respect for women. It seems their goals are 'copping a feel' and 'getting laid'.These somewhat shallow characters are played by a host of future accomplished stars. Mickey Rourke plays a hairdresser by day and a law student by night. He is driven by sex and his gambling habit. Kevin Bacon's character is estranged from his wealthy family and has a warped, if not sick, sense of humor. Steve Guttenberg is approaching marriage, only if his fiancée can pass a quiz of football trivia. Daniel Stern is cast as the married friend, who is having troubles with his wife(Ellen Barkin). Paul Reiser is the complainer of the group. Tim Daly plays a grad student with his own problematic love life. I really enjoyed the interaction of these young men, as they whittle away their time holding court in their favorite diner. Bumbling, arrogant, stupid and obnoxious actions of this circle of friends is played quite believably.The atmosphere is sustained by a wonderful soundtrack of the times featuring the likes of Chuck Berry, Eddie Cochran, Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, Dion & The Belmonts, Howling Wolf, Bobby Darin and of course, Elvis.Also in the cast Kathryn Dowling, Colette Blonigan, John Aquino and Michael Tucker.

Although the movie lacks a conventional plot, it still tells a story about people who play off each other with dramatic results.

All they do is talk, laugh, and complain, and it does not take much to split the group apart.

Now, the cast is universally excellent with Mickey Rourke delivering the strongest performance.

Basically the film is set in Baltimore, 1959, where a group of twenty-something male high school students reunite for the wedding of one of them. The group's regular hangout and meeting spot is in the Fells Point Diner, and they are challenging their relationships as they head for adulthood. Edward 'Eddie' Simmons (Steve Guttenberg) is the one getting married, Laurence 'Shrevie' Schreiber (Daniel Stern) questions why he is married to Beth (Ellen Barkin), Robert 'Boogie' Sheftell (Mickey Rourke) is a gambler with many debts, Timothy Fenwick Jr. (Kevin Bacon) is an irresponsible drunk with attitude problems, and William 'Billy' Howard (Tim Daly, as Timothy) is in love with a woman who is pregnant but doesn't want to marry him. There is no real plot as such, it is just taking a look at each of the five group members one at a time as they struggle with whatever problems they face as they grow up. Also starring Paul Reiser as Modell, Kathryn Dowling as Barbara, Michael Tucker as Bagel and Jessica James as Mrs. Simmons. It was nominated the Academy Award for scripting, but actually the actors were mostly ad-libbing which makes it look all the more naturalistic. My favourite scene is Stern getting moody when his wife doesn't order his record collection properly, I can be like that sometimes with my DVD collection. I think the big reason to see this film is to see where big stars like Guttenberg, Rourke and Stern really had their careers kick off in the way they did, it is a good old fashioned comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Levinson, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical.

The fact that so many of them went on to bigger & better things really says something about the casting. As for performances, I wouldn't single out anyone above the others; the cast is best considered as an ensemble.Structurally, the story's somewhat rambling and episodic though there are at least a few distinct plot threads. The film's looseness allows us to get to know the film's characters through observing them. Ultimately, though, while the story may seem a bit aimless at times it does indeed come together in the end.Levinson's direction is well-handled and he does a good job of bringing his own script to life. His actors really interact like they've been friends for years. The soundtrack also deserves special mention since it features an appealing and diverse mix of period-specific music.All in all, Diner is a well executed comedic drama, albeit one with more of an emphasis on character than on plot.

From the guy spouting off the dialogue from Sweet Smell of Success to Earl who eats everything from the entire left side of menu to Bagel who's looking out for Boogie to Eddie's Mom who threatens to kill Eddie with a cooking knife in one of the films funniest moment to the thick accented owner of the Fells Point Diner; you can see that the glue that holds the main characters together is everyone and everything from their Baltimore neighborhood.This movie has great dialogue (its certainly more quote-worthy than Sweet Smell of Successs) and it emulates a lot of what men do at this point in life --- obsessing about sports, music, and girls and defending your immaturity as its a smile "},{"Title":"Some of the best dialogue ever","Date":"18 May 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Some of the best dialogue in any movie (If I didn't know better I would have guessed Tarantino had a hand in this).

Going through with a marriage based on the fact whether or not the bride-to-be passes a test about football is as ridiculous as can be. Coming of age or not, mature couples don't do things like this and marriage is a serious institution. With attitudes like this, is it any wonder that the divorce rate is constantly increasing?I saw a complete lack of maturity of those who are supposedly law students.A foolish, inane movie.

Diner, by far is a classic film with an emphasis on great dialog--seemingly natural and realistic. Even the slang was vintage 50's. I had visited a friend (Andrew Neal Gorelick) in Baltimore not long after the movie had come out and he showed me all the Baltimore highlights that were inspirational to the film. The character Boogie was based on a real life guy named Boogie Weinglass who, legend has it, was a great B.S.er and actually opened a successful chain of clothing stores called Merry Go Round. He eventually sold out and I couldn't find out anything more about him and what followed. I'm sure Barry Levinson might know. I love Baltimore even though I'm from NY!!

Quentin Tarantino, needless to say, won with ease (this i do not question as an avid fan of Tarantino's pre-Kill Bill dialogue) but one name was missing from the list; Barry Levinson. Whether Levinson's entire back catalogue warrants a nomination is questionable, but based on the witty, and often improvised dialogue of Diner- that brings realism and a sense of kinship amongst the young friends- it would appear he deserves a mention. Notable scenes include, the familiar banter over a beef sandwich in the diner, Modell's musings on the word 'nuance', the lovable camaraderie the guys share during a bet over Boogie's chances on his date, and the harsh truths a dancer reveals to Billy about his relationship. Of course Diner has more to offer than just dialogue, it is a sincere look at the years of confusion between youth and adulthood through the eyes of a group of flawed, but identifiable characters. Kevin Bacon plays the underachieving Fenwick with casual ease, turning someone who could be construed as simply arrogant into an ever-endearing loser. Beth and Shrevie's relationship documents very honestly the doubts surrounding many young marriages, while Micky Rourke is unrecognisable as a charming, James Dean style rogue. The reason Diner really succeeds where the Mtv infected Brat Pack movies often failed is the love Levinson displays for his characters, and the genuine friendship they appear to share on screen, rather then opting for rushed characters each filling a key niche market on screen, played by the latest beautiful young actor, in order to cash in on teen angst. However, this film would not earn the ten given here without the effortless, ad libbed dialogue done 20 years before Judd Apatow. Ps, keep watching the credits until the end to witness the zenith of Levinson's and the young actors comedy dialogue skills.

Rourke is the Casanova of the gang but he's also immersed in fear of not seeing the next day, with the impending pressure of having to pay off some gambling debts to a local mob. Still he might be physically near to crying but he tries his utmost not to let down his cocky façade in front of his friends. Really, I can perfectly see why people would see him as a promising actor at his point in time. The soundtrack is OK and some of the banter inside the title's diner does show some chemistry.And now the bad I know this is from 82 and meant to mirror the 50's but boy is this film misogynistic. Their objectifying chats are one thing but that football test in order to get married just seems to come out of the stone age, when that girl's mom calls on the phone to check out how her daughter's doing on the test as if it's perfectly normal I kinda zoned out from it. Kevin Bacon's character is supposed to be somewhat crazy but we have no idea why. Is he schizophrenic? Is he depressed and trying to get some attention? We have no idea and his craziness seems to be there only for the sake of some wacky moments. Daniel Stern plays a music geek, high on trivia and low on communicating with his wife. As a music brainiac myself I felt disgusted by the way he carries himself and by the whiny, childish tantrum he gets when a record is not in place, literally driving his wife t tears. Geez, I know it's supposed to vent his frustration about not having anything to talk about with his spouse but no one would be that insensitive (telling her not to order the records herself-maybe, making her cry-don't think so). It's the most denigrating music fan image I've ever seen on film.In the end we're left with a handful of amusing moments marred by lack of character development (which is odd considering this is exactly the right kind of movie for that)and a dated feel to it all in more ways than one.

One of them is about to get married, while the others talk about different stuff that they don't care about, or just as obnoxious as the person who says it.

Debating, trading food, comparing, and other whatnot's. The one scene that got me the most is when Boogie(Rourke) unzipped his fly, and put the popcorn box in his pants while watching A Summer Place. He freaked her out when his member peeked from the popcorn. He explained his situation, and she's cool about it. Other women would run for their lives. Then there was the late night jam when two of the friends decided to kick up the joint, and everyone have a great time. We all need to grow up, but who says who has to stay that way.

It's funny, poignant and has a spectacular cast.I can't get enough of Paul Reiser's character, Modell. Good Golly he's funny.Discussing the concept of evolution, Reiser speaks one of my favorite lines, The guy who makes up this stuff it's the stupidest thing I've ever heard - people do not come from swamps. They come from Europe.This line comes from potentially the best post-movie credit sequence I've ever seen (or rather, heard).

They're all such close friends, Reiser manages to never actually ask for the lift, he always gets The Gute to offer.A young Mickey Rourke is almost unrecognizable in this film. And he delivers a spectacular performance.Daniel Stern's character is also great, now that I think about it. You know him from Home Alone. His character is such a well-meaning fella.

He is like a tightly wound spring, but worth much more than first appears.The minor character who memorizes the lines from Sweet Smell of Success, cracks me up every time he interrupts a conversation.I'm not sure if women will enjoy this film as much as men. The themes seem very masculine; they reflect the subtleties of my interactions with my male friends. I'd be interested to hear if women feel like they really connect with certain aspects of the movie.One might say Diner is misogynistic.I say, Feh!One could argue that the pacing is slow at the beginning, but personally, I won't do so.The only criticism I can muster is about the moment of most tension, the pinnacle of the film's conflict.

Directed by Barry Levinson, Diner is an episodic look at childhood buddies, now twenty somethings in 1959 Baltimore who gather at the Fells Point Diner as they deal with the problems and opportunities of adulthood. Eddie (Guttenberg) is engaged to be married, but if his girlfriend Elyse can't pass a Colts quiz, the wedding's off. One of the guys, Shrevie (Stern)is already married to Beth (Barkin), but doesn't seem particularly happy. A music fanatic, he harangues at her for messing up his records. Beth, meanwhile, misses the good old days of attention from men and, unhappy, she thinks about having an affair.Boogie (Rourke) is a hairdresser attending law school who plays the field, gambles, and is often in trouble because he can't pay his debts to the kind of people you don't disappoint. Billy (Daly) has been getting his MBA in college and returns to Baltimore to see his girlfriend Barb. Fen (Bacon) resents his family but lives off of his trust fund. Modell (Reiser) is generally insecure. Funny, poignant, well acted, with a great sound track, Diner takes us through women problems, marital problems, virginity, pregnancy, money problems, family problems, sports, music, and the film Sweet Smell of Success, and their childish bets.For them, the Diner is a refuge, a place to be a kid again, all the while knowing that soon enough, they're all going to have to become responsible adults whether they like it or not. Life demands it.All the actors give special performances with their characters well fleshed out Rourke, with his soft voice and handsome face (why would anyone so adorable do what he did to his face?) belying all the difficulty he makes for himself; Daly as an uptight young man who wants to do the right thing; Reiser, with his easy line delivery; Bacon, the obnoxious rich kid; Guttenberg, the sports fanatic; Stern, the music nut. Michael Tucker is Bagel, another diner customer, who helps Boogie out of a real mess.A poignant ending, with a delightful bit of standup by Reiser, serves as a reminder that you can't stay a kid forever. But they'll always have the diner.

There are good swatches at real immature, closeted, misogynistic traits but the timing is awkward and much of it is played out long after it makes the point.The record sorting scene is done with more restraint and has more impact and is more memorable because it plays more like a 45 and not an LP. The flip side is that when this memory lane movie is good it is very good. But it is a mixed bag, just like the albums of its day. One Hit with a lot of filler.The pacing is smooth but intentional placing of the songs sometimes seems out of place, put the film does put you in a time and place that is fondly remembered as the end of the age of innocence.

Eddie (Steve Guttenberg) is on the verge of getting hitched, laden with certain doubts about his choice. Shrevie (Daniel Stern), the only married man among the bunch, is a musical geek happily wed to Beth (Ellen Barkin). Boogie (Mickey Rourke) represents the opposite, a free spirit with a weakness for gambling and women, studying law only to impress the ladies. Similarly Timothy Fenwick Jr. (Kevin Bacon) lives recklessly and aimlessly - despite belonging to a wealthy and influential family he spends his time disconnected from them and slacking it off in his Porsche. Billy (Tim Daly) seems to be the groups father figure, rational and always controlled. That is until he platonic friend declares she is pregnant with his child after a single night of madness. The sixth of the pack is Modell (Paul Reiser), whose seemingly only role is to make up the numbers.Through this loquacious picture haplessly concentrating key events around a diner slash meeting place of choice for six best friends we venture into the feeling of a time and place, one so internally American than it fails to strike a cord with overseas audience. Mischievous and at times subversively funny the end result is however tailor-made for local audiences, who can fully appreciate the backyard amiability of the witty gang. Not to say this is a bad thing - some things aren't meant to have global appeal and within its target it is undoubtedly an intriguing gem, one still influential for buddy or verbose flicks and also a point of reference for such movies as Before Sunrise or Smoke.Talkative and largely improvised features tirades by great actors, whose magnetic presence captivates, especially when talking about Bacon or Rourke.

What is most interesting, however, is how the movie prefigures so much of what passes now for originality in cinema.  Consider the sandwich argument and then think of Jerry, George, and Kramer sitting in their own diner.  This movie is a kind of primer on contemporary friendship stories featuring ensemble casts.  Think Beautiful Girls, Friends, The Big Chill, Kicking and Screaming, Metropolitan,  to name just a few of the successes.  In fact, I think it's possible that it's impact might be dating the film somewhat let's face it, the diner dialogue schtick has been copied so many times now (with hugely mixed results) that I think newcomers to Levinson's original may not be as impressed/surprised.  Hopefully, this isn't the case, as there are still some special moments here.One other thought I had was that this may also be a fundamentally guy movie.  It seems to focus very specifically on how young men often relate to each other and to problems associated with a particular time in life call it the rat pack mentality.  I'm not sure how many women will identify as readily with these relationships.PS The DVD has a neat making of documentary which gives some nice insight into how Levinson fostered a real sense of camraderie between his young actors, which definitely shows onscreen.

Barry Levinson, through the use of conversation of five young men in a Baltimore diner, has made a warm, humming snapshot of an America that is optimistic and full of expectation. Each of the friends is affected differently by the change over from east coast to west coast sensibilities. Mickey Rourke is especially touching as the rough-around-the-edges guy -- a hairdresser who gets in trouble with his bookie and who tells girls he's in law school to get dates. His character makes a real leap into decency and manhood when he gives up a sexual encounter with one of the friend's wives to win a bet. I have never seen him in anything to top this performance. He is right on and reminds me of the guys I knew here in the West Side of Chicago in the 50's. The ensemble acting zings, and each time I see one of the actors in another movie - I think of this movie -- a testament to the cast and writer-director. Levinson's best stuff. Everything works.

Big-budget blockbuster movies have robbed many viewers of a capacity to appreciate simple storylines - indeed if anything, Diner could well claim to be anti-storyline.It deconstructs the notion that a storyline should build slowly then peak at the end. With Diner, we feel we've entered the story somewhere in the middle, and leave somewhere before the end. I personally found the slow pacing of the film refreshing, especially as 'slow paced' is usually a negative term. Here, it serves to highlight the realism inherent in the structure of the film. As an ensemble movie, the cast is exceptional. If some characters aren't fleshed out to the point where they become incredibly interesting, just stop and think how many friends do you have who seem two-dimensional and seems to blend into other friends? Groups (especially of men) tend to melt into each other when chatting, they adopt each others mannerisms and turn of phrase. Of the cast, I would certainly agree that it's a shame how most of them turned out later in their careers. Steve Guttenberg is excellent in this - he even managed to bury my nightmares about Police Academy - and one wonders why he didn't stick to roles that demanded a mixture of comedy and pathos which he does so well in this film. Saddest of all though is Mickey Rourke. For me, he stands out a mile in this film and is genuinely brilliant. I think it's probably fitting that he went off on a different course (boxing etc) because he still remains an enigma today; and one of the few actors I've seen who really do light up the screen. Mickey, we salute you.

The casting, writing and direction of this movie reveal the genius of its director, Barry Levinson, who is most definitely a Balitmorean and not a Baltimoron.  There is constantly something happening in this movie, even if it is all a great deal of talk and eating and smoking.  The best parts are probably the football quiz, Fenwick in the manger, grabbing for popcorn at the movies, the strip club piano player, and Tim Daly's line in jail, I'll hit you so hard, I'll kill your whole family.Diner is the first and best part of Levinson's Baltimore trilogy, see also Tin Men and Avalon.  Avalon by the way deserved much more kudos than it received; Tin Men a little less up to the level of the other two.I have been raving about this movie for about 20 years to friends, lovers and close associates, and it is nice to have a forum on the Internet to sing its praises.

The man is an outstanding director, but this movie shouts, first time effort. Perhaps one would have to be born in this era (1959) to get it, because I sure didn't. It's not an awful movie, it's just a textbook case of mediocrity. Let me elaborate.The year is 1959. We have a group of friends in their early twenties who have been hanging out at a local diner for years. One is married, Daniel Stern to Ellen Barkin, and one is about to get married, Steve Guttenburg. One has gotten a girl pregnant and wants to marry her, Tim Daly. One is just a little crazy for no apparent reason, Kevin Bacon. One is literally just there. And lastly is the good looking, suave, gambling prone Mickey Rourke.Basically that's it. You may ask, Ok, where is the movie review? But that is it. There really is no review. Nothing happens with these guys. There is no character development. No real protagonist or antagonist. There is only a series of events that seem to have no consequences except that, in the end, they all just wind up back at the diner.I just didn't feel anything for any of these characters. There was nothing to this movie. I just sat there waiting for it to get good. Instead, I felt like I was stuck in the doldrums.The last two minutes of the movie pretty much sum up the general feel of the 110 minute film in full. Paul Reiser is telling a joke, in voice over, while the credits roll. The whole time, he is stumbling through it and forgetting parts of the joke. When he gets to where we are supposed to hear the punchline, he just stops telling his joke and the rest of the guys talk about how cool the diner used to be and how cool they are now, hanging out at the same diner. That's it. There is just nothing there. It isn't funny, it isn't moving, it isn't anything. This movie reminded me of the film, The Big Chill.

Curiously, most of the impact of the movie, for me, had very little to do with the diner. You can take a diner in an obvious movie like When Harry Met... and the diner is memorable. The beauty, almost, of this movie is that the diner anchors the movie, but a lot lot of the play, or important play, is outside of the diner. I found that fascinating.

Thanks for being there for me, buddy.  Of them all Guttenberg was my least favorite.  I mean, quizzing your fiance on football and if she doesn't pass, you don't marry her?  Get outta here.

They're looking for a woman who is like one of their buddies, and be it 1959 (the film's setting) or 2002, 95% of men will NEVER find that.  Just ask all the divorcees.  But that's off topic.  Bascially this is a bunch of buddies sharing stories and going through little problems.  The script needed more punch, though.  The occassional familiar oldie helped it along at times, but I'd prefer more story.  And despite the others going on to bigger and better theaterically, the film's main star is Daly, and the only real mature one.

Plus, there's something in the way that it's put together that just sparkles. It just seems to have all the right elements, in the right combination.I can't believe people refer to this as a guy flick. I'm female, and to me, it just seemed universal in theme. What we did see of gender relations was out-of-synch and tragic. It almost seemed like there was a sad commentary there. I think that's one of the reasons I like the film so much, other than the camaraderie and the humor - that both Beth and Barbara's characters seem so desperately to want to be human and they both end up, in some way, just being treated as girls. The football scene is hilarious, but there's a kind of brutal coldness there as well.Diner is a very funny movie with a soft sad undertone, just another one of the many reasons it works so well.

Steve Guttenberg, Daniel Stern and such can do this because theyve shared memories and learned more about each other at their favorite diner. The movie is ok because it isnt very funny. Decent performances regardless and poignant at times. ** 3/4 "},{"Title":"Give me 'American Graffiti', any-day... !","Date":"12 May 2005","Score":"2 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" Although the aforementioned film is not without its OWN hiccoughs as far as I'm concerned, (I rated it one notch higher than this) THAT'S the post-war lifestyle I wanna go back to and experience vicariously! Consisting of 'hot-roddin' and juvenile japes with your mates; and not - as Diner offers us - a bunch of wastrels lazily sprawled around a table spouting cod-philosophy and acting like the lost aristocrats of their youth. (That's when they're not projecting an 'earthier' vibe as an act to try and get laid, of course... !) The only historic thing about this movie, to my mind, is the number of players that this proved to be a breakthrough for. Sad then, really, that some of them have regressed only to parodying aspects of their personality in this. (Reiser, Guttenberg) Mickey Rourke, however, gives the most natural and vivid performance of his career - and so early on, too! The Diner is the gang's own little retreat; unfortunately, it seemed 'Closed Indefinitely' to people like me. That is - in cinematic terms, at least - someone who prefers to see people try and face up to their inadequacies, rather than perpetually running away from them... "}]
