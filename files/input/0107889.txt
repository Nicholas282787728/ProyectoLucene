[{"Title":"Underrated, Accurate Football Movie Starring the Godfather's James Caan","Date":"20 October 2005","Score":"18 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sport","Review":" Trips Bunch. The Power I. The Cover 2. If you know what these terms mean, and understand their uses in football strategy, then you'll really enjoy watching David S. Ward's the Program. Ward also wrote and directed Major League, a great movie; however, with The Program, it is obvious how much his sports writing style has evolved.The movie traces one season of college football for a once dominant, but now struggling Division 1 powerhouse, the fictional ESU Timeberwolves. James Caan is hilarious and well-cast as the Head Coach on the hot seat, and it's really great watching him deal with serious issues both on and off the field. Craig Shaeffer does a solid job at both his role and the QB position. His character is like a young, much more tortured Steve Young he can throw the long ball, he can buy time with his feet, and he can do it all while battling inner demons. Omar Epps (the Wood) is simply perfectly cast as Darnell Jefferson, the prototype freshman Tailback fighting for his spot on the 1st team (plus the beautiful Halle Berry plays his love interest).The movie is filled with hilariously awesome lines and performances, and is a classic among people who actually play football. While the editing work could be scrutinized among movie Nazis (the editing job when Kane and his girl are riding his motorcycle is questionable at times), the good far outweighs the bad. Namely, the in-helmet camera work really puts you on the field with them. Overall, David S. Ward does an excellent job of jumping from perspective to perspective, and it quickly builds into this chaotic, early 90s mosaic of Division 1 college football. And surprisingly, the issues explored in the film really resonate with the issues going on in today's sports (i.e. Steroids, Motorcycle death wishes).Listen, if you haven't seen this movie, and you love football, and are of mild intelligence, then you are either really young or really lucky that you missed it because I wish i could watch it again for the first time. However, if you have no appreciation for the game of football, you're better off going elsewhere. Football idealists, be warned as well. This movie is the anti-Rudy. It's the story of one school's fight for a bowl bid, and fighting for that bid at all costs.PS- My vote is very biased. I love to quote this movie with friends. I love to watch football on both Saturday and Sunday. I play fantasy football. I play Madden. I played Division 3 football in college. You have been warned.

OK, so it doesn't rank up there with Brian's Song or is as flashy and symbolic as Any Given Sunday.Maybe it doesn't have the attitude of The Last Boy Scout or North Dallas Forty; it lacks the comic appeal of Necessary Roughness. But you know what it does have that all of those above-mentioned films lack, a connection to any person that has ever stepped out on that field and experienced the pressures and bliss that comes with the nitty gritty game of football. I remember seeing this movie in the sixth grade and having never been into football that much, I didn't expect a lot. Yet,I walked away in awe at the sheer excitement experienced from this movie. This was an instant classic and even years later in my high school football days, the players were still talking about it. It is one of the best and most realistic football movies made. It puts you in the mindset of a big play maker like Jefferson or a back-breaking linebacker like Alvin Mack. It also has its human side displaying the pressures of trying to live up to expectations and coping anyway you know how. In Joe's case it's through a bottle. Lattimer sees enhancement drugs as the only way out...the film just takes you down to their level. Better yet, it's a college experience that you haven't experienced yet, or are trying to remember (it goes so fast!). After viewing this movie so many times every year when the college ball season starts, or even back in the day before two-a-days began; I can't help but to get excited and giddy from viewing it. My tape has worn out and I now own the DVD, I just wish they would add the deleted scenes. The Program will always be on my top ten list and that's why I give it a great rating.  "},{"Title":"Getting With The Program","Date":"17 July 2007","Score":"8 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sport","Review":" The Program may very well be the best film on college football ever done in that it shows its not quite the way it was when Pat O'Brien was playing Knute Rockne or even when Knute Rockne himself was coaching at Notre Dame.During the Nineties another classic film about professional football was done, Any Given Sunday. The main theme about Any Given Sunday was that sports was now more business than anything else. But pro football has always been a business. What The Program shows is just how much a business college football is, yet it maintains the fiction that this is amateur athletics. As is so eloquently put, no one is going to pay for a ticket to see a chemistry exam. Football with its ticket revenue, its alumni contributions, it's TV and radio rights, it's memorabilia rights is a very big business. It brings in money for the colleges, hence the colleges have a vested interest in a winning team. And some will do quite a bit more than others.James Caan does a fine job as the coach of mythical ESU who is a decent man caught up in the system. He operates his program straining the bounds of ethics. He knows full well that some of his kids are being greased right through college without an education, but football is his life and living and Caan operates the best he can.His players are a cross section of young America. Craig Sheffer is the very talented quarterback from a white trash background trying hard to rise above it. Omar Epps is the inner city ghetto kid who sees football as his ticket out. Andrew Bryniarski is the defensive player that steroids gave us, something Caan pretends not to notice until it really smacks him in the face. By the way Bryniarski was also in Any Given Sunday.My favorite in the entire film is Duane Davis who is another kid from the ghetto who both really loves the game, can barely read and write, and who also sees it as a way of rising from poverty. He's a nice kid, but a bad influence on Epps who he constantly tells that The Program will grease him through. Davis just lives for that National Football League contract.I do love the way Davis psyches himself before a scrimmage. You have to see the film to appreciate. Sad to say his is the saddest of all the stories here. You have to be made of stone to not be moved by seeing him at home, leg in a cast, listening to the final championship game with his mother, knowing the future he foresaw for himself is blasted to smithereens.Halle Berry and Kristy Swanson are there as love interests to both Epps and Sheffer respectively. There characters are quite a bit more than the usual air-headed cheerleaders cast in these parts. Another good performance is John Maynard Pennell as Sheffer's second string backup. He romances and talks Caan's daughter into taking an exam for him. When she's caught both are expelled. Caan personally kicks him out of the university and then has to swallow his pride and a good deal more to bring Pennell back when Sheffer has to go into rehab. That's also a classic scene.The Program is one of the finest, if not the finest film on college football ever done. I think more than sports fans will appreciate this finely crafted piece of cinema.

Speaking from experience as a college player, most of the things in this movie are grossly exaggerrated (no teammates I played with ever wanted me to spit in their mouth). However, there are a few revealing moments in this movie that capture life on a college football program.

It doesn't have all the clichés that normal football movies have where the starting quarterback gets the beautiful cheerleader and any certain game is won at the buzzer on some totally bizarre play. It's about the truth of what goes on in the college game. Sure, this stuff doesn't happen everywhere, but it certain frickin' happens. I'm talking about the steroids, the football players being allowed a free pass when it comes to academics, the fact that some people cannot even read but are able to go to college just to play a damn game.This movie shows it all. James Caan does a perfect job of playing the coach trying to keep it all together. Although he is corrupted just as much as his players, he had his own problems to worry about with losing his job so he had a big balancing act to perform. This movie was NOT about triumph, it's about tragedy and sacrifice that young men make just to be a top player in a sport which in the long run normally doesn't amount to anything.Great watch for you people who don't know much about the behind the scenes stuff and if you haven't seen this movie and are interested in college football, check it out. It's not necessarily a greatly acted movie, but it's a very telling movie which more people should pay attention to. 7 out of 10 in my book for what it's worth.

The action looked realistic and that is the least (and most) that I expect in a sports movie.  And playing Welcome to the Jungle by Guns N' Roses during a football practice is surely worthy of some credit.  All in all the game footage was pretty short, a few minutes at a time.  What was more interesting, and what the film focuses on most, was what happened to the players between games as they dealt with their personal lives and game preparation.I'm guessing the movie was trying to shock us with this part.  Steroid abuse by one player; alcohol abuse, a bar fight, and suicidal tendencies by another; cheating on an exam by yet another and his subsequent expulsion then reinstatement; girl problems with a couple players; etc.  The movie has a lot to say and it's a good message, but I didn't find this shocking.  Rather this sort of things is really common knowledge among sports fans, although how rampant these issues actually are in real life I can only guess.  Having said that, this part of the film is done well for the most part.  The one exception is the relationship stuff, which I just didn't find very believable due to a lack of chemistry between the participants.Addressing two of the criticisms that I have read others say about this film.  Yes, it does tend to follow a lot of players and their respective issues, but I didn't feel that it spread itself too thin.  I thought that despite this fact it did feel like we followed each player enough to get to know the issues he faced.  The movie seemed to take a snapshot of one player and what he was dealing with, then quickly moved on to the next, and I thought in the context of this film it worked quite well.The second criticism I have read is that everything ends up working out well for everyone in the end and everyone comes out a better person.  This just isn't true at all.**SPOILER ALERT**The defensive end (Alvin Mack I believe) busted up his knee and at the end of the movie it appeared that he would never play again.  This was surely the most poignant moment in the film.  Lattimer, the one with the steroid problem, was back on the juice and you get the feeling he won't ever lick this problem.  Even Joe Kane will likely struggle with booze indefinitely.  So I actually give this film a lot credit for not choosing the cliched ending where everyone ends up happy.**END OF SPOILER ALERT**7/10 - for an overall solid effort "},{"Title":"what college football is really like","Date":"11 October 2000","Score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sport","Review":"  This is a great football movie.

No its about the Program, yeah the program. I was scratching my head recently trying to remember this movie which i thought may have had Cuba Gooding JR in it about football. These two scenes kept playing out in my head, one was of a bunch of guys on the yellow line in the middle of a two lane street lying down head to foot while cars rushed by. The other was of this guy head-butting car windows. Well thats all i had to go on and after much scouring i found the movie the same place i always do. In a thrift store for a dollar! So i run home and toss it in waiting to see this part with the team on the ground in the street, and its not there. Apparently life imitates art and people who saw the original screening took to the streets and lay down in traffic. Some people died and plenty were hurt in a scarring prospect that left filmmakers to delete, and destroy the negative. I actually thought the movie was pretty good sides that and the head-butting scene is totally in tact. I wonder how many people head-butted cars after this? Or did steroids, this movie has an odd charm. I only played pop warner so i don't know if this is an accurate portrayal of college football, but really does it matter? were not exactly talking about portraying Jesus Christ here, its football and despite the name feet are mostly used just for running. Bunch of up and comers and well established actors and actresses in this one. Done well, it was worth the dollar, but in all honesty it was good. Seven thumbs.

His quarterback Joe Kane (Craig Sheffer) is dealing with an alcoholic father and a Heisman campaign. He falls for tennis player Camille Shafer (Kristy Swanson). The big recruiting effort is tailback Darnell Jefferson (Omar Epps) and they use female student Autumn Haley (Halle Berry) as the lure. Once in school, he finds that she already has a boyfriend who is the starting tailback. Alvin Mack promises to buy his mother a house counting on signing an NFL contract. Andrew Bryniarski is the muscle-bound lineman found using steroids and attacking a girl.This seems like a greatest hit of college football scandals. The scattered approach leaves this problematic. I don't have a big problem with any of the stories but none of them really takes the lead. Sheffer isn't compelling enough to be the star. Omar Epps comes close to be star material and it would be interesting to have him as the lead character. There are just too many main story material.

The young guys playing the football stars were believable and well prepped. I also loved James Caan character. He seemed like a genuine college coach who had flaws, and issues along with that something that makes him who he is!. Also this was one of the very first movies I saw about college life for an inner city youth and college football shown from a darker perspective. Omar Epps character is so well thought out and that I wish we could have seen more of him, more of his highlights, a better background story. I loved the fact the kid came from the city and was big time. But at the same time, i barely felt like i was part of his big time life in high school like i think a Boobie Miles may have felt back in the same time. I understand thats Texas but you get my drift.I really liked how the kids had their own issues and families and problems displayed throughout the movie as well. It made it so much more believable, i wish they would make a revamped version where we can actually feel that Heisman race in full effect.Overall I think this is one of the best college football movies ever made, The movie should be longer to add small details, i wouldn't mind one bit. I loved it and have to give it 9 out of 10 baby! --Only because when you look at the genre of College Football/ Football movies in general, this one actually ranks very high among the best ever in my opinion.

It wasn't until 20/20 reminded people of various scandals in college football (the 77-87 SMU mustangs are the perfect example of this movie) that the American public saw just how far players and schools will go to win.I still look at this movie with some sadness. You see how a player is treated with kid gloves when they are All-Americans, and when they are injured permanently and are of no use to the team, they are chewed up and spit out and quickly forgotten.

The Program is a little extreme in its examples of how college football programs can help their athletes out. Granted I play for a small division II school in Michigan, but have been recruited by D I schools and do know many players from U of M and MSU in particular.  The assistance shown in the movie is somewhat true to the advantages one receives for being a college athlete but indeed too extreme. The writers and producers of this movie obviously intended it for entertainment and maybe to increase suspicion towards college athletics, and they do just that.

The major problem that I see is that David Ward tries to throw as many football cliches into an hour and a half movie as he can and, for the most part, the actors fail to rise above the mediocre script.The cast is a talented one and this film helped to propel the careers of some semi-stars and one super star, but in the end the cliches are too much to overcome.  We have Caan (who I have, do, and always will love no matter what roles he chooses) playing the long-time head coach whose job seems to be in jeopardy.  And there's Craig Sheffer playing Heisman hopeful Joe Kane. Sheffer was wonderful in Robert Redford's adaptation of Norm MacLean's A River Runs through It, but here he can't escape the cliche of the out-of-control star quarterback with father-son issues and a need to live life dangerously.We also catch glimpses of the pumped up steroid user, the illiterate student athlete, the promising young freshman (Omar Epps), and the incumbent whose position he is trying to win.Halle Berry, Kristy Swanson, and Joey Lauren Adams add some sex appeal to the film, but those early '90s wardrobes are hideous.In my opinion this movie tries to show too much of everything, and in doing so, fails to show enough of anything.   More of the plot should have been dedicated to the characters of Caan, Sheffer, or Epps in order to establish a better connection with the audience.The football sequences are well done--I don't think any football movie has anything on this film here--but the characters aren't given enough time to develop.Some things that annoy me about this movie --Omar Epp's taunting as he is returning punts.  It's so cheesy. --The terribly dated musical score.

It's a realistic drama/sports film focusing on a handful of players and their stories as individuals and members of the ESU Timberwolves.I was well into the second half of the film when it dawned on me that I was into the characters' stories and had forgotten I was watching a movie, which is always a good sign. The characters include the quarterback (Craig Sheffer) who has to deal with the incredible pressure of his position and the fact that his Dad's an aloof drunkard who's given up on life; the linebacker who takes steroids to compete and starts to become a rage-oholic; the black dude from the ghetto who memorizes big words to appear smart; and more. For most of them, their lives and futures hinge on the game and so getting seriously injured can wipe out their very reason for existence. James Caan is notable as the coach.As for women, there's Halle Berry in her prime and Kristy Swanson, but their roles are too limited and there are essentially no other women to be found, except cheerleaders & students in the background.People who have played university football have pointed out that The Program is realistic in its depiction. It's a really good sports film for sure, but 1999's Varsity Blues, which focuses on Texas high school football, edges it out. In fact, Varsity Blues ranks with my all-time favorite movies; it's got a more compelling story & characters, a funner vibe and better women. But both of them are must-see sports flicks.The film runs 112 minutes and was shot at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, and the University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC.GRADE B+ "},{"Title":"i didn't like it as much as Friday Night Lights...,but","Date":"7 April 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sport","Review":" i still liked it.i just felt that ...Nights had a stronger story,and i was more emotionally involved.i also found the characters mote compelling.for me the program dragged at times,when there were scenes not involving football.fortunately these scenes weren't very long,and there weren't a lot of them.of all the actors in the movie,i was most impressed with Kristy Swanson and Halle Berry,though bad had fairly small roles.the program was entertaining enough to keep watching,i just didn't think it was spectacular.is it worth buying?hard to say.but i do think it's certainly worth catching on premium cable or as rental.these are just my thoughts.my vote for the program7/10 "},{"Title":"Terrible Movie!","Date":"21 October 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sport","Review":" I was just reading one of the user comments here that hailed this as one of the best football movies of the 90's next to varsity blues come one people, both of these movies are terrible and in no way depict what real football is like, but only rather what a stereotype by an ignorant person would think.

Not that any of those were pure football movies, but maybe that's why I enjoyed them. So I didn't look at The Program from the eyes of a football fan, but from the perspective of whether it's a good movie or not. Certainly it's very professionally made and acted, and the football scenes are pretty exciting. (The point-of-view shots with the football helmet's bars in the foreground made you feel like you were there, as in any self-respecting shoot 'em up video game.)The main reason why I was attracted to give The Program a peek was that I was in a James Caan state of mind... having recently seen him in Warden of Red Rock, and rediscovering what a fine actor he can be. My first disappointment is that Caan, as the coach, is present mainly as a vehicle to keep the film moving along. He fixes things  when the boys screw up, acts tough, makes appropriate facial expressions... and is basically a one-dimensional character with no depth. Naturally, the film has decided to focus on the lives of the football players, as youth sells.Basically, we pursue the love lives of two jocks. Joe makes a play for Camille (played by the original Buffy, Kristy Swanson), while Darnell zeroes in on Autumn (Halle Berry... who helps make the movie come alive), after suckering her to tutor him. In both instances, both women are vehemently against dating these guys. (Camille, in fact, flat out states that she does not go out with football players; she ultimately does so by losing a bet.) Now, it's nothing new in movies... as sometimes in real life... for a fellow to court a reluctant girl only to win her over at the end. I know we like to see that sort of thing. However, neither of these young men had the kinds of characteristics that would turn these girls' pretty heads in the manner that they did. Darnell's sweet, but not educated enough to hold a sharp gal like Autumn for long; and Joe can be a smarty-pants, smirking jerk at times, especially for a hard-nosed and demanding sort that Camille is initially established to be.However, not only do the girls fall for these guys (and, granted, some women have been known to fall in love for no good reason)... but they do so in a totally devoted and nearly altruistic way. I could have bought one of the female characters doing so, but both? How very unrealistic; in real life, unless a woman feels that immediate click... before surrendering so completely... usually she will make a man jump through many more hoops than what these lucky b******s go through. We're just moving the plot along, folks.This is a great display of how Hollywood movies are made... I can imagine the screenplay being discussed by the marketing whizzes at Disney, where the committee of account executives decided that everything should safely and neatly fall into place. All the predictable cliches have that neat, happy ending... Darnell finally bonds with his rival, for example; Joe's neglectful father is shown tuning into to his son's big game. Yes, the movie pushes the right buttons, but there is no soul within; like in so many Hollywood cookie-cutter films... films that are, too often, hard to distinguish one from the next.

It's very well made with a lot of exciting football action, plus the character development was excellent!. I really got to know and feel for the characters, and they were all very likable. The script was excellent and very well written and it had 3 very strong leads. I wasn't expecting much from this movie, it had a great cast but that's about it and it didn't look that appealing to me (MY sister lent it to me so. The direction is great lots of great shots during the Football scenes , wonderful shots of the crowd a lot of really cool zoom in's when the linebackers are closing in on the quarter backs , and keeping it at a perfect pace! great job David!. The acting is EXCELLENT!. James Caan does an excellent job here as the Coach and gave his usual intense performance and i loved it!. Halle Berry was also excellent here and had very good chemistry with Omar Epps!, plus she is beautiful.Omar Epps was AWESOME here and was my 2nd favorite character here, he gave a perfect performance creating a lot of depth to his performance and gave a WONDERFUL performance!. Craig Sheffer was OUTSTANDING here! he hit all the right emotional notes perfectly and gave an OUTSTANDING performance and i felt sorry for his character, plus his chemistry with Kristy Swanson was great, plus he looked like a true Pro! out there(he was my favorite character here. Kristy Swanson was fine with what she had to do and certainly looked good but wasn't on screen that much, but she had good chemistry with Sheffer!.Duane Davis does what he has to do well. Joey Lauren Adams has a couple appearances. Andrew Bryniarski is fine as the Steroid freak and J. Leon Pridgen II is good as the overly jealous boyfriend, Jon Pennell does what he has to do as the Backup QB. Overall. i highly recommend this little gem! **** out of 5 "},{"Title":"Clichéd but still an OK genre film","Date":"16 May 2004","Score":"3 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sport","Review":"  The college football team of the Timberwolves is made up of students from all over America and of all sorts of background. Joe Kane is the team's poster boy and is tipped to go all the way to the NFL; Darnell is a rookie from the tough streets looking for a break with the team and his tutor Autumn and the rest of the team are made up of steroid takers, trash takers and course flunkers. With all this raw aggressions and raw ability, Coach Winters must try and hold it all together despite his own problems.It has been so many years since it came out that many viewers will have forgotten the fuss that made this film better known than it really deserved to be at the time. I won't go into it but I really fail to see (aside from the one impersonation) why a scene involving chicken with cars was cut yet a scene involving chicken with trains was left in &#150; surely if one was unsuitable then the other should be so too? Now, over 10 years later the film remains more famous that it deserves on the back of some fortunate casting &#150; it was the cast list that attracted to this film. The actual story is a fairly ho-hum sports movie with all the usual clichés about college sports as well as the usual semi-drama stories around the characters &#150; overcoming bad backgrounds, party excesses, girl troubles and so on. As a basic sports movie it is enjoyable enough but it doesn't really do anything that makes it stand out from the genre.The cast is the ongoing selling point of the film and the performances are OK considering that the material doesn't give them a great deal to do other than go through the genre motions. Caan plays a grizzly old coach who has to cover the player's indiscretions and he does it well enough. Berry looks OK but has little to do in a very male dominated film. Sheffer is supposed to be the lead role but he doesn't really have the ability and he is easily swallowed up by his support cast. Epps is good and minor female roles are also given to Swanson and Adams. Bryniarski overplays his steroid addict but still works and I thought Davis showed a gentle touch when he was given the chance to in minor scenes during the final game.Overall, aside from the controversy that helped it getting a bigger audience at the time of release and the good list of names in the cast, this is actually just a competent film rather than a really good one. It has all the usual clichés that you expect from college sports films and it doesn't do anything special with them but it doesn't do them badly either. Entertaining as along as you know what to expect.

The kid is a natural, but he's a natural with problems.  But this kid's problems are just a tiny few pages in the big book of the problems the coach has to face.This is a film designed to be, realistically, about the problems concerning a major college football team.  I'd say that there were a few too many problems for one team to deal with, but that's what you get, I guess, when you get 80 little maniacs running around in front of a camera.  A few of them have to come up with problems, otherwise we would not have a movie...Believable, no...if any coach were to come as close as Caan did to breaking the rules or drawing that kind of negative attention, then those kids would be gone...but, then, there's poetic license and we would not have a movie...Five out of ten...barely!

It's about a bunch of people from a university learning the pressures of football. They really want to win a big game. Competition divides them talent unites them. They do win their football game.

Like most sports film it tries to reveal a stoic creed of fraternity amongst the players, but comes off looking like a bad join the army/mom&pop/apple pie americana promotion. the male/female connections in the film are barely believable and exhibit almost no chemistry. the only redeeming facet is the performance of the steroid-abusing lineman who approaches each game with some sort of indian-death battle mentality.

You can watch it too!","Date":"6 April 2004","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sport","Review":"  Well the only reason I saw this film is because Halle Berry was in it. The DVD is presented in widescreen format and offers no special features (unless you count English captions and a keep case special... let alone features!). The Program had a street-chicken scene removed because some child imitated the scene and got himself killed. So it was in the actual theatrical presentation for a little while, but was cut while still in theaters. The Program on DVD is little more than itself on VHS.Rated R for language and brief nudity (bare male backside), this film drama is not so deep and imaginative results lead to resolutions. The ESU backdrop is actually Duke University in South Carolina so their stadium is where the football action happens. The football is core to the film, but there are five players with short stories to tell on and off the field The plight of the college athlete... Siskel and Ebert liked it though.Halle Berry, Andrew Byrniarski, and Duane Davis are the best things about this movie. Berry's figure is wasted in this movie, but she still delivers her part well as token love interest (such a nice, decent girl). Byrniarski and Davis have the most entertaining problems and dialogue respectively. Craig Sheffer as Joe Kane is the male lead not James Caan. Caan doesn't do much but play coach.My final thoughts are that Halle Berry should have been a smart and sassy gold digger who slapped someone (anyone will do), Byrniarski should have gone for the full monty, shower and locker scenes should have been visually R-rated too with better casting, Craig Sheffer isn't cute enough to be a quarterback, and the movie should have ended. Just how did the season end? I'd like to know. Other than that, The Program is an okay film, but I wouldn't recommend it.

One of the  lamest films about college football proved to  be one of the most poorly acted ones. Sure,  Omar Epps and James Caan were solid, but   the list of no-names dotting the cast list was too  much to overcome in this rather lame effort.  Fortunately, Oliver Stone made a better, more  lucent film in Any Given Sunday. Sadly, football  films will prove to be the most difficult of all the  sports to turn into a movie.

James Caan dominates the film as the head coach who has seen it all and, after two losing seasons in a row, knows he needs a winner . Has this guy ever been in a really bad movie or given a bad performance? Goes back a long ways - he was making movies with John Wayne in the 60s.Hale Berry (before she became a star) has a big part as the tutor to the star RB. Even looks pretty for about the only time in her career. But the real appeal is Kristy Swanson, the most beautiful women in film history. She plays the QB's girl and is her usual knockout self, though she looks a few pounds overweight. "}]
