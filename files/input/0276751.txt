[{"Title":"a sterling comic gem","Date":"8 June 2002","Score":"92 out of 101 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I think I smiled all the way through `About a Boy,' a comic near-masterpiece derived from the best-selling novel by Nick Hornby.  For the sake of accuracy, both the novel and the film should more rightly be titled `About TWO Boys,' since the story focuses not only on 12-year old Marcus, but on 38-year old Will, a man totally dedicated to the proposition that any man who so desires can live quite happily on his own private little urban island, thank you very much.  Will's `island' is his own London flat, which he has equipped with all the accoutrements of comfort and diversion that modern technology &#150; in the form of computers, big screen TV's and DVD players - can afford.  Who needs people when you have so much `stuff' to keep you content and occupied?  Will thrives in his environment, much to the chagrin of his married couple friends who keep insisting that he must certainly be miserable without a wife and family to give his life meaning.  But Will loves being shallow &#150; a fact of his personality he is more than willing to declare right up front &#150; and the last thing he needs &#150; or thinks he needs &#150; is people to clutter it up.  Yet, island dwellers have a tendency not to remain marooned for long, and, before he knows it, Will finds himself striking up a relationship with a lonely, backward boy named Marcus, whose mother suffers from serious bouts of suicidal depression.More than any comedy in recent memory, `About a Boy' establishes a tone and sticks with it to the end.  The screenplay by Peter Hedges, Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz (the latter two function as the film's directors as well) manages to take a potentially clichéd and predictable story and invest it with a warmth, wit and tenderness that are all-enveloping.  The voice-over narration by both Will and Marcus, which introduces us to their characters and keeps us informed as to their mental progress throughout the film, is remarkably clever and droll.  Yet, the characters never come across as smug, smart-alecky or flippant.  Rather, they speak and behave in ways that are both believable and realistic.  Hugh Grant gives his richest performance to date as Will, the man who refuses to grow up and assume the role of responsible adult, blithely unaware of the emotional depths that lie hidden under a surface of apathy and indifference.  The superb Grant is more than matched by relative newcomer Nicholas Hoult, an extraordinarily gifted young actor who doesn't look like the average `adorable' screen kid, and who makes Marcus into a very real, very likable and very sensitive young man.  The remainder of the large cast is outstanding as well.  Moreover, the film is very astute in its observation about just how easy technology has made it for us to isolate ourselves from one another.  Admittedly, a little of the sharpness does go out of the screenplay in its closing stretches, but not enough to diminish one's pleasure appreciably.In many ways, `About a Boy' is a movie that needs to be experienced first hand, since mere words fail to convey the very special charm and spell it manages to cast over the viewer.  Rush to see it.  Comic gems like this one don't come around very often!

If one chooses to use such a situation toward altruistic ends, or at the very least a venture that can provide some personal fulfillment, it says something about who that person is.  On the other hand, if one squanders the opportunity on a totally self-absorbed, shallow existence, it says even more.  And while taking the latter path may provide some interesting moments, it's a cosmetically created, external bubble that serves no other purpose than covering up an empty life, and sooner or later-- to anyone with even a modicum of intelligence-- that bubble is bound to burst; and when it finally happens, when the wake-up call comes, how one responds to it is the ultimate test of character, which is what happens to a such a man in `About A Boy,' directed by Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz, and starring Hugh Grant.As far as Will Freeman (Grant) is concerned, he has the perfect life; he lives comfortably, if not extravagantly, on the income provided by a certain kind of inheritance.  On the surface, at least, he's happy.  Admittedly, however, he's the very epitome of `shallow,' who makes a conscious and concerted effort at avoiding any commitment in relationships, or even attempting to accomplish or achieve anything at all.  He merely takes from life, gives absolutely nothing back and has always been content with it.  But of late, his relationships have become a bit `sticky.'  Women are becoming too demanding, the break-ups too messy.  He needs a new conquest, a relationship in which he can flex his shallowness anew, with a woman who will give him everything and demand nothing in return. Fortuitous circumstances provide him with just what he's looking for; fortuitous, however, in a way he doesn't realize, as it leads to a relationship through which he encounters a young boy, Marcus (Nicholas Hoult).  And it's a meeting that is destined to have an enormous impact on his life, as Marcus becomes the catalyst that changes Will's entire perspective.  For the first time, Will begins to question who he is, and what he's doing-- or not doing-- with his life.Telling this story (adapted for the screen by Peter Hedges and the Weitz brothers, from the novel by Nick Hornby) presented a challenge to the filmmakers, in that it's nothing really new; the history of the cinema is filled with stories of individual epiphanies, many along the same lines as this one (recently, `The Kid,' with Bruce Willis, for example).  So a fresh approach and presentation, including the kind of performances they could extract from their actors, was essential for this film to attain any distinction whatsoever.  Which it does, and splendidly.  And, moreover, they succeed on all fronts.  The screenplay is intelligent, and the characters-- especially Will and Marcus' mom, Fiona (Toni Collette)-- are convincingly well developed.  With Will, there is no sudden leap into who he becomes by the end of the film; it comes though a gradual recognition and realization of who he is, after first establishing a starting point from which the character can grow.  The same is true of Fiona.  There's detours and set-backs which-- as in real life-- prevent a direct journey from point A to point B, and create the proverbial sticky wicket along the way.  Weitz and Weitz set a good pace, and most importantly, manage to give their film some real heart without lapsing into any melodramatic, maudlin sentimentality.  Rather, the sentiments and situations they express are real and believable, and presented in such a way as to afford the audience any number of elements to which they can genuinely relate.As Will, Hugh Grant gives arguably his best performance ever.  In some respects, Will is similar to other characters Grant has created (most notably Daniel in `Bridget Jones's Diary'), but there's a depth to Will he's never previously managed to achieve, and without question this is his most three-dimensional, fully developed character yet.  Grant has a natural charm and a charismatic screen presence, but his presentation is often tinged with a bit of pretentiousness that is entirely absent here.  He does an especially nice job of effecting Will's transition in very real and credible terms, and by the end, it's obvious that this is a side of Grant we have not seen before; with this role, he has effectively expanded his range as an actor.  In the final analysis, it's a performance with real substance, and it makes Will a truly memorable character.The young Hoult brings Marcus convincingly to life, as well, with an extremely natural performance, in which he commendably manages to avoid the trappings of stereotype into which this character could easily have fallen.  Some credit must go to his directors, of course, but it's Hoult who makes it especially believable in the way he responds, for instance, to certain given situations that typically seem to evoke a particular reaction when being depicted on screen (his rather introspective response to the taunts of his school mates, for example; quite different than what is usually portrayed in film).  And in their scenes together, Grant and Hoult strike a chord of reality that finally assures the overall success of this film.The supporting cast includes Rachel Weisz (Rachel), Isabel Brook (Angie), Sharon Small (Christine), Victoria Smurfit (Suzie) and Nat Gastiain Tena (Ellie).  Entertaining, as well as insightful, `About A Boy' gives a truly fresh perspective to an element of the human condition that has been explored before, but rarely as effectively.  The Weitz Brothers make the subject of their film accessible to a wide audience, and in a way that is engaging and satisfying.  This film is going to be a pleasant surprise to many who see it, in that it delivers a whole lot more than most would expect.  And that's the magic of the movies.  9/10.

And he's quite funny too","Date":"26 June 2002","Score":"62 out of 78 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  `About a Boy' was being touted as a great make over for Hugh Grant&#133; and it is. Gone is his infamous bumbling English fop role, his fluffy hair lost to a sharp, more stylish cut. Here he plays a rich selfish layabout, Will, who cruises through life on the royalties from a song his deceased father penned years ago. He finds a great way to meet women who don't want to get involved through a single mother's group &#150; which is where he meets the strange twelve year old boy Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), who lives with his depressed, suicidal mother Fiona (Toni Collette). A tragic event sees Marcus seeking comfort with the indifferent Will who begins to realise that there's more to life than sitting around at home all day.Hugh Grant is on peak form here &#150; he sheds his old roles for that of a fresher, younger man. He is able to convey charm and selfishness not just through words, but also through his mannerisms. He even conveys genuine affable warmth later on in the movie, without making my teeth grate&#133; Equally impressive is Toni Collette as Marcus' sad mother. Her character has a tragic feeling to it, a real sense of world-weariness conveyed in a great combination of makeup and acting. The real star of the movie &#150; for me- is Nicholas Hoult as the young boy who helps Will come to realizations about his life. He doesn't get by on cute good looks, like far too many kid actors, because he can actually act &#150; from the innocence of a child (when he tries to get his mother and Will together), to the simplistic musings of children who can't understand why some people hurt (such as his mother). Like Osment (whom he amusing compares himself to), Hoult shows that child actors are just as, if not more so, capable as their elders.The script of the movie is witty, without being outright hilarious. It's what you come to expect of the British comedy market (the weak `Ali G indahouse' aside). It being a British comedy you can predict where it's going to go and there are relatively few surprises along the way. Having said that the characters are sketched strongly enough, and the humour at a high enough level, that you'll be more than entertained along the way.It's surprising to see that this movie was directed by the `American Pie' Weitz brothers, because they bring a thoughtful, contemplative air to the movie, while never getting bogged down in pointless camera techniques &#150; the most we're left with is some simple screen wipes. They've also chosen well by having Badly Drawn Boy compose the whole soundtrack as it works very well with the film's tone.There's nothing outstanding in `About a Boy' but what's here is done surprisingly well. It's a nice movie that's quite enjoyable for relaxing to some evening. A 7/10 seems just. "},{"Title":"Isle Of Hugh","Date":"20 July 2005","Score":"47 out of 58 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Sometimes a rut can feel like a hammock when we get stuck in one.About A Boy is about a Londoner who was apparently born into one, imprisoned as it were by his father's legacy as author of one of the world's most popular and annoying Christmas songs. After years of feckless unemployed upper-middle-class living, Will views himself as an island, and sees his lack of long-term relationships as a plus. Even offered the simple honor of being an infant's godfather, Will begs off, saying he'd be crap at it and probably just try and shag the girl the moment she turned 18.I always thought you had hidden depths, the mother says.No, you've always had that wrong, Will cheerfully replies. I really am this shallow.But of course Will does have depths, and as played by Hugh Grant in a role that gives this smooth comedic actor a chance to showcase some previously-unguessed-at depths of his own, we find ourselves rooting for Will to find them as he finds himself attached unwillingly to a 12-year-old named Marcus, played with welcome non-cuteness by Nicholas Hoult. Marcus, an abuse magnet at school, is alternately worried for his unstable mother and searching for a pal. Will, a 12-year-old at heart, is a perfect if unknowing candidate.Based on the great Nick Hornby novel, About A Boy walks a fine line, doling out easy laughs and real pathos with deceptive ease. Like Hornby's book, the movie depicts Will's perverse detachment from the world as both delightful and pathetic. Life is a full plate of pain for those who participate, but the benefits, as Marcus tries to tell Will, beat all else.Of course, most of us don't have the luxury for island living, and the potential of resenting Will, especially as played by that handsome devil Grant, might have been the film's biggest danger. But Grant defuses things with a subtle characterization that downshifts on the smugness and draws on the lost boy within.For example, when Will tries to infiltrate a single-mothers' club as a way of bagging some commitment-free sex, we watch him tell the mothers about his own non-existent two-year-old boy Ned telling him you hang in there, Dad, then reacting with uncertain fear when the mothers enthuse about how remarkable that is for such a young child.But we also see the pain Will pretends isn't there, in brief flashes as he reflects on the hard-drinking failure his father became after his one-hit wonder, and especially in one great scene where Will finds himself with a woman he really cares about, unable to break out of his artifice at a critical moment. During that scene, and a later, angry one with Marcus, Grant's acting really demands consideration from those who dismiss him as a dandy glamor boy.The directors, Chris and Paul Weitz of American Pie-fame, prove they can make a film that delivers intelligence as well as laughter, and with writer Peter Hedges, fashion a script that takes some clever and daring liberties with Hornby's solid story. I especially liked the one near the end of the movie, but if I revealed anything I'd probably get some Flack for it, so say no more.The very last scene of the movie is a mistake, though, the kind of tidy resolution Hornby's novel and life itself rightly rejects. It's the one bum note in this film, but enough of one to dock it a point with me. Otherwise, I'd have to rate this above even the other cinematic Hornby adaptation, the classic High Fidelity. But this is a very entertaining film, with great set design, a terrific Rubber Soul-style Britpop title song by Badly Drawn Boy, tight editing, and subtle, crafty camera work. Also some great supporting performances, especially Toni Collette as Marcus' mother, who has the film's toughest role (she must be funny and suicidal) and manages to not only pull it off but gives About A Boy a wonderfully unstable center. As About A Boy makes clear, instability is a good thing when it shakes us from our ruts. "},{"Title":"Hugh Grant shines; great coming-of-age movie; bloody hilarious and touching at the same time","Date":"17 June 2005","Score":"43 out of 54 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" In the wonderfully entertaining About A Boy, Hugh Grant shucks everything that made him famous nearly a decade earlier in Four Weddings and a Funeral (the floppy hair, the stuttering, etc.) and ends up giving his best performance to date. He plays Will, a wealthy, happily unemployed, commitment-phobic cad (slightly less insidious than Daniel Cleaver of Bridget Jones's Diary) whose newest ploy is to date single mothers because they are easier to dump. However, he meets Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), the son of a somewhat suicidal mother (Toni Colette), and realizes that he cannot continue living his life so shallowly.This film was based on Nick Hornby's wonderful book of the same name and retains much of the wit and touching humor. The early scenes depicting Will's full, but spiritually empty, life are particularly amusing, with Will dividing the day up into units of time and spending these units on web-based research (finding pics of supermodels with see-through tops), exercise (shooting pool), grooming, and the like. Grant makes his character irresponsible, but remains enormously likable throughout the film. This is important because we start to identify with him, and understand his fears of commitment and helplessness behind his outward superficiality. His mannerisms&#151;Grant's specialty, I think&#151;are v. entertaining to watch; the selfishness, hurt, anger, recognition and more pass across his face effortlessly. The other cast members&#150; Nicholas Hoult, Toni Colette, and Rachel Weisz &#150; are also v. good in their supporting roles and play off each other well.The film doesn't follow the book too closely, however, but does one-up on the book by wisely emphasizing some parts that the book downplays. For example, Rachel (played by Rachel Weisz) only appears for a few pages in the book, but has much more presence in the movie. Through the Rachel character, we see how Will's relationship with her is different from his past shallow ones, and we realize that he is growing up. Also, the movie is filled with great one-liners and sharp, witty dialogue that never feels forced. The movie also employs voice-over function (Will's) very nicely; for example, in one serious scene, Will follows the ambulance to the hospital, looking rather serious, but in his voice-over he says. It was all terrible, just terrible. But driving fast behind the ambulance was fantastic. The character would never say that out loud, but it provides comic relief and the assurance that he is, indeed, very shallow.The strength of About a Boy is in the simplicity and power of its scenes. Not one scene is wasted; each one tells us a wealth about the characters and leads to Will's self-discovery. That, along with Hugh Grant's delightful performance, and backed by a great score from Badly Drawn Boy, make About A Boy one of the most delightful, entertaining, and touching movies I've seen. It's a great feel-good movie. Highly recommended, especially to Hugh Grant fans, or anyone who has ever empathized or sympathized with Will and his situation. One of my favorites. 10/10.

I had read the book shortly before I saw it and when I heard Hugh Grant was going to star and the Weitz brothers were chosen to direct I didn't exactly have high hopes. I thought American Pie was funny and all but this kind of story demanded someone more mature, someone clever. This movie, however, turned out to be all that mature, clever, witty, sensible, honest and, most of all, really funny in such a natural way. Hugh Grant has never been better in any role before or since and the soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy is just perfect for the movie. The only thing they overdid a little was Toni Collette's character. I've never seen a person like that in real life. What I did like was the way they changed the ending for the movie. Usually that's not a good idea but it totally worked here. After all, I still liked High Fidelity a tiny bit better (the movie, not the book), but About A Boy comes very close. If you are just as much a fan of this book/movie as I am, get the DVD. There are wonderful deleted scenes on it, which are as funny as the rest of the movie.

When a new dating trick sees him targeting single mothers because they are easier to dump he unwittingly gets mixed up with Marcus.  Marcus is a 12 year old who is bullied at school because of his hippy life style (forced on him by his mother) and struggles at home with his depressed, suicidal mother.  At first he sees himself helping his mum by getting Will to like her but gradually Marcus and Will get used to each other and have lessons that both can learn.Following the steaming success of High Fidelity, another Hornby book makes the transition.  However credit should be given for setting the movie in England and not moving it somewhere else (cooler).  This however is probably due to the lead being English and very bankable!The story is of course about blokes&#133;.and blokes problems &#150; this is Hornby after all.  The plot is simple but the fact that it done with a great deal of wit makes it come across very easily.  Occasionally the mix of heavy subjects (Marcus's home life) with the comedy of Will's life is a little uneasy, but after a while it mixes better.  The story is pretty revealing &#150; I can see a lot of myself in Will, as many men will, and it is involving then to see Marcus teach him things about life.  However, saying that, the best thing about this is the comedy &#150; when Will is involved it is nearly always laugh out loud funny &#150; and that's most of the time.The directors deal with this film really well &#150; they focus on Grants strengths and also use several really cool visual things to add to the comedy &#150; like quick cuts and freeze frame &#150; but not to the point of annoyance.  Surprising that these guys did American Pie! Not the most subtle or clever of comedies&#133;Grant is excellent here &#150; he easily handles the emotional side of the film and the comedy, but it's in the comedy he excels.  His face plays out as many jokes as his words and he is indeed a master at playing this character. However here he has to work harder than when he does his usual `English-fop' stuff, because Will is selfish and not immediately likeable&#133;..I must admit that at the start I struggled to get into the film because I hate these people who spend their time in Notting Hill cafes living off inheritances etc &#150; so it's a credit to Grant that he carries it off.  Hoult is not as good &#150; he has too much weight to carry.  Hoult has to manage the whole emotional side of the film and at times he can't convince. Collette is good as Fiona but again suffers from not having any of the comedy side of the film.  Rachel Weisz was good in a small role but as far as I'm concerned &#150; if she was making this, then she wasn't making another rubbish Mummy film!Overall this is a successful adaptation of the book.  The emotional side and the comedy at times don't sit well together and at times it all feels very lightweight, but ultimately it all comes together.  Grant is excellent and excels himself here &#150; when he's on screen the film is hilarious and moves fluidly.  Unfortunately it slightly highlights the weaknesses of those around him.

A great many Hollywood brains should take note of what was accomplish in this film.Hugh Grant strikes the right amount of hipness, confusion and complete lack of responsibility in his interpretation of Will.

The rest of the movie is too pious to be funny and too concocted to be emotionally interesting.It's extremely disheartening to read the litany of moonstruck reviews served up by those who call About a Boy an insightful examination of the contemporary male persona.  Hugh Grant's shallow character doesn't have anything to do with the contemporary male persona, or any other male persona for that matter, and thank God for that.This film is so shamelessly sentimental and badly written that I was literally hiding my face under my sweater in several places out of sheer pain and embarrassment.  At other times I was praying to God for the movie to end (checking my watch sadly revealed I was only 45 minutes into the fiasco), and on a later occasion I found myself practicing Buddhist meditation techniques in order to convert the pain of viewing it into an opportunity for growth.  It would indeed be fair to say that watching About a Boy is a religious experience.If you want to see a dashing British comedy of errors about a romantic, bumbling idle young man, go rent an episode of Jeeves and Wooster.

I liked that it wasn't Americanized. The quirkiness and humour is well balanced, witty and clever while amusing. The film is mainly about growth of the characters especially Will, Fiona and Marcus and I loved how it was portrayed in a gradually subtle way. The situations are easy to relate to. Even though the characters live under unusual circumstances like Will choosing not to work because he does not need to, the suicidal Fiona or Marcus regularly visiting Will in order to fix him up with his mom, they are easy to identify with. Hugh Grant is great as the shallow Will. He's cast against type and this is perhaps the role that allows him to stretch his acting further. Nicholas Hoult delivers a natural performance. He's certainly not those movie kids who are made to look cute because the director can't get them to act (so credit does go to the Weitzs). Toni Collette is superb as always. Rachel Weisz makes the best of a small role. The rest of the cast do a good enough job. The soundtrack is gentle and whimsical at times, flowing smoothly with the steady pace.

Whilst this may seem like an unlikely duo, Grant and Hoult manage to pull it off perfectly. The film is well scripted, making sure that it delivers comedy and seriousness at a good level without one over-balancing the other and without ruining the book written by Nick Hornby of which this film was based off of. As well as top performances from Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz, the film also contains excellent music performed by Badly Drawn Boy. The music used in the film further enhances the scenes and emotions that are being conveyed. The main message in the film, is to further prove a famous quote from Jon Bon Jovi stating that No man is an island.. We learn from watching the characters themselves, especially Will, how true this quote is and the importance of having others in your life.

Nicholas Hoult is adorable in his role as Marcus, I absolutely adore him, he'll do anything to make his mother happy, he wears the clothes and shoes she makes him wear, eats all the healthy food she makes him eat, sings the songs she likes (Killing me softly-has become an all time classic in my house because of this film); Toni Collette plays his crazy, vegan, hippy suicidal mother, when she makes him that loaf of organic brown bread that he kills a duck at the park- is one of our favorite scenes. He meets Will (Hugh Grant) who is a self-obsessed bachelor; they both become friends in an intricate and funny way, by Marcus practically barging into Will's life, taking over his home after school. Will, being more hip and into modern ways, tries to buy new sports shoes for Marcus, after he sees all the bullying and tormenting that Marcus is enduring at school, Marcus ends up going home shoeless in the rain. The entry of Rachel Weisz and her strange son in all of this, is also done in a funny way, and I love R.Weisz in everything she does, she is simply stunning. I love the plot, the London scenes, the whole comical story blends into one that has become a favorite with our family.

In recent years, however, he seems to have been trying to broaden is range somewhat. David Grant in 'Small Time Crooks' and Daniel Cleaver in 'Bridget Jones's Diary', although both were drawn from the same privileged background as most of his other roles, were both unsympathetic characters whose outwardly genial nature concealed a selfish and mercenary nature. In 'About a Boy', the film he made immediately after those two, Grant was clearly trying to extend his range a little further. The character he plays here, Will Freeman, is quite open about his defects. Will is in his late thirties but has never done any work since leaving school. He has a private income in the form of royalties from a novelty Christmas song written by his father, an otherwise unsuccessful songwriter who had one smash hit. He lives in a smart London flat and idles away his time watching telephone, playing snooker and listening to music. His relationships with women are confined to brief affairs, because he has a horror of any form of emotional commitment. Hearing John Donne's famous quotation that 'No Man is an Island', Will remarks that he is an island and happy to be one. Although Will has never been married and has no children, he joins a single-parent support group (as its only male member) in order to meet women, believing that single mothers will be easy to seduce. He invents a false story to the effect that he was abandoned by his (non-existent) wife, leaving him to bring up a (non-existent) three-year-old son on his own.He starts to change, however, when he is befriended by Marcus, the twelve-year-old son of one of the women in the group. Marcus's mother, Fiona, is both eccentric and depressive, a sort of latter-day hippie with suicidal tendencies. Marcus is an only child, deeply attached to and protective of his mother, and has grown up a shy, sensitive boy. He is bullied at school by his classmates who see him as weak and 'uncool'. After Fiona makes an unsuccessful suicide attempt, Marcus latches on to Will, seeing him as a substitute father-figure. The film can be seen as the story of how the childish Will learns to be an adult and how Marcus, a boy old before his time, learns to be a child. All the main parts are well played. Although this is not Hugh Grant's most amusing role, it is more psychologically complex than most of his other romantic comedy parts, as Will's character undergoes considerable development. He progresses from the belief that every man is an island to the realisation that even islands can be a part of an archipelago. Toni Collette as Fiona and the lovely Rachel Weisz as Will's love-interest Rachel are both excellent, but the real revelation was the young Nicholas Hoult as the strange and solemn but appealing Marcus. One of the most interesting themes in the film was the way in which it inverted the standard clichés about rebellious youth and convention-bound adults. Marcus attends the sort of middle-class school where the pupils are desperate to gain street credibility by imitating what they imagine (probably inaccurately) to be working-class mores, particularly the mores of working-class black Americans. Lace-up shoes are out; trainers, especially expensive ones, are in. Rap music is cool; Roberta Flack is social death. The youngsters doubtless see their tastes as representing rebellion against adult values, but any rebellion against their own system of values is punished by merciless mockery or bullying. Marcus's predicament is that he is caught between his love for his determinedly nonconformist mother and his desire for popularity with his conformist schoolmates, and Nicholas Hoult was able to suggest both these sides of his personality. Despite some good acting, pertinent social comment and an occasionally witty script, I did not find the plot altogether convincing. I was interested to note that Brad Pitt turned down the role of Will because he found it difficult to believe that a good-looking, wealthy, eligible bachelor would need to lie his way into a single-parent group in order to meet women- interested, because my reaction to this part of the film was exactly the same as Mr Pitt's. I found this whole idea, central to the film's plot, completely implausible, especially as all the women involved had been emotionally scarred by bad experiences with men and would have run a mile from anyone like Will who was only interested in using them for casual sex. I also found it difficult to believe in aspects of Fiona's character; she is supposed to be too poor to buy her son expensive trainers or a CD player, even though she lives in a smart Victorian townhouse in a fashionable district of London. (This is one of those films where differences in interior decorating tastes are used to make a point about differences in character. Fiona's warm, comfortable 'retro' look contrasts with the bare, minimalist décor of Will's flat, suggesting that she is warm-hearted if eccentric, while he is cold and superficial. A similar device is used in other films, such as 'Fatal Attraction' and 'Sleeping with the Enemy').I was, however, pleased to see that the film-makers resisted the temptation to end the film the way Hollywood would probably have ended it, with Will marrying Fiona. Although this is obviously what Marcus would prefer, they are too obviously incompatible to make such an ending plausible. The British cinema is sometimes criticised for its sentimentality, but it can also on occasions be tough-minded. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Do not miss this movie!","Date":"15 February 2003","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" I have watched About A Boy over and over and each time I seem to love it even more.

And of those there are two types the `art' film where the exploration of eye is explicit and the `popular' film, where it is all done in the service of amusement. We have here that last type. I find this type even more interesting than the art films I seek out. There my being is challenged, my mind stretched. With popular films, by definition, all challenges are avoided. And that's precisely why I find this so interesting. It means that the cinematic vocabulary of the eye has moved past pretension to become part of ordinary life.The story is a tossaway vacuous, selfish being develops attachments. The magic of the film is all in how the camera is used extremely self-aware, often providing annotative asides (aided by the voiceover narration), frequently breaking the `third wall.' There is nothing new here. These director brothers are just following the filmschool vocabulary of the active camera.But it _does_ make the project because that's just the stance Hornby takes in his books they are not about people but about people looking at themselves. `High Fidelity' solved the problem -- how to present explicit selfexamination --- differently but competently. Voiceovers were used but to different end. The metalayer was the sound track, in fact the story was about creating the sound track. Some camera adventure was used -- like the alternative versions of Robbin's visit -- but they were slight.Here, a different approach is used. I think it is more apt to Hornby's style which is similarly `popular' in being casual. Advanced ideas put to vacuous use.

The script is tight, direction superb and even the setting is good too make this, in my opinion a just about great film and one that even has room to grow.The story is one that can touch the heart yet also find your funny bone and by the end you should feel well&#x85; very pleasant. It is well timed all the way through and when the romantic areas are explored it holds it's ground making this better than the majority of Romcoms out there. I felt it could have been maybe slightly more laugh out loud but in any case it makes you giggle.Hugh Grant is excellent in the lead role and his relationship with Nicholas Holt is one to be savoured for the future generation of film lovers. Going on to Holt well his talent is plainly seen, not the best actor here but his work with Grant makes both of them shine so much that awards could have been won big time. People like Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz pitch in perfectly and they don't go understated when your done here.Many say this is one film which eclipses it's novel that it's based on and you can see why with such a strong script adapted beautifully and given so much rich depth that you finish the movie feeling you've seen the best of British cinema. I think Chris and Paul Weitz do a good job in directing and are part of the reason why Grant and Holt work so well, the two seem to be able to mould them to each other and get the best out of them.I think the main negativity comes from well very little, yes it lacks substantial comedy but then again, when are many films like this crying with laughter affairs. I felt Nicholas Holt can be poor(yes I know he's a child actor), I just felt he can seem to much like he is being directed and not portraying his true quality as an actor, but other than that very little is wrong with the film.If you like good old romps and a fun old adventure then this is for you as it really spans over a good year to show you truly everything about each main characters life. If your looking to be heart wrenched well I don't think it will make you cry but no doubt it has it's sadder moment but in any case, tissues should not be needed whilst viewing.Overall I think it was Just About an excellent comedy and one that will be remembered for a long time. The chemistry of the leads is truly the stand out point from this movie and without not just the characters but the two actors, this would have been greatly at a disadvantage. Love it or hate it and it be slightly soppy, this movie is sure to have some feeling warm and fuzzy but I accept some others will feel slightly more not annoyed but maybe cheesy seeing as the majority of this movie is very one liner orientated, but they all come out well.

But the whole story depends upon not the boy, nor Hugh Grants's character, but the deceased father we never meet. Had he not been a one-hit wonder, writing the (fictional) super popular Santa's Super Sleigh, allowing Grant's character to live a life off royalties where he does nothing, then there would not have been a story worth filming. Story filmed in and around London.mild SPOILERS follow - Never having worked for even one day, Grant's character intends to challenge the concept that no man is an island, intent to live his life his own way, having a series of short-term, non-committed relationships with women, and of course never having children of his own. The film kicks into high gear when he figures out that attending SPAT meetings (single parents alone together) might be a good place to meet single moms with whom a sexually fulfilling affair might follow. Trouble starts right away when he has to fabricate his 2-year-old son, deserted by mom. In an outing at the park, he meets the boy, a 12-year-old whose mom (Toni Collette) is so messed up that she cries a lot, loves 'Killing Me Softly', and occasionally takes a mild overdose which gets her very sick, and lots of attention. Afterward the boy follows Grant several different days, figures out he is a fraud, blackmails him into letting him drop in every day after school to 'hang out', otherwise expose him and ruin his M.O.There are a number of very funny scenes, Grant meets a new, lovely (Rachel Weisz) single mom with an aggressive son, he still tries to be an 'island', but in the end he finally accepts that relationships, having others to lean on at times, or just complete your existence, is really worth the extra effort. This film doesn't really try to leave a deep message with us, only entertain us, but something had to be written to tie everything up. This film is based on a book, but the last 1/3 of the story was fabricated by the scriptwriters, as discussed in the DVD extras.The DVD has one of the better pictures, always sharp with pleasing colors. The Dolby 5.1 sound has very little in the suround channels. There are several nice extras on the DVD, including performance of the entire fictional song, Santa's Super Sleigh.

In both movies, you have handsome, self-involved male leads leading perfect lives. They both have an epiphany that is based on their relationship with a woman and a young boy and the film concentrates on the transformation of the lead character.I liked About a Boy much better for a couple of reasons. First, Will (Hugh Grant)'s epiphany is much more subtle and happens throughout the film, and happens as a result of him indulging his own character flaws (ie this all starts due to his grand idea of picking up single mothers at a support group meeting). Second, the relationship with the boy is not a slam dunk. Who wouldn't love the kid in Jerry Maguire? The boy here is annoying, self-righteous, talkative and understandably friendless. Dumping him and getting on with his life would have been much more in character for Will - we feel almost like a proud parent as we watch him grow more and more attached to him.This movie is Hugh Grant's finest hour. He gets to play his handsome, bumbling polite Englishman, but this time, it is wrapped in a selfish playboy with lots of money and no apparant job. A dream life, or so it would seem. Grant effortlessly draws us into this character and allows us to feel the emptiness of his life, but also his frustration and lack of will to change it. As he says,  I was the star of the Will show and it was not an ensemble drama.About a boy is not a chick flick. It is a good-hearted comedy about a man who makes decisions against every selfish instinct that has dictated his life. It is a breath of fresh air in the world of car chases and special effects.

At the same stage I was wondering when `romantic comedy' became a euphemism for 'inoffensive date movie'. The film shed little light on the facts behind either theory, but succeeded in proving them both as true and unchangeable as rush hour traffic. The story follows Will, a fashionable layabout with no cares in the world, and Marcus, a 12-year old boy with a manically depressed hippy for a mother whose school life makes a working week in a sweatshop seem attractive. The unlikely pair end up together when Will's plan to date single mothers for some hassle free relationships backfires in the most ironic way possible. We are then treated to the usual selection of writer Nick Hornby's pop culture observations and comic characterisations of nerdy males having to contend with the concept of a serious relationship and real life. Whilst the electric prose of his debut 'Fever Pitch' has faded through his later works Hornby still has the power to leave a readers jaw hanging in the breeze by having his generally likeable protagonists commit truly nasty acts. It is this risk taking and realism that gives his writing an edge. Unfortunately the film adaptations of his books merely see him as the new Cameron Crowe, and 'About A Boy' offers a double jackpot with the smart arse kiddie factor that was so successful in Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous. It is depressingly predictable that the casting tells you everything you need to know about the film. Hugh Grant can make a mass murderer seem like an amusingly misunderstood guy, so his portrayal of Will seems charming to the point of sainthood, whilst Rachel Weitz may as well have 'attractive love interest' stapled to her forehead the way the make-up and lighting departments have obviously fawned over her. Grant's spiky hair cut and characterisations can't stop the audience warming to him, where someone like Richard E Grant could have given the character real sleaze, anger and most of all depth. Such safe playing production touches smother the original touches of the film. The homespun soundtrack, completely composed by Badly Drawn Boy, is cut so slickly into the film it starts sounding like a selection from Time Life music 'acoustic love moods' CD. This wrecks the rare pleasure of having a maverick songwriter given creative control over a movies entire soundscape (at Hornby's request no less). Toni Collete's gutsy performance as Marcus' mother is edited down to little more than a hippy-chic cameo of her Muriel's Wedding persona and idiosyncratic touches such as man and boy bonding over Countdown are poorly handled. If this wasn't enough to send the viewers higher brain functions to sleep we are given not one but two voiceovers in the film to make sure every nuance of every performance is clearly explained with no hint of ambiguity, thereby killing off any depth that accidentally may have been left in the film. Despite this Grant's charm carries the film safely to it's conclusion with a few belly laughs along the way. But this never excuses the fact that the film lacks the consistency of jokes to survive as comedy or the emotive depth to work as drama. In short it is another film which has lead to the words `romantic comedy' describing films which are generally neither one nor the other.

Nevertheless, Grant really is charming and witty, and he's got that perfect swagger that lets you know exactly where he stands.In 'About A Boy', Grant plays Will, a thirty-something bachelor who has made a life out of doing absolutely nothing productive. His father wrote a hit Christmas song, and he's been living off the royalties. Will has never had a meaningful relationship that lasted more than one month, and his life (in his opinion) ROCKS. One of the things that I liked about the movie was Grant's utter believability He knows his life is meaningless, and he doesn't care. That is, until Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) comes into his life. Will has adopted a new target group for dating Single moms. Through a single parents support group (he lies to get in), he meets Fiona (Toni Collette) and Marcus. Marcus is rather lonely, and after a series of circumstances, he ends up at Will's house watching TV.

I finally got around to seeing it recently on DVD and I can say with much certainty that it's one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. I guess I was expecting a typical sort of Hugh Grant romantic comedy, but it's nothing like that at all. I found it very similar in tone to movies like Rushmore and even American Beauty, but with a lot more laughs than either of those dramedies.I've never felt too strongly one way or another about Hugh Grant, but he is spot-on perfect in this film as a rich bachelor who lives off his father's money and doesn't have a care in the world. He prides himself on living a life of luxury and comfort, and avoiding complicated relationships. Cleary one of his best performances, Grant's interpretation of Will is shallow and cynical but layered with potential. By chance, he enters the life of a depressed single mother (Toni Collette) and her 12 year old son (Nicholas Hoult) who is in desperate need of some type of a male role model. There's a lot going on and several different sub-plots but essentially events unfold that further entangle Will into these people's lives. And ultimately he must decide if he is going to withdraw to his posh apartment and stay disconnected from people, or face the music and accept that truly no man is an island.Nicholas Hoult also gives a very strong performance for a first time actor. This is one of those films where every actor seems to be the ideal choice for the character they play, right down to the smallest roles. The moments of hilarious comedy are nicely balanced with a serious, at times melancholy, story. I'm sure there are some deep lessons here about how families can be created in all kinds of different circumstances, and are not always defined by bloodlines alone. Or about maturity, growing up, and finding meaning in life. All of that is probably true, but at the end of the day About a Boy is just a very enjoyable, funny movie that is well worth an hour and a half. An awesome soundtrack too makes this a must see film.

First of all, I was very much like Marcus when I was 12. Picked on all the time, son of a single mother, stood out more than I wanted to (which wasn't at all).And if I had the money, I would be very much like Will. Maybe not as shallow, but you never know.On the technical side, this movie was very well done. Hugh Grant can act, and can act very well. The kid who played Marcus was awesome. The supporting characters don't just come in when the story demands it, but they exist out of the frame too. You believe that these people have lives outside of what we see.I think what I liked best was that Will (Hugh Grant) isn't a charictiture of the 'shallow/loner' guy. His character changes subtly. Hugh Grant plays him very balanced. You know that there is something deeper that he just isn't showing us.Nicholas Hoult's work as Marcus is also very well done. He doesn't play Marcus as just a cute kid. He plays him as a real kid. I can see Nicholas actually being like this off set. One scene that sticks out in my mind is when he's sitting in class, thinking about the song 'Rainy days and Mondays' and starts to sing it out loud, oblivious to the fact that he's in class. I can't speak for everyone, but I for one know that I have done this. I connected with this character. I believe that Marcus is real, and his problems are real.See this film. It's not laugh out loud funny, but it's honest. If you want an intelligent movie to watch on a rainy day (or Monday), enjoy this one.

It's a pretty flimsy story about a guy who is basically happy.  Which is the first point of criticism  movies about happy people are mostly boring.  So, the script writer must have thought, let's start with a happy guy and make him unhappy. As the movie progresses the basic philosophy of the movie becomes clearer  the only way to happiness is by becoming the most average and mainstream character you can imagine.  Eccentric is wrong ! Mediocre is the highest good !  Because the main personage is happy being eccentric he has to be made aware of the fact that is actually unhappy because he is not like everyone else.  By the end he becomes like anyone else you've ever met and passed on the street and THUS must be happy. Very strange philosophy... One word about the young Nicholas Hoult  his character Marcus says he's not as good as Haley Joel Osmond and therefor has to go to school.  He's right about that alright.  I couldn't help but noticing that as the movie progresses the acting style of Nicholas starts to resemble mr. Grants' more and more.

Hugh Grant plays his usual self-effacing character. As the protagonist, he has been cast as a non-entity who only becomes somebody after prolonged exposure to a well-meaning twelve-year old whose mom has tried to commit suicide. Weitz brothers Chris and Paul, who helmed both American Pie and Down To Earth, directed this wholesome but hilarious epic about how British people who help people triumph over their problems. The premise that a youngster can draw an older, solitary loner out of his hermetically sealed bachelorhood provides a refreshing change of pace. Grant's character has been spared from the burden of toiling for a living because his late father penned one song, Santa's Super Sleigh, that emerges as a chartbuster. Actually, Will Freeman (Hugh Grant)abhors the song, but lives off the royalties of his father one-hit wonder tune. Meantime, life for Fiona Brewer (Toni Collette of Hitchcock) has not been rewarding. She earns her living as a music therapist who helps sick children. Lately, however, she has been plagued with worrisome thoughts that prompt her cry rivers of tears. She sends her son, Marcus (Nicholas Hoult of Warm Bodies), to school one morning and reminds him that she loves him. The entire playground ridicules this endearing exchange and Marcus hears everybody utter derisive variations of I love you, Marcus. Marcus knows about the third degree because everybody at school gives him grief. He even gives himself grief when he witlessly warbles songs in class without realizing that he is singing.Will is shocked and astonished that his closest friends ask him if he'd serve as their daughter's godfather. He refuses to capitalize on this this grand opportunity. I couldn't possibly think of a worse godfather for Imogene. You know me. I'll drop her at her christening. I'll forget her birthdays until her 18th, when I'll take her out and get her drunk and possibly, let's face it, you know, try and shag her. I mean, seriously, it's a very, very bad choice. Husband and wife John (Nicholas Hutchison of Miss Potter) and Christine (Sharon Small of Driven) react with surprise at Will's less than subtle response. Nevertheless, they set him up on a date with a friend, Ellie (Natalia Tena of Womb) who has a child. Usually, Will displays little tolerance for children as he emphasized when John and Christine sought to recruit him as a godparent. Suddenly, he performs an about-face attitude reversal and professes no qualms about dating a single mom. He hits it off well with Ellie. However, she decides she cannot continue their relationship and breaks up with him. The idea of dating single mothers obsesses Will. He attends a SPAT meeting; SPAT stands for Single Parents Alone Together. Predictably, Will is the only guy in the group and listens to their depressing stories of betrayal. When it comes time for him to contribute, Will makes up a story that his wife abandoned him and their two-year old son, Ned, and ran off with his best friend. Later, Will lands a date with Suzie (Victoria Smurfit of Bulletproof Monk), who also a SPAT member, and they along well enough. When they go out of a date, Suzie brings along Marcus because Fiona cannot accompany them. During the date, Marcus throws bits of his mom's bread at the ducks in the park pond. Frustrated with trying to pluck off pieces, Marcus hurls the entire loaf into the pond. Accidentally, he hits a duck with the bread and the blow kills it. Surprisingly, this scene turns out to be very humorous. Will convinces the park warden that Marcus hurled the loaf to see if he could sink the dead duck.After the date, when Suzie and Will take Marcus home, they discover Fiona has attempted to kill herself with pills. Eventually, the lonely Marcus becomes friends with Will and Will comes to regard him as more than an obnoxious brat. Initially, Marcus wants to visit Will and watch television with him or he will inform everybody that Will doesn't have a toddler. Later, a recovered Fiona confronts Will in a posh restaurant and demands to know what he has been doing with Marcus. Will defends his actions and points out to Fiona that her son is being bullying in school. Fiona breaks down later and admits that she isn't a very competent parent. By all indications, it appears that Will and Fiona will become a couple. Happily, the Weitz brothers deviate from this thinking. Will winds up meeting another woman, Rachel (Rachel Weisz of The Mummy), and they become enamored of each other. Rachel also has a son who attends Marcus' school. He is one of the students who torments Marcus. Inevitably, Will's lies get into hot water with Rachel when she learns that Marcus isn't Will's son. Apparently, their romance is heading for disaster, but things work out before fade-out.About a Boy is based on Nick Hornsby's novel. Grant imparts all his charisma and Collette plays the mousey mom who lives a depressing life. Scenarist Peter Hedges and the Weitzs have written some memorable dialogue and some of our heroe's observations under his breath about junctures in his life are clever. Mind you, this is a happily ever after opus, but Will and Fiona aren't the couple at fade-out. The finale in the school auditorium where Will accompanies Marcus on a guitar while sings a Roberta Flack tune is fun.

This movie had heaps of praise, and now I see why! It's perceptively funny and refreshingly sincere in its approach. Movies like this are why I still believe in the magic of movie making. About a Boy could have easily gone the pretentious route, but it strayed away from it completely. It takes a considerable amount of skill to make a pathetic womanizer like Will (Hugh Grant) as likable as he was, and also a lot of charisma on Hugh Grant's part. It shows you how stale life manages to get sometimes, and how nothing can seem to get you out of that funk, and all it takes is finding treasure in the strangest of places. Grant and Nicholas Hoult's chemistry is uncannily good. It was an absolute joy to watch them evolve together and balance each other out; I thank you gentlemen. Both are fantastic. He may be grown up now, but I dare you to find a child that can pull off a performance like Hoult did. You won't find many. Toni Collette is excellent as the suicidal mother with a heart of gold. Her actions are questionable, but her heart is there. She is very vital to this film's success. Any complaints? Not really. The finale got a wee bit silly for my liking, but it was so charming with the way it was done, I really didn't care. It had heart and that's all I cared about in the long run.

It's a low key narrative where a boy has to deal with some realities of life he's not ready for, and where a man is confronted by reality and must connect with it.Hugh Grant, as usual, has its way with words, but his volume is pretty moderate this time around. Opposite him is Nicholas Hoult as the boy. Their character are very disparate if not entirely opposite, and they play this duality pretty well, one strengthening and helping the other finding some basic truths of life.All the acting is solid, to the point where you want to slap some sense into Toni Collette's depressive persona. The editing gives us a great pacing, and the story is engrossing and, even if it stays pretty simple, brings a couple of new things to the table, as well as some well worn out ideas. The lie makes an apparition, but is dealt with in an incredibly mature way.

About a boy is an adaptation of the 1998 novel of the same name by Nick Hornby. Nick who is author of other film adaptations like Fever Pitch in 2005 and High Fidelity in 2000, allowed Hedges and the brother to work on the screenplay by themselves since the only film adaptation he worked on the screenplay is the 1997 British adaptation of Fever Pitch, which starred Colin Firth.About a boy is about Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) who lives a very carefree comfortable life in London, where Will doesn't work thanks to overly sufficient royalties left to him by his father from a successful Christmas song that his father composed. Due to this Will has enough time to meet women and has random sexual relationships with practically every woman he meets.Will soon discovered that single mothers are the easiest to get in bed, so he tried to nab as much as he can, his quest led him to meet Suzie and his dying need to get her in bed led him to meet Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), who is a 12 year old son of Suzie's friend, Fiona (Toni Collette). A weird relationship developed between the two in a mentor and mentee kind of way, that made Will have more of a apart in Marcus life than he planned to.About a boy was a commercial success, making over 130 million dollars in the box office which is almost 7 times its production cost. The movie itself was a critical acclaim, with the AFI (American Film Institute) naming it one of the best as one of the ten best movies of the year 2002 and it holds a 93% approval rating on the critic aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes.About a boy also got an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. Hugh Grant was also nominated for a Golden Globe award. Although Grant didn't win any notable awards he did win some not so notable ones including the Golden Camera (Goldene Kamera is an annual German film and television award, awarded by the television magazine HÖRZU.) award for Best International Actor.About a boy is just sweet and lovable and it will make you smile and it is a nice DVD to own.www.lagsreviews.com "},{"Title":"i don't like these sort of films but...","Date":"29 August 2012","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" This has to be the best drama film i have seen the film is about a singleton called will who lives freely without a responsibilities but meets a kid called marcus who he takes pity on.

But during one of his more dubious scams to date single mothers, he is forced to reconsider his moral fibre after coming into contact with a 12 year old outcast named Marcus.Adapted from the massively popular book written by Nick Hornby Fever Pitch & High Fidelity About A Boy easily translates well to the screen without truly breaking free of the modest premise. Oddly enough for such a British picture, this is directed by an American, Paul Weitz, who along with his brother Chris, brought the world American Pie!. It works, largely to the undervalued comic talents of one Hugh Grant Will. I would go so far as to say that without Grant leading the film, this would have been a flop, all the highlights on offer are when Grant is on the screen. Expressive with his face and delivering his lines with a natural high, Grant nicely lures the audience into the less than admirable Will's hands. Which is quite a trick considering that Will is a morally dubious scum bag!.Nicholas Hoult Marcus is OK as child actors go, but here he is given far to much to do. Which is another reason why Grant is so important to the film being a success, he shoulders much of the emotional burden, letting Hoult breathe what life he can into poor young Marcus worst hair cut on film ever. Solid support comes from Toni Collette and Rachael Weisz, and Weitz's direction is smooth and unobtrusive, with Badly Drawn Boy's score an integral part of the story. Yet as much as i enjoy the film myself, i still feel frustrated that it didn't turn out better than it did. A double handed narration from both lead characters intrudes on the flow of the plot, and the pay off is ultimately an oh moment.

But then I saw that it was based on a novel by Nick Hornby, who wrote the novel High Fidelity, upon which the movie by the same name is based and I liked High Fidelity plenty, especially considering that it's a romantic comedy. So I let down my guard.And I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't just another run-of-the-mill story, but rather, it was about... a boy. And a man. Or is the man a boy? No science fiction here, it's just a story about a older man learning what it means to be a human being through an expected mentor/friend relationship with a kid 1/3 his age. The characters are interesting and developed, even if the story is as clear as plastic wrap and the plotting obvious. But I like the story anyway, even if during the film, I still had doubts now and again.I did have one little qualm with the film, and that is that it's directed like every mainstream British comedy that I've seen, complete with the sad-montage sequence with some pop tune coursing through the film. But at least the characters were so well done, it didn't bother me too much that the film didn't really have much of a personality, at least artistically.So, it's essentially, a nice very straightforward story, with well developed characters and a very predictable (almost boring) style.

Very good to see a film where there are no AK47's stuttering, no foul language (well, only a couple of times) and no screaming and shouting and overacting to hype up the viewers. Marcus, the boy, was believable and worked well with Grant. The Brits still, in my opinion, make the most watchable films. They are truer to life. The women were attractive and did not look as though a plastic surgeon had tried to change them into some display dummy. Any age group could watch this and enjoy it. There is no sex for the voyeurs, and no violence for the sadists. (What a pity for them.) The acting was first class, the storyline was gentle and amusing, no mistakes in casting, many subtle satiric scenes and an appropriate setting made this an enjoyable film.

I can't remember what the other movie was, but I remember About a boy. It was surprisingly fantastic. It had a very suiting soundtrack and a good plot. It was quite heavy in narration, which is usually a bad sign, but it was done masterfully. The narration did an excellent job of supporting the flow of the film, kept it very real, and added a great deal to the humor. A great blend of drama and humor that quickly became one of my favorite films. About a Boy is a movie I think you could be surprised by.

In particular, Marcus's mother, who is clinically depressed, is presented correctly as emotionally numb and pretty much oblivious to those around her. This is quite different from the usual (erroneous) Hollywood version of effusive, and usually loquacious, sadness. Even the boy, who is the real hero of the story, is allowed to be not-all-that-likable. Beyond the movie itself, I really enjoyed the interview with High Grant that was included on the DVD. He was honest enough to admit that he genuinely does not much care for children, and so the discomfort and emotional distance between Will and Marcus is not fake. I think he mentioned insisting that they not cast a kid who was going to want to hug him or something similar, and that comes across clearly in the film, adding to rather than detracting from the texture of the story.

Presumably, men like his stories because they see guys screwing up in ways they wish they could. And women seem to go for them because they love the man-child idea&#151;up to a point that is, because Hornby always sees to it that his hero's m.o. backfires, shoving him into adulthood and, as a bonus, shaping him into a sensitive human being. Such was the fate of John Cusack's Rob Gordon in High Fidelity (2000), the first hit movie based on a Hornby bestseller, and so it goes for Hugh Grant's Will in this Hornby adaptation. Will is a cad who, in order to meet women, fakes his way into a single parents support group. The plot banks a couple hairpin turns to introduce a despondent mother (Toni Collette) and her wise-beyond-his-years son (Nicholas Hoult). The two guys&#151;the man-child and the child-man&#151;buddy up and, after another tumble of events, the kid beards as the man's son so Will can seduce another woman (Rachel Weisz). Deception in close quarters and its ensuing complications have always been fundamental to romantic comedy. It's the single common factor running through the best-in-class list Trouble in Paradise, It Happened One Night, My Man Godfrey, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, Nothing Sacred, Easy Living, Bringing Up Baby, The Shop Around the Corner, The Philadelphia Story, His Girl Friday, The Lady Eve, The Palm Beach Story, The More the Merrier, Sullivan's Travels, The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, Born Yesterday, Roman Holiday, Pillow Talk, Some Like It Hot, The Apartment, Breakfast at Tiffany's, Georgy Girl, The Graduate, Shampoo, Tootsie, Prizzi's Honor, Moonstruck, Bull Durham, Flirting with Disaster, and There's Something About Mary. Each of these pictures, though, wastes little time introducing their characters or setting up their premises in order kick off the comedy. That one (or both) of the lovers has something to hide is a generic given. What makes them funny is how ingeniously they juggle their circumstances and how, as the lies pile up, they put themselves at greater risk. About a Boy misses this point completely. It drags us through the set-up step by step&#151;there's not a blithe bone in its body. And, just to make things worse, the child keeps dropping nuggets of wisdom and few, if any, things can be more annoying to watch than a killjoy kid doling out life lessons to stupid adults. (Didn't anybody on this movie suffer through Jerry Maguire?)Grant turns in his standard dithering, non-plussed performance; sometimes it's hard to discern if it's Will or Hugh who's confused about the situation he's in. He seems smaller than usual here, too, a pinball careering off the plot's bumpers and pitfalls. Every time he takes on one of these piffling roles, some critic gets beside himself and compares him to Cary Grant. The stretch could not be wider, however. Cary was always a man caught in situations that forced him to behave childishly. Hugh is our Tony Curtis&#151;he's only charming when he's trying to catch up with the adults (who often don't even try to conceal their condescension toward him). Stuck as we are with morons (Jim Carrey, Owen Wilson) and schmucks (Ben Stiller, Adam Sandler) dominating our romantic comedies, Grant is always a welcome change. About a Boy's agenda, though, is lining things up so Will/Grant will learn how to act his age. In the process, it turns its typically nimble, engaging star into a thumping bore.

So he must know a few things about living life as a fake.While a fine writer, able to write well about small things, he is also light and throwaway. More like superior journalism than great novel writing, although always entertaining and down-to-earth.Grant can't really act, merely do variations on himself. Here he is a bit more like the real person, no stumbling and bumbling and tripping over his own feet, but somewhat languid. While pleasant company he makes a lot of his nice face, foppish hair (here cut short and spiky) and upper class accent.(Most English actors have come from the stage and have a range of tricks while Grant has - somehow - grown up on film. Nearly always cast as himself.) This is a film of small jokes and situation comedy. Running gags about the one song from which he lives (Santa's Magic Slay) and the empty tedium of his life abound, but I don't believe him. People don't volunteer to tell other people that they do nothing, they create professions (such as investor) which they don't spend many hours doing. Equally the idle rich are not islands, they hang around with other members of the idle rich.The film tries to not to go down the road of the obvious, the child who he befriends (or more accurately befriends him) is ordinary. If this was an American film the kid would be blonde haired and blue eyed, not so here. Naturally we are on a journey, if only towards fashion headgear and a better haircut.Where is the Grant character on a journey to? That there is a life beyond daytime TV? Did he need to meet a child to learn that? Surely not. And where does the character go after this film ends? A slightly modified version of the same? The film goes beyond the book in having a school concert in which Grant tries to save the day. Is this the best they could come up with? Character pieces are hard to end, but this is just an unpleasant pile-on-the-agony experience for everyone. Overall, hard to dislike this film because everyone is working hard (and the music - from Badly Drawn Boy - is good too), but the sights are so low that it is barely a TV movie and I am not surprised they are making this in to a TV series. There is a lots of little jokes that could be rung and so many extra avenues they could wander down...

A whole lot it seems. The two main characters Will (played by a Hugh Grant at his best) and Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) could not be more different Will is a stylish, wealthy single in his thirties, who has never worked a single day and considers dating women his only purpose in his life. Marcus is a twelve year old vegetarian, who grows up with a single hippie mother and is constantly being teased by the other kids at school for being different. To Will's horror, their lives inevitably get entangled more and more from the moment they meet for the first time. Although Hornby recycles some of the ideas that made `High fidelity' so enjoyable to read and watch it is impossible for the viewer to predict the outcome of the fateful day when Marcus unintentionally kills a duck at the park while his mother, who is suffering from depression, tries to commit suicide. Had the directors refused the temptation to add the kitschy scene when Will rescues Marcus' embarrassing stage appearance at the school concert (which is not in the book), the film would bear no Hollywood clichés at all. All characters are perfectly credible and Hugh Grant manages to play his role without resemblance to the stereotypes he is so well known for. His performance is proof that it can be very hard to play light comedy with wit and charm and he handles the task perfectly. Young Nicholas Hoult also starrs brilliantly without making the mistake of depicting Marcus all too likeable. Although not as hilarious as the book, the film gets my recommendation for being a fine, unconventional satire. Self-centered singles should be warned though This film is not only very entertaining, it could also shake your principles.  "},{"Title":"This website was very useful.

But, being a manly man, he does want to connect with members of the female population, from time to time. For goodness sake, though, no one ever better mention the word marriage in his presence! When some friends fix him up with a single mother, Will discovers a goldmine, or so he thinks. Single mothers are more concerned about their children and are more wary about making commitments, which is good news indeed for Will. Learning about a meeting for parents without partners, Will goes off eagerly to the affair, hoping to scope out some nice Bettys. But, unexpectedly, he makes the acquaintance of a single mother, Fiona (Toni Collette) and her somewhat nerdy son, Marcus. By some strange inner intuition, Marcus sees Will as a mate and begins coming over to Will's apartment, spending serious time with the consummate bachelor. But, is Will just pretending to be nice to an equally lonesome young man? This is an outstanding movie, with superb laughs and superb messages. No one could have played the part of Will as Grant does, with great humor and feeling. It is Grant's finest hour, absolutely. Similarly, the rest of the cast, including Rachel Weisz, is very nice indeed. The production looks swell, with lovely costumes, great London scenery, and beautiful cinematography. Nevertheless, it is the story and script that is most outstanding in accounting for the film's greatness. In fact, you would be hardpressed to find a movie that delivers such big laughs AND such important messages as this one does.

Also, if you ask me, despite the fact that we wasn't like everybody else, to me, Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) was a kind boy with a good heart. I felt really sorry for him when he was teased and tormented at school. In my opinion, the performances were top grade, the direction was superior, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the cast was perfectly chosen. Also, the soundtrack is really good, too.

A great comedy.","Date":"5 September 2005","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" After going through a summer with varying degrees of crappy movies I decided to hit up this film which I haven't seen in a while. I realized I was watching nothing short of magic. This is a romantic comedy with a true heart and it knows how to tug at it. Hugh Grant gives a brilliant performance as Will, a rich bachelor who befriends a young boy who is having parental issues much to his dismay. But he actually grows attached to this child. The story is a bit predictable but it is the relationship that this man and boy share that is captivating. Once you start this film you become engrossed in it. The film is genuinely funny and insanely sweet. This is a film not to be missed especially when you have re-hashed rubbish being recycled over and over again. It is a true breath of fresh air.

I was so wrong! About a Boy is an excellent film, definitely in my top five of 2002 and even more, it is in my all-time top ten. First of all it's really hard to decide what genre exactly is this film. At first sight it look more like romance comedy but after you have watched it more carefully and more than once it become obviously that About a Boy is an intelligent inspiring drama. This film is a very rare case when some comedy elements incredibly well harmonize with more important and complicated elements of drama. There are many reasons for considering this film as a masterpiece. First of all it's the script. At first it's in many parts different from the Nick Hornby's book, so some people who love the book can be disappointed, though screenwriters despite all changes were able to catch the book's atmosphere. So the story is a bit simpler and at the same time more positive than in the book. It contains lots of wit, heart and believability. This is a story about two leading characters Will and Marcus. Will (Hugh Grant character) is a 38 years old single man. His father years ago wrote a famous Christmas song and after his death Will has received the author's rights for the song and continually gets the money from them. He has never been working more than month or two in a row and his lifestyle is very simple. First every man is an island. And the second I don't care about others and no one cares about me. He spends all of his time watching TV, shopping CD and other things, stylizing his hair and dating with his girlfriends. After one of his dates he invents a new idea about dating single mothers and taking off before their relations become too serious. That seems perfect to him but when he meets 12 years old Marcus his life begin to change. I think Hugh Grant was an ideal choice for Will (in my opinion it's his best performance so far). He is always very good as a comedy actor and in About a Boy he proves his acting ability not only as a shallow comedy star. Will character could have been at least unpleasant and it is only bright charming Hugh Grant performance give us the impression that Will not as bad as he looks. There are also many minor, almost unnoticeable details which confirm such impression. Marcus is a 12 years old, smart and sensitive but gawky boy, who lives with his depressed mother Fiona (Toni Collette), perfectly played by a new rising star Nicholas Hoult. Nicholas Hoult is brilliant as Marcus. His acting is so powerful and emotional that it's impossible to look at his character without strong sympathy. Marcus easily became outcast in the school and in the whole society. He seeks a kind of refuge in Will house and while they spend time together Will learns new things about himself and take some life lessons. Will's evolution and awakening from a selfish idler to a really warm and likable character is perfectly shown through this film. These two main characters are so real that it's easy for many people to find some similarities with them. The good point is that the story never becomes predictable even for people who have read the book. Though the dialogs in the movie are quite different from the book, they are well written, funny and memorable. The music written by Badly Drawn Boy (absolutely new name for me) is quite suitable and original. It supplies some additional charms to the story. And about the comedy parts. I must say that I can't remember another film when such strong and touching drama makes you smile and laugh so many times. This film is very heartfelt and it carries lots of inspiring and smart messages. In the conclusion About a Boy is an excellent, entertained and enjoyable film, which deserves to be taken more serious than most of people did. Could this movie have been better? In conditions of such changed script that seems unlikely to me. So it's not quite a perfect adaptation of one of my favorite books but nevertheless as a movie it's almost perfect masterpiece.10 out of 10 or solid A (one of the best of the year). Sorry for my bad English.

The book's structure involves some obviously cinematic elements, so the filmmakers had the screenplay lying practically finished before them.Still, they managed to mess it up. Chris and Paul Weitz were a tiny bit too ambitious in making the film their own work. They left out character elements that are absolutely central in the book (like Marcus's childlike lack of sarcasm) &#150; which, of course, is perfectly allowed in a film but still a pity. They cut out important scenes because they found them boring, which is why audiences who do not know the book are completely over-taxed by the mass of characters that are introduced and cleared out again within a few scenes (like Clive, Marcus's father, or Ellie, his first love).Finally, they changed the last third, including, of course, the ending of the story. They did it, I suspect, only because they didn't want to play the film in the present and not in the middle of the 1990s, so they would have had to either distort history or leave out the entire Kurt Cobain story. So they were forced to invent a completely new ending. I do not think that the plots of books are sacrileges (on the contrary I think they needn't be more than a matter of inspiration for the screenplays based upon them) but the ending they made up in this case, simply destroyed the whole story. It made it sentimental (not very sentimental but too sentimental), stale and abrupt. Whenever a filmmaker chooses to make major changes in a plot previously published, they must re-imagine the entire plot, otherwise the whole movie usually becomes a mess.The book About a Boy fascinated me partly because it was funny and sad at the same time. The film About a Boy is either funny only or neither. What a pity.

He learns more than he signed up for as he learns what life and love is truly about. I think every guy should watch this film as it encapsulates what our approach to life can so often turn into and hopefully will cause many to stop and think, is this really what my POV of life should be.

We are able feel Will's progress from a completely hopeless eternal child, to the man who finally decided to participate in the life around him. Markus is a compelling portrait of all of us at some point in life, when we were so lost that, not only we did not have the answers, but we were not even aware of the issues.

"},{"Title":"Even Faith-based crowd will like this","Date":"9 March 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" As far as Will Freeman (Grant) is concerned, he has the perfect life; he lives comfortably, if not extravagantly, on the income provided by a certain kind of inheritance. On the surface, at least, he's happy. Admittedly, however, he's the very epitome of 'shallow,' who makes a conscious and concerted effort at avoiding any commitment in relationships, or even attempting to accomplish or achieve anything at all. He merely takes from life, gives absolutely nothing back and has always been content with it. But of late, his relationships have become a bit 'sticky.' Women are becoming too demanding, the break-ups too messy. He needs a new conquest, a relationship in which he can flex his shallowness anew, with a woman who will give him everything and demand nothing in return.Fortuitous circumstances provide him with just what he's looking for; fortuitous, however, in a way he doesn't realize, as it leads to a relationship through which he encounters a young boy, Marcus (Nicholas Hoult). And it's a meeting that is destined to have an enormous impact on his life, as Marcus becomes the catalyst that changes Will's entire perspective. For the first time, Will begins to question who he is, and what he's doing-- or not doing-- with his life.Telling this story (adapted for the screen by Peter Hedges and the Weitz brothers, from the novel by Nick Hornby) presented a challenge to the filmmakers, in that it's nothing really new; the history of the cinema is filled with stories of individual epiphanies, many along the same lines as this one (recently, 'The Kid,' with Bruce Willis, for example). So a fresh approach and presentation, including the kind of performances they could extract from their actors, was essential for this film to attain any distinction whatsoever. Which it does, and splendidly. And, moreover, they succeed on all fronts. The screenplay is intelligent, and the characters-- especially Will and Marcus' mom, Fiona (Toni Collette)-- are convincingly well developed. With Will, there is no sudden leap into who he becomes by the end of the film; it comes though a gradual recognition and realization of who he is, after first establishing a starting point from which the character can grow. The same is true of Fiona. There's detours and set-backs which-- as in real life-- prevent a direct journey from point A to point B, and create the proverbial sticky wicket along the way. Weitz and Weitz set a good pace, and most importantly, manage to give their film some real heart without lapsing into any melodramatic, maudlin sentimentality. Rather, the sentiments and situations they express are real and believable, and presented in such a way as to afford the audience any number of elements to which they can genuinely relate.As Will, Hugh Grant gives arguably his best performance ever. In some respects, Will is similar to other characters Grant has created (most notably Daniel in 'Bridget Jones's Diary'), but there's a depth to Will he's never previously managed to achieve, and without question this is his most three-dimensional, fully developed character yet. Grant has a natural charm and a charismatic screen presence, but his presentation is often tinged with a bit of pretentiousness that is entirely absent here. He does an especially nice job of effecting Will's transition in very real and credible terms, and by the end, it's obvious that this is a side of Grant we have not seen before; with this role, he has effectively expanded his range as an actor. In the final analysis, it's a performance with real substance, and it makes Will a truly memorable character.

After all these years, I end up seeing the film two days. This was definitely not the wait and I don't believe on how long I actually had to wait to see this film. This is one of the most marvelous comedy dramas I have ever seen in such a long time.The story follows a lonesome young man who doesn't have a job, stays home and watches TV all day and basically chills out. It's not until he joins a single parents group and then meets little Marcus that his life slowly starts to change into something that he has never experienced before. This boy teaches him how to be a mature being.I really enjoyed everything about this intriguing film. By the ending title credits, I was totally hooked and my eyes never took away from the screen. The actors were beautifully produced and developed, the story is an excellent scent to get into and there are many comedic scenes which will have you laughing.Hugh Grant is obviously the main star of this film and for good reason. He does an excellent job of adapting this role of Will, the selfish but isolated man who just wants to be left alone, and wants to live his life alone. I really had sympathy for the character because I knew what he was going through. I'm sure everyone in real life has experienced some of the traumas that the Will Character goes through. You really love him even if he can get picky in many areas. I could really relate to him myself in some ways. Hugh Grant of course brings this character to life. It's not only with the character's mood and the atmosphere of him but it's the comic relief and comedic dialogue which makes him come to life fully.The boy who plays as the young, lost little soul Marcus, was also quite a powerful figure throughout this film. We too also feel sorry for him as he has a hard time living at home, getting bullied and only having Will to look up to. Even though he is harmless in every way possible, it doesn't stop him from wanting to help Will in the best way possible to succeed and not be held back by isolation. The boy too doesn't have any friends and is treated badly but Will seems to be a build up of an excellence for him. The two have each other to bounce off of. But it is the boy which works on Will more with emotions and life itself because the boy helps Will to change his view on life. Will alter realizes that Marcus is the only person he has really gottan to love. This creates a semi-father son hood. It also has many funny results as some things don't go the way Will plans it.The back up actors and sound track score are also an excellent back up throughout.

The film stars Hugh Grant as Will, Nicholas Hoult as Marcus,Toni Collette as Fiona, and Rachel Weisz as Rachel. The movie at times uses double voice-over narration, where the audience hears both Will's and Marcus's thoughts.It was written and directed by brothers Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz and it was co-written by What's Eating Gilbert Grape creator Peter Hedges.which based on the novel of the same name by Nick Hornby.About a Boy concerns the parallel stories of the thirty-something Will, a layabout serial nice guy living a posh, carefree lifestyle off his deceased father's fortune; and the preteen Marcus,a bright but awkward youth who's tired of his mom Fiona's depressed, boyfriend-less state. Their paths collide when Will, deciding that single mothers are the easiest romantic conquests on the dating scene, fabricates a two-year- old son and joins a group called S.P.A.T. (Single Parents Alone Together). Marcus is wise to Will's scheme, however, and through some incessant pestering and blackmail, he contrives for Will to date Fiona. Though Will doesn't hit it off immediately with either Marcus or his mother, he gradually begins to open up to the people around him -- so much so that he attracts the attention of another attractive single mom.About a Boy is excellent in the sense that it present a coming-of-age stories of a young immature man and a young bright boy through their awkward relationship.This dramedy is fresh and original as it was neither predictable nor formulaic from beginning to end unlike most comedic features.It also uses subtlety in presenting its theme and messages especially about romantic relationships,maturity and one's search for identity in life.Finally,it maximizes Hugh Grant's boyish charisma to the fullest.

It's interesting but that feeling hasn't changed at all.The film is about a vain, shallow, selfish man in his late 30's called will finding friendship with a shy, awkward and endearing 12 year old boy called Marcus. Together in their friendship they help each other find solutions to each others problems. And although it may sound cheesy to most, it really isn't. The movie is a timelessly heartwarming, feel good movie but it is also very funny. Some scenes will make you laugh endlessly.Will is a character who needs to learn to grow up fast. He's never had a job, has no girlfriend and he spends his days buying things. Hugh Grant was the perfect choice for the character. He has this ability of making a character who may come across unlikeable and making him likable. He is very funny in this; his character has some of the funniest quotes in the movie. It's impossible to hate him, he is charming and you can relate to his character.Although i like will and Hugh in the film, Marcus and Nicholas stood out for me throughout the whole film. Marcus is a kid who has too much to deal with in his life, but deals with it with maturity beyond his years. He has no friends, is bullied at school and goes home to a depressed single mum although he is a kind, sensitive and a little awkward he is without a doubt lovable. Nicholas Hoult is absolutely astounding. There's a scene near the end where you feel his nerves. It's a scene where Marcus sings at a school concert despite hating standing up in front of people, because he wants to make his mum feel better by singing her favourite song killing me softly. As Marcus stands alone performing to the heckling crowd of his peers he shows so much vulnerability and bravery. And Nicholas Hoult conveys this feeling, he makes you connect with Marcus and you forget you are watching a movie because you want to go up and protect him from the crowd because the emotions and the characters are so realistic to you. This performance shows just why Nicholas Hoult is one of if not the best upcoming actors of his generation. I cant wait to see his future movies, he is a natural.The supporting cast is brilliant also. They all play their parts wonderfully. The directors did a marvellous job at making this film. I hadn't really seen any of their work, but I want to see more of their work now.And I cannot leave this review without mentioning the amazing soundtrack. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing by Badly Drawn Boy. The songs are all poignant to what is on screen and the songs are wonderful.If you haven't seen this film, or loved it and want to watch it again, then I urge you to go and watch it. It is an amazing film that will make you laugh and at times cry. And its amazing that i still feel this way even 10 years on from seeing it originally.Absolutely Timeless.10/10 for me.

Firstly, we have the book which is written by Nick Hornby who we know from his other novels like High Fidelity. The book version of About a Boy is a nice written novel which is really nice and fast to read. The writing style of Hornby is very modern, into the face with nice descriptions of everything what's going on. The story isn't very exciting so it isn't a book you want to finish in one day, but it's certainly a book which is fun to read a couple of pages of before sleeping.The film is of course a lot shorter than the book so a lot of descriptions are a lot shorter than you will find in the book and there are also a lot less of them. But for the lazy people, the film will be more amusing than the book will. I'm one of those people who would prefer to watch the film, just because I prefer to watch to a story than to read a story.So decide for yourself what you prefer or maybe you want to read the book and watch the film but then I prefer to watch the film first, it helps a lot to visualize the scenes when your reading the book!

In the film, the story ends with the music contest at school. There is a kind of a happy ending in the film, while in the novel, the story ends less happy. In the novel, Will actually becomes a kind of a wretch, who doesn't want to lose his love.I prefer reading the novel rather than watching the movie. That's mostly because I can use my imagination while reading the book. I can't do that with the film; the film is already made in a certain way. If I had to choose which ending was better, I would choose the ending of the book, because I think that the ending of the book is more likely and more complex. In my opinion, the way the film ends is too happy.

In the main story it's the same, but the film had some happenings which the book did not have, so it wasn't exactly the same. The only thing I think it had to be mentioned in the film is the music of Curt Cobain and Snoop Dogg, because in the book it played a pretty big part, but in the film it was almost nothing. An other positive thing of the film was that the actors been chosen were very good. Especially Hugh Grant played the role of Will very well. What I most like about a filming is that you can see what a writer means with the characters, in a book you have to imagine what kind of people they are. I know some people think that's just the reason why a book is more fun, but if I have to imagine a whole story, it looks almost the same as other stories because I every time think about the same landscape with it. So I think the film is better than the novel.

The film is good, because there are subjects that are realistic. For example the mother of Marcus Fiona tries to commit suicide and Marcus is bullied on school. That subjects are realistic, because they often happen in real. But the book is realistic, too. In the film they don't talk too much about one subject.

Another thing that disappointed me was that in the movie there is no music from Kurt Cobain or Snoop Dogg. In the book this music plays a pretty big role in the development of the characters, but in the movie all of this music was gone.

I tried searching for good movies to watch and About a Boy was recommended more than two times. I decided to give it a try, but I wasn't really expecting anything. So basically, I started watching this movie with no expectations whatsoever. And I must say, WOW. I was blown away.This could easily be one of the best comedy flicks there are out there. The laughs I had during this movie were very numerous. The funniest scene for me was probably the first half of the Fiona-Will confrontation scene. But aside from the humor, the underlying family tones are also great.Will was sort of what you'd call a mild playboy. He wasn't as wild as Barney Stinson (HIMYM), but he does make up crazy stories to get accepted by girls that he likes. The scene where he tries picking up women in a Single Parents Alone Together club was funny. However in the end, he wizened up. He realized that there was more to life. He realized this with the help of a boy named Marcus.Marcus was a kid who kept on getting teased and bullied by his schoolmates. Aside from that, his mom, Fiona, was also problematic. Marcus seeks refuge from his world by spending time with Will who shows Marcus how to have fun. He is also a very brave kid. In one of the last scenes, where he sings in front of the whole school, that must have taken real guts. I was very impressed. But then again, it is a movie. I bet if that was real life and people were booing you off the stage, he'd burst into tears and beg his mom to let him transfer schools.Hearing Hugh Grant sing Killing Me Softly reminded me of his role in Music and Lyrics with Drew Barrymore when they sang Way Back into Love. Is it just me or does all movies where Grant features have a song solo? I think the main reason why I rated this movie so high was because I really liked seeing Marcus and Will's relationship develop. This movie isn't like your average movie where the boy falls in love with the girl and they live happily ever after and blah blah blah. Well, sure, Will falls in love with another woman, but the movie's focus wasn't on them. Majority of the movie focused on the boys' friendship and how other events affected them. That was a welcome change from all the same-plot romance movies we have now.I was expecting an average movie on a lazy, boring night, but what I got was so much more. Another favorite classic movie and high standards for other movies of the same genre. I think I'm going to read Nick Hornby's book now. I hope it doesn't disappoint and levels with the same brilliance that this movie exhibited.

Particular in a way that some might find it well written and interesting but also oppositely. The movie had a cliché ending, in a sense that it could be foretold very easily. People who you expect end up together and people who had problems solved them. Even the main character Will was a typical movie hotshot. He did however have a little more depth which improved the story line and overall insight of the movie. Marcus' mother had typical problems, and Marcus himself was the typical school outcast. Other things such as the typical music and lines make the film look like a chick-flick. Although I could not consider this a film masterpiece it was definitely very entertaining. It was very comical and had a interesting situations. One of the best aspects of this movie was probably the thought behind the story line, or the part of the movie that goes deeper than the plot. The relationships you learn between people and how it affects their lives, and how people get insights of face problems and deal with them. The film can also be very relatable, and we can apply the lessons we learn from the film to our own life.

After a successful fling with a single mother, Mr. Grant decides to set aside his disdain for children and court more lonely young mothers. He invents a son named Ned goes to an event for single parents. Already good-looking and well-heeled, Grant's invented fatherhood gives him the character needed to be a triple player. On a date, he meets geeky twelve-year-old Nicholas Hoult (as Marcus Brewer). Young Hoult needs a mate to help watch his mum, Toni Collette (as Fiona), who has an occasional tendency to sob and get suicidal. Grant isn't interested in shagging the kid's hippie mother, but is blackmailed into being a father-figure for Hoult, who has discovered Grant's secret (he has no kid). Eventually, Grant asks Hoult to pose as his son, hoping to score with comely Rachel Weisz (as Rachel). About a Boy is a pleasant surprise, mostly due to the casting of Hoult, a complete natural, in the pivotal role; he not the annoying movie star kid you're expecting. The film also flatters Grant and its cast, with only Ms. Collette's character being slightly underwritten - we aren't given enough information about her condition, but the actress and story suggest she's going to be okay in the long run. The two supporting youth roles, Natalia Tena and Augustus Prew, are also nicely played. All kidding asides &#x85; Paul and Chris Weitz were known more for producing the low-brow American Pie franchise &#x85; which had nothing to do with the 1972 American Pie hit single &#x85; but About a Boy very effectively uses the Roberta Flack classic Killing Me Softly with His Song &#x85; which was originally written about American Pie singer/songwriter Don McLean &#x85; and became a mega-cool hip-hop hit by The Fugees in 1996 ... connections which are not Badly Drawn, Boy &#x85; yes it was John Donne, not Bon Jovi, who said No man is an island &#x85; but Paul Kantner added He's a peninsula!The co-directing Weisz brothers, with writer Peter Hedges, do a beautiful job translating the Nick Hornby novel to cinema. It's nice to see filmmakers are still able to make refreshing changes to excellent source material. As the DVD describes, this is a lesson about life from a bright, but hopelessly geeky 12-year-old named Marcus taught to a smooth-talking bachelor whose primary goal in life is avoiding any kind of responsibility, with both boys benefiting in the end. ******** About a Boy (4/26/02) Paul & Chris Weitz ~ Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, Toni Collette, Rachel Weisz "},{"Title":"About a Boy and a Boy","Date":"5 August 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Hugh Grant shows just how winning he can be, and how he's managed such longevity in his career despite being a fairly limited actor, in this disarming and delightful film.With a title like About a Boy, you just know going in that there will be some question as to which boy we're talking about.

The proverbial happy bachelor who is set in his ways is bound to succumb to the temptations of togetherness and love as he does in every film. About a Boy does not defy this classic character profile, but neither does it slosh around in clichéd fashion. Hugh Grant's charms and his surrounding cast of unusuals played by fine actors add just enough color to Nick Hornby's touching family story to appear fresh and even revelatory.Grant plays Will, a ladies' man living off royalties from his father's one hit Christmas song who decides to up his game by pretending to be a single parent and going after lonely, confused single moms. This leads him by a stroke of fate to Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), a pre- pubescent boy whose mother attempts suicide their very first day acquainted with each other. Marcus has surprising amount of self-determination for his age and Hoult gives him maturity beyond his years. Before long (but not without some persistence from Marcus), the two form an odd friendship. Marcus needs a distraction from his emotionally shaky home life and Will find unintentionally that Marcus gives him some purpose and direction.The two will redefine relationships for anyone viewing this film. The proper classification for them would be ambiguous. Will is a father figure to Marcus, but he's also the closest thing Marcus has to a friend as the kids at school have shunned him socially because he's odd, small and breaks out into song unbeknownst to himself on occasion. That said, Will doesn't do any actual things for Marcus, but his presence and attention does wonders.Will's destiny is set from here on out. It's only a matter to what extent he will discover the need for human connection in life, or as Marcus puts in in voice over, having more than just one other person. The script poignantly explores the notion of fulfilling self needs versus fulfilling those of others, while also carefully pointing out that these needs are intricately interconnected.The film is an impressive departure for brothers Paul and Chris Weitz, who co-wrote The Nutty Professor II and directed American Pie. Teamed with What's Eating Gilbert Grape? scribe Peter Hedges, the adaptation takes shape nicely. Perhaps they're light on building Grant's character into a truly independent person, but it's easier to like him this way. Better he not be a jerk, which would hurt the plausibility of Marcus looking up to him.As is true of Hornby's work, music is central, and it's especially prominent in Boy. The key turning point revolved around a performance of Roberta Flack's Killing Me Softly and the soundtrack from Badly Drawn Boy creates a distinct mood. The power of song as self- expression is equally important, as music creates connections between people that are intangible.~Steven CVisit my site at http//moviemusereviews.com "},{"Title":"Sweet and well played comedy/drama...","Date":"26 February 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" 1st watched 2/23/2010 -- 7 out of 10(Dir-Paul & Chris Weitz) Sweet and well played comedy/drama with Hugh Grant as a bachelor who does nothing in his life but collect royalties from his father's one-hit-wonder song until a 12-year old boy comes into his world and changes him. The way the initial encounter happens is that Will(the character played by Grant)lies about having a son(twice in the movie)to attract single mom's and one of the mom's friends' son(who is the 12-year old mentioned earlier)joins them on a picnic. The boy, played by Nicholas Hault, kind of adopts him and forces himself into the man's life by coming over after school to hang out. They eventually get along but the boy's initial reason for the encounters is so that Will might take an interest in his mom(but that never happens). They teach other other a few things and eventually become attached to one another. Will, never expected this to happen -- since he of course is his own island. This is a simple movie that teaches us what is really important in life by presenting us someone who is unchangeable and then shows them changing. There are a few laughs in the movie, but the story of the boy and his relationship to his suicidal mother and how Will eventually becomes a part of their lives is what makes the movie special.

He discovers single mothers' potential as grist to his mill and proceeds to, mercilessly hump 'em and dump 'em in a most ungentlemanly manner until he crosses paths with Marcus, a needy but canny 12 year old.

Nonetheless it is - in my opinion - leaps and bounds above Mr Grant's usual metier and overall is a well - acted,intelligently scripted and thoroughly worthwhile experience.The music - by a person apparently called Badly-Drawn Boy of whom I had previously never heard - is excellent.

You may ask what makes About a Boy different from every other romance films. Why should you spend time watching a film that could easily be a repeat of another one of his flicks? With his roles in films such as Four Weddings and a Funeral and Love Actually, his characters were always chasing the girl but there is more to Will than these stereotypical parts. He is not Prince Charming. He is not a babbling geek. He is a git. A man with no regard for anything but himself. Grant has made Will the man any viewer would love to hate.But yet he manages to be unbelievably funny and charming, and you can't help but love him. Grant here has shed that everyday lovable loser who can't commit into a man with personal baggage and an agenda. Juxtaposed with Nicholas Holt and you have a fine on screen duo.Little would we know that the lad playing Malcolm would become a teenage hero in award winning teenage gritty drama Skins. This well thought out debut performance puts faith back into the future.The stereotypical geek protagonist is ridiculed too often by picking up on media conventions such as computers, glasses and vast knowledge etc. But there is a spin here because Malcolm is called a geek because of his appearance. The baggy hippy clothes, the bowl haircut and the solo singing make him an outcast and he is labelled a geek for it and here we explore the depths of his character and though he is portrayed as a geek on the outside he is a child wanting love on his inside, a fine representation. This sentimental technique which some may find obvious but undeniably rightful.Sounds cheesy right? Wrong. This Nick Hornby adaptation is far from it.

Naturally there's a boy in the film but of course, this being based on a book by Nick Hornby the principal male adult is nothing of the sort, being immature, clumsy and stunted - although very entertaining.Through a bizarre chicane of circumstances Hugh Grant's Will ends up befriending Nicholas Hoult's Marcus, a socially marginalised schoolboy who shares his disenfranchised fatalism. Both 'men' are staring down a very dilute existential issue the former, the trappings of his failure to grow up; the latter his mother's depression. Toni Colette is the prize turn as a neurotic, bohemian North London mum who, like her son and his friend, has lost sight of the plot. Grant gives his charming dope routine a bit of an edge and carries the film amiably; Hoult is also very good.

He is not actually a parent.Yet, even as he denies it, there is within him a longing to fill a shallowness which he calls comfort. The story develops around Will's growth as an adult, helped by a boy's plain-spoken natural wisdom. While the flick gets its laughs off the original premise, it develops into a feel-good light drama rather than a laugh-a-minute farce.The boy's mother, Fiona, is flawed-- suicidal in fact-- and generally unlikely material for a romantic lead. Yet, she upholds her dignity as an individual even while she is being torn down by self-destructiveness.Around 2/3rds through this film, it occurred to me that even Hollywood--so able to find humanity in the strangest places--might not in the materialistic America of the 2000's elevate Fiona, but that the UK remains after all a socialist country in which perhaps meaning can still survive despite poverty. For that matter, in the U.S. the film never would have gotten around a man privately associating with a young boy. This film is somewhat in the tradition of social realism. And so it is a well-made, funny but also soulful film.

Unfortunately, the word depression or illness is never used in the picture, so people watching it may not understand what her problem is.Hugh Grant plays yet another version of Hugh Grant (always dependable) and does a great job at one point of removing all signs of intelligence from his face and eyes -- truly going blank.This rom-com-drama is one of a long series from England (often starring Hugh Grant) beginning with Four Weddings & A Funeral, where personal relationships are placed in the greater context of family and friends. The core story is predictable, so you're left with the quirks to determine whether this will be memorable or not. About A Boy is memorable due to its handling of some of the more deep themes -- it doesn't get too maudlin and doesn't gloss over them too much, either. It allows the viewer to take it further if they want, but keeps it to a consistent degree of intensity for those who just want to see Grant be Grant.There are few surprises (though the ones that pop up can be shockers) and ultimately it's a predictable picture, but it's definitely a cut above average.

While High Fidelity transplanted its London charm to Chicago, this irresistible comedy was directed by Americans Chris and Paul Weitz (American Pie) with its British pedigree intact. Better yet, Hugh Grant is perfectly cast as Will, a self-absorbed trust-fund slacker who tries to improve his romantic odds by preying on desperate single mothers. His cynical strategy backfires when he recruits the misfit son (Nicholas Hoult) of a suicidal mother (Toni Collette) to pose as his own son, thus proving his parental prowess to his latest single-mom target (Rachel Weisz). The kid has a warming effect on this ultimate cad, and what could have been a sappy tearjerker turns into a subtle, frequently hilarious portrait of familial quirks and elevated self-esteem. From start to finish, it's a genuine treat.Starring Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, Sharon Small, Toni Collette. Director Chris & Paul Weitz. "},{"Title":"A true Hugh performance","Date":"30 March 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" A common theme that runs through much of Nick Hornby's work is that of a shallow man on the road to redemption. Its a theme so beloved of Hornby there are times when I wish he would change his act. About a Boy is very much the same kind of story. The novelty is that instead of a woman providing the catalyst for change, its a child. And while the film version is not an altogether successful translation of the book, it captures much of the novel's spirit, and contains two very good performances from 13 year old Nicholas Hoult and a surprisingly good Hugh Grant.I must admit to not being a particularly huge fan of Hugh Grant. He's certainly one of Britain's most overrated actors, where other more talented Brits like Clive Owen are constantly overlooked. Yet when Owen is given the chance, his acting ability leaves Grant's in the dust. I just don't care much for Grant's purely one-note style of acting. The stumbling, foppish cad who bumbles his way towards a happy ending. The only time he ever impresses is when a director casts him against type. Usually roles where he's well aware of his shallowness, and not blissfully unaware of it, like Bridget Jones's Diary (his finest hour) and About a Boy.Will Freeman (Grant) is the man most teenagers idolise. A man who is comfortably well off, has his pick of any woman, and never has to do a lick of work. Marcus (Hoult) is the teen most people wish they were at 13. Someone who is intuitive and attuned to the world around him. But as a consequence he's an outcast, socially inept and equally maladjusted.These two disparate souls are brought together through sheer circumstance, and the more time they spend with one another, the more they learn from one another. In essence, Will learns to grow up. And Marcus learns to grow down!About a Boy is a film that is almost astonishingly faithful to its novel. About three quarters of the book are exactingly redone for the big screen. It's held onto the character's interior monologues, having two narrators at the same time. In fact the filmmakers reverence for the book is such that sometimes the dialogue is almost indistinguishable. Its really only at the end that the film diverges from the path the novel laid out in favour of a Hollywood style happy ending (no doubt Universal's influence).The success of this story rests on the ability of its cast to pull it off. Hornby's dialogue (he's credited as one of the film's writers) is typically pithy and ironic, but what works on the printed page doesn't always work on screen if the actors aren't up to the task. And I'm happy to say Grant and Hoult are.Hugh Grant is always so much better when he's gleefully aware of his character flaws and doesn't give a damn. Will is a character that is almost tailor-made for Hugh Grant. A man who achieved success in his life (through no effort of his own) and is perfectly comfortable with the life he chooses to live. No responsibilities. No cares. No worries. Grant has an absolute ball in the role of a womanising layabout who coasts by on the hard work of others.But more importantly, Grant is equally (not to mention surprisingly) successful at convincing us there is a more vulnerable soul behind Will's cynical exterior. As he becomes more immersed in Marcus's problems at school and at home, he slowly begins to realise his own life is not so great either. He lives off the royalties of a song his dad wrote. Will never has to work because of someone else's accomplishments. And he slowly begins to realise his life means nothing to nobody. The shock is that Grant actually makes you feel for his plight.But as good as Grant is, newcomer Nicholas Hoult is even better. He does a great job communicating the conflicted feelings of a young man much smarter than those around him, shunned by his age bracket because of it. If that weren't bad enough, he has to look after a suicidal mother (Toni Collette) too wrapped up in her own problems to notice her son's. Watching Marcus make the transition from awkward social reject to well adjusted teenager shows some impeccably controlled acting on Hoult's part. I hope to hear big things from him in the future.Not everything about the film works. Will's relationship with Rachel Weisz never really convinces. It just suddenly comes out of nowhere, and there isn't that much chemistry between the two. Although in a (wise) departure from the book, Will tries to pass Marcus off as his son to get closer to Rachel, and once she learns of the deception, she is understandably hurt and betrayed. The book, more implausibly saw Rachel finding the sense in Will's little white lie. Perhaps Hornby saw his mistake and wanted to rectify it on film.But the way the film changes the book's ending is unforgivable. The novel had a more downbeat climax involving Marcus running away from home. But Universal pulling the strings have insisted on an upbeat, tacked-on happy ending. Involving a concert Marcus puts on to cure his mum's depression. Something purely contrived to help Toni Collette, heal the rift between Will, Rachel and Marcus all at the same time.Its all designed to bring the film to a neat resolution. Its times like this I wish British films nowadays didn't have the backing of American production companies. They end up losing too much in the transfer. Oh well, fun while it lasted. Still, there is plenty to enjoy. Not the least Will and Marcus's insightful opinions on life, some great acting from Grant and Hoult, and the superb soundtrack from Badly Drawn Boy.

Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Hugh Grant, he's got such a charm, I think that's why we can all forgive that little prostitute incident, lol. But anyways, for the most part, Hugh Grant always takes on the same roles for each movie, About a Boy is no exception, he plays a conceited jerk, but this movie put a fresh new twist on your typical romantic comedy movies. It's just always the same story now with romantic comedies, we always have the same guy and girl who fight and fall in love, but About a Boy puts a different look and brings the single mothers in with a guy who absolutely hates kids. Who better to play it? Hugh Grant has that charm to do it and make his character lovable despite his flaws.Will is a single bachelor who is enjoying his life, so much, well, maybe a little too much. His friends are telling him that he should settle down, so they set up him up with a single mother. He hates kids with a passion, but he discovers the benefits of dating a single mother being complimented on being a wonderful guy, lots of sex, and being able to please the kids easily. So when he goes to a single parent's group, he finds a woman he likes, the woman's friend who has a 12 year old son, Marcus, they all go on picnic together. But Marcus's mother tries to kill herself, so he comes up with the clever idea to get them together so she won't feel so lonely.About a Boy is just in general a good movie, it has a strong story and very good actors. Hugh Grant and Nicholas Hoult were very great together, I just loved how they hung out together, my favorite scene was after everyone finds out how Will lied to everyone, that Marcus defended him. As despicable as Will was, at the same time, we all do make stupid mistakes and just need to learn from them.

Yes, Grant plays another thoroughly English cad looking for love in the wrong places but this is something very different. For a start, it's much less frothy than his other films and a lot darker in tone. This is as far removed from nonsense like Two Weeks Notice or Bridget Jones as you can think of and you know something - it's all the better for it.Grant plays Will, a professional bachelor who sponges a living off the royalties of a Christmas one-hit wonder. He likes fast cars, the latest CDs and spending his days killing time. After enjoying a brief fling with a single parent, he decides to focus his efforts on this particular group of women in hope of meaningless sex maybe turning into something else. However, he hits on the wrong woman who turns up to their date with Marcus (Nicholas Hoult). Striking an unlikely friendship with the bullied and seriously uncool Marcus, they both discover that they can learn much about life from the other - much to Will's surprise.Based on the Nick Hornby novel of the same name, About A Boy can best be described as viciously gentle. Tackling difficult issues with humour and pathos is never easy and certainly not when the movie is helmed by the people behind American Pie. But this is one film that really breaks the mould and constantly surprises, Grant playing Will with almost shocking venom for one. Hoult is also very good as poor Marcus, though I did feel that Rachel Weisz was little more than underused eye candy. Toni Collette also does well as Marcus's bohemian mother but I felt the role was under-developed in relation to the role in the book. Something else that also changed was the ending, which veered away from the whole 'Kurt Cobain' theme of the novel and dangerously towards something like an American high school comedy. But at its heart, About A Boy is an affecting drama as well as a effective comedy. But rarely is it hilarious and this does hinder the film's appeal somewhat.So it's a pleasant surprise lifted by class performances in the leads but like the novel, I never really felt like it deserved the amount of praise heaped upon it. The novel left me feeling cold and unengaged and the movie does too, to some extent. The characters are too remote, almost implausible, for the audience to empathise with but in spite of this, About A Boy is a hard film to dislike. Like I said, it's a very gentle film - one that surprises and even challenges you but it just never raises its game enough. A good film, then and one that certainly goes down better than Bridget Jones The Edge Of Reason at any rate...

He sticks with the John Milton motto of Every man is an island and feels rather content about it, shagging women as he goes along.In the end, though, he realizes that he has accomplished nothing in his life, that he needs other people and the emotions associated with them and everything ends happily. Or does it? )The movie is filled with good British humour, sarcastic and powerful, funny situations and the kind of feeling that gets you to smile during the entire film. I do despise the moral, but at least it is not soapy. It is perfect to watch with the girlfriend and even a tight bunch of guys would appreciate the movie.

This is a very well-directed movie. I suspect the target audience who will appreciate this movie will either have children, or be at least 30 years old.I would not have appreciated this movie when I was 25 years old.This movie is surprisingly well-directed. The acting is very good, with characters coming into the story that can make you believe this story is an actual documentary. But it's not.I won't give away any of the story, as it's well worth learning on your own.But I am a bit surprised that this movie is rated PG-13. While it mostly fits into this category, it does have scenes which only an older audience who has experienced love and/or a man who is a late-in-life Player mentality. The topics of sex, which the main male character seemingly sugar-coats over the real cravings of an adult, will probably be lost on the younger crowd, if not deemed inappropriate for the younger crowd.The discussion boards for this movie have proved this. But for the right audience, this movie is surprisingly well done, despite the cheezy box cover for the DVD and the first half hour.

Not so much because his personality dictates, as he is just unable to give anyone a chance. When asked to be the Godfather of his best friends newborn daughter, he states what a bad idea that is since when she turns 18 he will probably try to shag her. Happy to live in isolation until one day Marcus(Nicholas Holt) a young man Will met while on a date,calls him on his ruse. The two become reluctant friends. The boy having to grow up too fast the man never growing up.The two lead actors are amazing. Grant does his best work here. And Holt keeps up rather well.

This movie knows exactly what it is and to be fair is quite predictable but the tender, spot-on performance coupled with a very real script make About a Boy a winner from start to finish.The characters, start out as stereotypical cut-outs. Hugh Grant is the 21st century man, living alone with all his mod-cons and yet he does nothing. He does not have a job and lives off the royalties of a hit jingle written by his dad. Nicholas Hoult on the other hand is the archetypal geek who gets bullied at school and yet his mother is a suicidal depressant and he just wants a father figure.The relationship between the two characters is built slowly and carefully with both Grant and Hoult helping each other to be better people. Contrasting from the hilarious to the downright tragic. About a Boy is simply a good film about good people and so what if its predictable, these are characters who you cannot help but care about.Both Hoult and Grant are standouts in a cast that includes Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz, Hoult especially being adept at comedic and emotional situations You cannot help but feel for him as he stands alone singing 'Killing Me Softly' in front of his school bullies but feel that upswing of joy when Grant joins him on stage with guitar.

Now I'm glad I did because this was a bloody good film!!!!! LOL!!!!!!! Anyways the whole point to this movie is about a young boy and a man. In a way I guess you can say that they needed each other. The young boy (Marcus) is going through a rough time at both home and school. He has a mentally ill mother and a tough time at school because everybody judges him because he's a little strange. Now the man (Will) is a low life with a great house. He has no job and he loves women. He trys to meet younger women by a club called SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) because he thinks most of the good looking women are parents. He mets a women there and from her he meets Marcus. And they go through the roughest times together. I love this movie a lot and the meaning of it. It's great to see with your loved ones and good friends. Great laughs. Loud cries. "},{"Title":"Mix of comedy and drama","Date":"19 December 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" There were several aspects that made me appreciate this movie despite my personal reluctance to commend comedies of similar arrangements.First of all I found the inner monologues of the two main characters an inventive and unusual feature. This added to the comedy aspect and caused hilarious scenes. In addition it added depth to the characters themselves, which is something comedies of this sort normally lack. To put this into the right perspective, some of the thoughts we are presented with are rather artificial, but still, the approach itself and its effect on the storyline is something that needs to be appreciated.The plot is modest, but has some unexpected strengths. I was frankly surprised about the mix of realistic challenges of life and the comedy aspects, as I thought the latter would be the movie's emphases. However, they were in balance - the movie dealt with real problems many members of the audience are probably able to relate to. The comedy was sometimes too artificial, but it seems to have worked in this case.Hugh Grant and his attitude towards life is one major theme, Nicholas Hoult's portrayal of Marcus the second prevailing one. The movie then focuses on these two characters and makes them influence each other - which leads to interesting changes and challenges for the protagonists, and that is what puts this movie above the ordinary.I generally do not like Hugh Grant's humor. Here again he seems a bit uncomfortable as Nicholas' partner. He kind of aces his comedy parts with his very own sense of entertaining the audience, but as soon as it comes to difficult scenes demanding more than superficial acting, he seems - yeah, a bit uneasy.Nonetheless, considering the general lack of sophistication comedies such as these aim at, this movie is an improvement. The father-son relationship which is subtly addressed lacks real emotional depth - again something which accrues from the movie's arrangement as a comedy - but is decent to watch and carries some messages.I personally like Hugh Grant's philosophy of life - something many male singles will be able to relate to somehow - and the way he justifies his attitude. The changes which happen after he has encountered Marcus make this movie worthwhile, as they entail a character development and some messages of life.'No man is an island' - Marcus' last words and his face as the closing scene made me appreciate this movie as a whole, because it really made its way off the corny trash and has managed to mix comedy with sincere issues of life - something hard to find.

Firstly I had seen High Fidelity the movie based on another of Hornby's books and was very disappointed. Secondly I had a mild allergy to Hugh Grant who previously had seemed only capable of playing the same helpless, foppish character in every movie. The kind of character that women allegedly find adoring on screen, but if you were ever to act that way in reality they would beat you senseless with a frying pan after an hour.Imagine my surprise then when I was treated to this absolutely stunning movie. Hugh Grant finally proved that he can act and does a stunning job in a new type of character. Likewise the boy is excellent as are all other actors. This movie is totally engrossing and hugely entertaining while still tackling difficult subjects like growing up and trying to fit in at school while you have problems at home. It combines serious issues but also some very amusing scenes as well. The pacing is perfect and the music compliments the atmosphere admirably.There is no other movie that I have ever watched as many times as I have this one. Every time I enjoy it and marvel at it. I am totally unable to criticise it as the whole thing meshes to a very, very satisfying piece of work. Certainly one of my favorites, up there in the company of 12 Angry Men, The Usual Suspects and other excellent movies.

I also laughed hysterically, especially when Grant's character can't even attempt doing philanthropic work without turning it into another opportunity to hit on a woman - a woman he hasn't even seen yet, he's so overzealous.Hugh Grant, who i have always found attractive, absolutely outdid himself. He showed a person with a lot more going on in his brain than trying to seduce all the women of the world with his looks. He was perfect in this role (maybe too perfect, eh?) as a pathetic,shallow man but who finds he is capable of so much more.it is brilliant that a child comes along to rescue him, to show him the way to love, that the movies depicts love in our difficult times. It was the love in the movie that moved me.it seems that the filmmaker has gone through a similar metamorphosis going from shallow themes to this! Applause!!!!!!!!

The acting was great and the story made sense. Hugh Grant does an excellent job as Will, a 38-year-old kid who's never grown up. Living off the inheritance his father earned from writing an embarrassing hit, Will spends most of his time in front of the TV or computer, buying expensive luxuries, or going through dates like popcorn. So cool that he's cold, he doesn't care that the world doesn't think much of him; as far as he's concerned, he doesn't need anybody to get close. On the other end of the scale, 12-year-old Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) is considered weird even by the least popular kids at school. He has the habit of unconsciously singing aloud, & acts & dresses odd because of his mother's (Toni Collette) decisions. He also acts much older than his age, since he has to deal w/her depression & trying to make himself invisible from bullies. When Will finds single mothers are the best dates for their lack of protest during a break-up, he joins a single parents support group & ends up meeting Marcus, whose mother tries to commit suicide. Marcus then enlists Will's help to date her, so she can get over her depression, then discovers that he's neither a divorcée nor a father. He regularly visits Will by blackmail, & as they become friends, he confesses he has a rough social life. Will begins to show a better side of himself when he helps Marcus to become cool, until his secret is discovered. Now he gets Marcus to help him land a real date when he falls in love, since he doesn't have anything else that would impress women, & along the way he learns how to be an adult. This is a bit like The Kid, but instead of having the kid show the adult how to stop being cynical, this kid teaches how to stop being shallow. The message is great, & so is the way the 2 main characters interact w/each other. I wish the language wasn't so bad, but that barely effects the movie. Enjoy the moral among the charm & laughs this has to offer. "},{"Title":"Terrific","Date":"7 June 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" This movie is a great. Hip, smart, but heartwarming, About A Boy is the tale of Will, an English womanizer who will do literally anything to get women.

As their friendship develops they teach each other something about love, friendship, family, and how to love and be loved is the most important thing on earth.Hugh Grant is superb as Will. This character could have been written with him in mind. His dry wit and comic timing will have you laughing. Toni Collette (The Sixth Sense, Emma) shines as Marcus' mother, a clinically depressed single mum struggling to stay sane for her son. The young Nicholas Hoult is a natural as Marcus, a lonely school outcast wiser than his years.The music, performed by British band Badly Drawn Boy is excellent, the soundtrack standing on it's own as a must-have album.

So I guess, if you liked him in the movies that I previously mentioned, than you should give this one a try as well. If not, than you better leave it alone.This time, Grant plays the role of Will. Will is a hip guy who lives on his own in a nice loft in London, who drives a fancy car, who wears pretty clothes and who doesn't have to work because he lives of the royalties from a Christmas song his dad once wrote, and what's even better for him he doesn't have a family to take care of... And then he thinks of a new tactic to pick up single women. He'll go to a self-help group for single parents where he, while passing himself for a single dad (which he isn't of course), can meet a lot of young single mothers, all very eager to become his next sexual object. But Will's hope of staying a bachelor for the rest of his life is interrupted when he meets the 12-year old Marcus, a very uncool kid that will eventually teach him how to grow up as he teaches the kid to be cool...In a way this is a very typical Grant movie. I wouldn't even be surprised if someone told me that this movie was written especially for him. And it has to be said, he does a nice job. It's all rather predictable of course and you know what will happen most of the time, but that doesn't mean the movie isn't any good. I really liked Grant as the eternal bachelor and all other actors did a nice job as well. That's why I give this movie a 7/10.

Even though the title clearly told me it was About A Boy. However, the movie quickly evolves into a good and well written film.Being a huge fan of Hugh Grant I of course was encouraged to check out this film. Hugh Grant delivers another classic humorous performance. He plays a selfish man who lives all by himself and does nothing for a living. They aren't kidding when they say nothing. After getting rich off of this father's one hit wonder song, Will (Grant) never had any inspiration to do work in life. He just searches around aimlessly for some type of romance. One day, he meets a lady who is a single parent. Will soon discovers that single mothers are great people to date. Not only are they good people, but also they are vulnerable. In a desperate attempt to find more single mothers, Will visits a single parents club. At this group he lies to many of these mothers by telling them he has a child. Eventually he gets a date with a women there who introduces him to her friends son named Marcus, a scrawny 12 year old boy. Marcus takes comfort in Will when his mother loses it, creating a bonding friendship between Will and Marcus.What's charming about this film is the fact that thirty something and a 12 year old are able to become such great friends. The whole thought of it sounds a bit crazy but thats what really helps to bring this film to life. Along with great writers as well as great performances from Hugh Grant and from NIcholas Hoult (Marcus) So overall I would recommend this film to anybody who enjoys a good heartwarming comedy.

His life is then interrupted by an unwelcome 12 year old boy Marcus who wants to be his friend and this is where the story matures. Least to say I was pleasantly surprised after seeing this film only disappointed by the fact I didn't get to see it in the cinema with the addition of the crowd's laughter. Hugh Grant plays Will the irresponsible big kid in the movie that is most likely the envy of most men out there. With this character I think this is where Grant shines as an actor in the perfect part for him, a dry witted bachelor who is afraid of commitment but still gets to go out with nice ladies and have lots of cool big boy's toys in his spacious well equipped apartment. Think American Psycho without the killings.There is one feature in the film that I particularly do not like which made me realize, how important it is to choose the right 'Music' for a film. Most of the music in the film is done by 'Badly Drawn Boy' although not particularly bad when heard once but it is played throughout the whole film. It is suited to some scenes but there could have been a little variety.Even though the film does have strong themes about growing up and taking responsibility, it never gets too serious to take you out of a giddy mood.This is highly recommended for Hugh Grant fans and anyone who enjoyed 'Four weddings and a funeral'.8* out of 10 "},{"Title":"Bewitching","Date":"29 October 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Normally I'm not a huge fan of Hugh Grant.

One is B J's diary - he seems to ring truer playing a nasty character. The other is in this film. In About A Boy, he is a lazy b*****d with few morals - the kind of person with more money than they deserve who annoys the rest of society, unless he's buying something expensive from your shop. Alone, this portrayal would be amusing. But what makes About A Boy great is the other characters in combination with this one.

What we see, like or dislike in him may be what we see, like or dislike in ourselves.It's a rare trait to have, and Hugh Grant seems to possess it in abundance.  No particular point of view. No special ambition.  No burning agenda.Thus his role in About a Boy is ideal for this fine actor. Grant perfectly plays this vapid, irresponsible playboy, who fortunately realizes his own lack of character and grows in the enactment.He has help from other characters with whom he comes in contact, including a boy and some single-parent moms.  While the growth may be minimal, there's some progress, and the promise of future pleasantries with a congenial groupie.Like his role in Notting Hill, the feel of this comedy drama's light as a souffle, yet constantly buoyed by Grant's unique persona and neat direction by Chris and Paul Weitz (memorable from Chuck and Buck). About a Boy may seem lightweight, yet notice how it holds the attention straight through to its consonant conclusion.  "}{"Title":"Very original film","Date":"17 June 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Strangely enough, this modestly produced film is one of the most original recent films. Most comedies fit into some other genre (Romantic, Dumb, etc.) but this one doesn't. The closest it gets is romantic comedy, but that doesn't even fit. Also, the writer of the book, Nick Hornby, helped with the movie, which has had some great changes, namely a much better ending than in the book.Hugh Grant is at his best here, as a very cynical bachelor of about thirty named Will who doesn't have the pressure of work upon him, thus devoting all his time to women. He kind of reminds me of a high school student. Being the Love them and leave them type, he has had his share of breakups. Then he dates a single mum. Just as he's about to break up with her, she breaks up with him! As Will puts it, Guilt free parting. Thus, Will is on an endless search for single mums. Through this search he meets Marcus, a schoolboy has trouble being a boy, played by Nicholas Hoult.About a Boy says quite a lot, if you manage to catch it, and is one of the funnier non-Dumb comedies out there, (curiously enough, directed by the brothers who gave you American Pie.) and it's overall quite enjoyable to watch. Grant and Hoult are hilarious together, with their extreme character contrasts. A thousand word review can hardly do it justice.  "},{"Title":"It's Hugh Grant's best work to date. It's based on a hugely successful book and it's funny as hell. What's not to like?","Date":"10 June 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I first saw this movie while on a business trip to Chattanooga. I needed to finish up some work on a presentation I was making the next day and there was nothing on TV, so I decided to splurge and rent an On-Demand movie. Most of the movies I had either seen, or had no interest in seeing and just as I was about to turn it off, I came across About A Boy. I hadn't heard much buzz about the movie and I'm not a fan of Hugh Grant, but for reasons unknown to me, I rented it.I was expecting another one of Hugh Grant's saccharine romantic comedies where he plays a charming befuddling fop as he's done ad nauseam since Four Weddings And A Funereal. Granted, I liked Four Weddings immensely, but by Notting Hill I'd had my fill. Much to my surprise, Grant was playing a completely different character and was clearly attempting to break his mold. He'd done that once before in Bridget Jones' Diary, where he played a jerk, but now he was taking it in another direction entirely. It's a refreshing and more importantly interesting change.But this movie isn't all about Hugh Grant's character Will. His co-star is new comer Nicholas Hoult, who plays the boy Marcus and he carries his own. Ultimately, the movie is about both of them, and so Hoult has the responsibility of carrying half the weight of the movie and he does a splendid job. Rounding out the cast is Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz, each do an excellent job as well. Suffice to say that the casting for this movie is brilliant. Each character is fully developed and rich with complexity and emotion. I bought each and every one of them. Not once did I feel that there was a weak link in the bunch. That's also surprising because this type of movie is hard to pull off.So what kind of movie is this? At it's heart, this movie is a comedy. That being said, with subject matter such as suicide, it is most definitely a drama as well. That's a fine line to walk in a film but Weitz Brothers deftly manage to pull it off. Granted their movie is based on the Hornby book by the same name, so they had a rich palette to begin with, but the brothers clearly rose to the challenge and created a fantastic movie. There have been plenty of good books that have been butchered at the box office and Boy is a rare exception. There's no cliche' choices made by the characters and the director's did a great job at staying true to the tone of the book. Chris and Paul also stretched themselves with their camera work and it pays off. If you're into `film' there's a lot to chew on between the use of jump cuts, depth of focus and swing shots. None of this gets in the way of the movie. If anything these camera techniques add to the performances and help tell the story.Interweaving it's way throughout the movie and in some cases almost playing a role in the film, is the music and it is spot on. All the music was written by Badly Drawn Boy specifically for this movie. I was not familiar with the artist prior to seeing the film, but the director's couldn't have made a better choice. Although each song stands on it's own on the soundtrack, each song also easily blends into the scene and lends a hand in creating just the right tone for the movie. After listening to the soundtrack, I could imagine it as simply a regular artist release, so it stands on it's own. Yet when it's worked into the movie it's pure gold.So why do I like it so much? I'd like to think that I'm not alone in this, but it's because I can relate to the movie on so many levels. There are so many scenes that I could describe, but in the end I would be retelling the entire movie. Every scene has something in it that is worth watching again and again. I can relate to Marcus as he's picked on in school, tries to cope with his mother's depression and ultimately knowingly faces complete and utter embarrassment as a last ditch effort to make his mother happy. The names and places have been changed to protect the innocent, but I've been there. Then there's Will who has to finally face his demons and his father's legacy in order to join the human race and be a part of other peoples lives. Although not an exact context, I've been there in one way shape or form.Surprisingly, I caught myself watching it again the other day on DVD and it struck me that this movie is now in my Top 10, or dare I say Top 5 movie list. I maybe be borrowing from another fantastic Hornby book/movie High Fidelity, but it's true. It's not Citizen Kane, but it is one of the best movies that takes a funny look at becoming a man through two different people. In trying to describe this movies to others, I've called it `A guy's romantic comedy.' That doesn't really nail it on the head, but I'd like to think that About A Boy, IS a guy's movie. The subject matter may not have Rambo's, or Rocky's, but any guy who can think about something other than sports, or monster trucks should get something from this movie. It's Hugh Grant's best work to date. It's based on a hugely successful book and it's funny as hell. What's not to like?I give it a 5 out of 5 stars. "},{"Title":"Sweet, and charming.

Hugh Grant stars as Will, who differs from most of us in such a fundamental way that it makes him a very interesting guy. What makes Will out-of-sync with the world is that his late father once wrote a famous and with the royalties he collects from it, he doesn't have to work to sustain himself financially. The downside of this, of course, is that he doesn't have anything substantial or fulfilling in his life but he's very comfortable with that, at least at the beginning of the story.     What changes Will's life is the inadvertent introduction of a 12-year old boy and his suicidal mother (Toni Collette) into his life when a scheme to meet an attractive mom backfires. Like some of the best relationships in life, Will's with the 12-year old Marcus is involuntary at first but the two learn a lot from each other. With a of fear of losing his mother and an uneasiness about whom he can depend on, Will gives Marcus someone to look up to, while Marcus enables Will to find meaning in his life, especially when Will meets a woman he feels he might be able to fall in love with (Rachel Weicz).       This is the second Hugh Grant film that I've seen this year, which surprises me considering I still don't think Hugh Grant works most of the time. I credit this to an excellent adaptation of Hornsby's novel that adds more depth to Grant's role than the usual bumbling romantic lead, and also because within the setting of London Grant works better within the cultural context. The boy who plays Marcus is a cute kid who's easy to dislike at the beginning, but proves pretty bright when he takes Will's immensely useful tip that it is possible to change his level of coolness simply by changing some of the little things in his appearance (getting a haircut, buying new shoes, etc). Watching that scene warmly brings back memories of that monumental day in our own lives when it dawned upon is after years of feeling hopeless within our grade school social circles that it is, in fact, possible to change your level of coolness. The film is filled with a lot of those little things in life we can relate to so much more than we thought we would.

A movie about a guy who wants for nothing in life, but due to his growing relationship with a boy who is having problems living with his suicidal single mother, Grant's character begins to want for a little more in his empty, lonely life.Ok, guys, watch the movie with the girlfriend if you like, but it is certainly worth watching.

Only generally ok, though, because of the huge gaps it leaves at certain points. To this end, I found watching the deleted scenes on the dvd useful do so if you get the chance.

I had been watching a load of foreign action movies and felt it was time to treat her to a light romantic comedy. Don't get me wrong, Mrs. Ennui's favorite movie is THE MATRIX and she loves flicks that we label with the acronym LOSBU, which stands for lots of 'stuff' blows up, but her lack of a Y chromosome surfaces occasionally and she needs something emotionally uplifting or heart-wrenchingly dreadful. (I have no idea how one woman can go from re-watching THE MATRIX to re-watching STEEL MAGNOLIAS in one day without suffering some long term effects, but that's the mystery we call woman. I digress.) ABOUT A BOY was meant to fill that love story niche. In some ways I guess it does--except that it's a love story about a grown man and a twelve year old boy (not in any sick way), his mom, another lady, that lady's twelve year old son and the rest of the world. It's also a coming of age story--except that it's the grown man who comes of age. Frankly, it's a little difficult to pigeon-hole. However, it delivers a quirky, charming story that isn't too cute and doesn't resort to the usual romantic comedy clichés. The fact is, despite my best efforts, I truly enjoyed it. It is what it is and that's all that it is, but it does what it does with a clever trick or two. A good example of the film's subtlety (and a possible ***SPOILER***so I'll label it as such lest I lose any privileges) Our hero, an oddly conforming yet proudly non-conformist type, walks aimlessly against the flow of busy office workers dressed in their drab gray suits while he stands out in a camouflage jacket. It is a revealing scene that is both elegant and understated. That's not a level of understanding that a normal romantic-comedy-type movie would bother with. I guess I don't want to comment too greatly on the movie beyond that. Like a soap bubble, I'm afraid that my enjoyment might disperse if I delve too deeply.An excellent date movie.

There was Hugh Grant, this little boy I had never seen, and some women who fitted the chick flick criteria perfectly. In the end I backed my better judgement and decided to give the movie a go, but even though Grant was headlining I was still trepidacious.  About a Boy is exceptional, in not only its story telling and unravelling of the characters but in its balance between humour, sadness and interesting thought provoking points of view.  Grant plays Will, a self indulgent wannabe romeo, who spends his days using up 'units of time' as he puts it. In one of the funniest passages in the movie he describes this concept, and without delving into it too much he believes that he enjoys a perfect balance of relaxation and fun.  How can he do this you might ask; easy, you live off the royalties of your father's hit Christmas song.  He is convinced in himself, he knows what he is and what he wants to do and his pathway is clear of such daily obstacles like finance, trust, dependance and stress. He is complete.  But he's not of course.  Deep down he knows the shallowness of such an existance where the innocent daily ritual of watching quiz shows blends into his alter-ego nightlife.Void of any life variables he exists in his vacuum, until a twelve year old boy uncovers a sinister truth.  Will you see has been on the search for available women, and he uncovers a group whereby single mothers go to feel good about themselves and to relieve the stresses of total independence. He is the only male single parent in the group, and soon he weaves a web of deception about his very own son.  The women fall for it.  He is pleased with his efforts and another lie is notched onto his bedpost.  The movie gets going when Will and a mother from the group decide to meet, but she brings along with her the boy of another woman who has been ill.  From then on relationships are formed, dissolved, papered over and engineered.The movie was superb in almost every respect.  The directors needn't have looked no further than Grant, for if you want caddish charm and an air of unassured assurance, Grant is your man.  He is wonderful throughout.  The 'boy' in question is played brilliantly by Nicholas Hoult as Marcus, the son of a hippie type who cannot get to grips with the evolving millenium.  He doesn't seem like other kids and sometimes I wondered whether or not the movie would fob me off with another 'the underachieving nobody defeats all in the end' tagline.  To a tiny extent it does, but the story remains real and believable to itself which was refreshing.  And Toni Collete is also wonderful as Fiona, the depressive mother of Marcus.  Their love for each other is evident, but she frets that she cannot give the thing she cherishes the most the best in life.  Marcus doesn't mind, he just wants her to be there for him, although the inner rejection she feels for not being the perfect mother is sometimes too much to handle in some harrowing scenes.All of the other characters also played their parts extremely well.  It was an exciting and rivetting movie, that had its fair share of serious moments as well as some brilliantly executed comic scenes.  It is also deeply touching, with a sort of refreshing feel good factor that firmly bases itself on reality.  By that I mean that not all questions were answered, and that some aspects of life remain troubling.  The central combination of Will and Marcus worked splendidly as well.  Marcus' naivity and innocence was blended paradoxically with a kind of know how and some semblance of street wise occasionally.  Inquisitive and well meaning, the partnership forged between the two was entertaining if nothing else.  Watch it if you can, even if at first you have some reservations like me, because About a Boy is a genuinely terrific movie.  People grow, find a certain peace with themselves and along the way involve themselves in moments of comedy.  An excellent movie.

It has tremendous heart. Will (played by Hugh Grant) is a slacker who lives off royalties of his father's one hit song. Through a series of sleazy events (he joins a single parent group to meet loose chicks) he meets a boy named Marcus (Nicholas Hault) who is going through a crisis. His mom is suicidal and he realizes if she goes, he'll be all alone. So he starts hanging out with Will in an attempt to make a friend to lean on. Will takes to Marcus and becomes sort of a mentor of coolness (Marcus's mother is a hippie, so she doesn't know what's what). Eventually Will takes Marcus for granted and realizes that he is only a shell of a man, who is nothing without his friend Marcus. The movie's moral is 'No man is an Island' and that you need people in your life to make it worthwhile. From the directors of 'American Pie' and the Author of 'High Fidelity'. Hugh Grant is very charming in this and all the performances are wonderful. Stays very true to the great book, while changing the ending (which is better in the film).

However, despite its very definition, I was not prepared for the surprise I had while watching this film.  Perhaps it is because I went into it expecting to hate it, but because of my New Year's resolution to try to be more open-minded in my film viewing I decided to give it a shot.  (That doesn't mean that I am about to watch anything involving J. Lo or Sandra Bullock &#150; a woman has her limits) But I'll tell you why I expected to hate it  My grandmother and aunt loved it.  Absolutely nothing against their taste in films, but I've generally learned that I will never accept Meg Ryan as my personal savior, and they will never worship at the altar of Stanley Kubrick.  So I went into About a Boy with trepidation, but I went into it.What a wonderful choice, because it is an amazing film.  While under the guise of a comedy, it examines some very compelling issues, and treats them seriously.  Hugh Grant, who I feel has not done a decent film since Four Weddings and a Funeral, is brilliant in his portrayal of Will, a guy who has no idea what he wants in life and is one step worse than shallow  He readily acknowledges his shallowness.  Newcomer Nicholas Hoult is endearing as Marcus, the 12 year old boy Will begrudgingly takes under his wing.  (This kid also has the most interesting eyebrows in cinema right now)  Toni Collette rounds out the main cast as Marcus' depressed mother, a woman whose fragility is painful to experience through the eyes of her son. In terms of the story, the theme of `finding oneself' is certainly not new to cinema, but About a Boy addresses it in such a charming manner that even this extremely cynical viewer was drawn in immediately.  I watched this film (as I do most films) by myself, and was actually disappointed when I had to immediately interact with friends after seeing it because it's subtle profundity made me want to sit and reflect upon it.Although I generally don't like the actors involved, I don't normally `do' touching comedies, and About A Boy is the first Nick Hornby book I wasn't able to get through, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, so that makes this a great film in my eyes. And for once this is a movie that I can pretty much recommend to anyone.  So what do I think of praising a film my grandmother loved?

The other actor is Hugh Grant who created a stereotype for himself in 1994 as Charles the bumbling, clever English guy in Four Weddings and a Funeral. It's an image he's tried hard to shake, and he just might have done it with About A Boy. Oh, he's still clever, and he's still English, but now he is a trust-fund baby, who treats women miserably and hasn't worked a day in his life. As Will, Grant brings to life one of the screen's most unabashedly self absorbed characters.

About a Boy succeeds in every area where High Fidelity failed; it not only faithfully recaptures the tone of the novel, but expands upon it to make a very good movie.Possibly the largest problem with High Fidelity was that it was adapted to an American setting, with American characters. I don't believe either setting is objectively better, but both of Hornby's books are extremely British. The characters, the dialogue, the settings, all work because of their original setting. When making High Fidelity the filmmakers seemed to think they could solve this problem with name actors and by cranking up the volume (a typical problem with Americanizations). It just didn't work.About a Boy succeeds because it is low-volume. It is a very low-key study of a small set of characters and their relationships. I've never been a fan of Hugh Grant - the nod and tick, the self-conscious stammering - but he does an excellent job in this role. In fact, all of the actors are quite good. And the director does an admirable job of not allowing the story to become sappy or manipulative. Perhaps the biggest difference between the two adapations is that in this one there is no talking to the camera, a conceit that has become pervasive and annoying. There are voiceovers (as there is a lot of inner monologue that must be explained) but they do not detract from the experience.It is odd that one can spend so long talking about the faults of something they dislike, but explaining what one likes is so difficult. This movie simply works; it is a complete, self-contained universe and is very effective. I highly recommend it.

I laughed out loud at some of Will's delivery about life while caring about Marcus's optimistic take on life.   It's hard enough to deal with school problems at any age but also dealing with his mother's depression makes things unbearable, but Marcus perseveres.Will finally realizes what kind of life Marcus has had and starts to see things from another viewpoint.

The great irony about 'About a boy' is that owning up to liking Hugh Grant is as about as cool as the Sahara, yet here he plays the very cool Will and pulls it off effortlessly. At first we see him as an arogant b****rd - albeit a very funny arogant b****rd. And then Marcus, the boy of the title, and the total opposite to Will - Very uncool, unpopular, yet original, invades Will's life and actually manages to give Will's life some meaning, whilst Will in his own way gives Marcus the confidence to face up to his own problems. The performances are great, the humour very funny, and for once the moving scenes are moving yet not overly done (Billy Elliot, another British comedy, p***ed me off with the way it seemed to try so hard to make us blub), and is a thoroughly enjoyable way of spending an hour and a half. Really there is good drama, a few scenes that will genuinly have you clutching your sides, and though you'll know from the beginning that the plot will tie up nicely for everyone at the end, this will still give you a warm heart and a goofy grin slapped all over your face long after the credits roll - go cheer yourself up and see this movie.

I always think that a perfect movie must be suitable for everybody (except in a very few exceptions), as the classic film makers showed us decades ago.Regarding photography and art direction, it has some interior scenes which I found very beautiful and inspiring, specially those in restaurants.By the way, if you have the DVD, don't miss the suppressed scenes. It has one which makes you understand the Ellie character (Nat Gastiain Tena) a lot better. Unfortunately they suppressed it from the movie because they considered it competed against the main characters relationships.I voted it 9/10.

However you'd like to call it, it's a great movie. Hugh Grant comes out repeating a bit of the character that he did in `Nine Months' only this time his character is even shallower and the plot is much better. I think what most Americans need to understand when they watch a British comedy is that (despite the fact that they speak English) their sense of humor is a little different. It's more understated than the average American humor is so I can see how some Americans found this film to be slow and boring. If you need the wacky antics of Adam Sandler or Jim Carrey in order to laugh, this movie probably isn't for you. If you can appreciate nuances, facial expressions and innuendos you'll like the movie as much as I did. It's very well directed and the characters' personalities are truly captured in a very real way.That's not all. It's not JUST a funny movie. Behind the shallowness and eccentricity of the people in the show there is also depression, disgust, hope and even a moral. How many movies will give you all that in an hour and a half? Not many. Even though Grant does a fine job in the leading role the strength of the film is in the entire cast. Marcus (the boy character) is wonderfully honest and sometimes blunt, his mother is off the wall and the kids at school are horribly monstrous. You really feel as though this is true to life. It is a very modern story of what families are made up of these days blood relatives, step relatives and friends.If you're still reading this comment, I think that you out to see the movie. It's definitely worth the few bucks you'll spend to take it home for a few days.

This is a film of importance if only because it doesn't take itself too seriously.  It's just straight story-telling from two distinct and authentic narrative voices; Will's and Marcus'.  Now, this is a film which takes a subject as serious as a mother attempting suicide, and makes it a comfortable moment for comedy.  There's nothing funny about the event, oh no, but the characters involved can't help not feeling awful the rest of the movie.  Marcus is extremely proactive in helping those around him, and his circle of friends slowly grows.  Will, on the other hand, is who this film becomes all about.  We know Marcus is always going to have a straight outlook on things, no matter what life throws him.  It's up to Will to change, and it's outstanding how he can come out of his shell without sacrificing his coolness.  What sets About a Boy apart from other films about cool people learning to let down their guard and love somebody, is that in the end they've sacrificed some of their cool-ness.  Will is always a charmer, right to the end, but he manages to really change, and you can't help but marvel at the effortlessness.

As usual (for Nick Hormby) it is set in his beloved north London, plus some stuff in what must be Shoreditch and Smithfield.  Why is Will (Hugh Grant) always driving through the meat market?  Is that a metaphor for his pulling lifestyle?  Is that what SPAT is?  Of course (in real life) Smithfield is about to be relocated, and the old market turned into a consumer haven presumably, probably along the lines of Covent Garden.  About time, too.Actually, you could call this entire film About Time Too, as Will must finally enter normal, family life.Nick Hornby has done some excellent stuff (if you forgive him the Arsenal stuff - not half as angst-ridden as supporting Chelsea), though it's a bit like Teach Yourself Screenwriting what with all the classic character transformation.  Even the hippy-depressive Fiona (Toni Collette) ends up liking McDonalds though you knew it would be too much for her and Will to end up together, hence the Amnesty International connection.  Is this the first time that Amnesty has been linked with romance?  Maybe the theme of the film is the final amnesty on Will's years of selfish singlehood.And the U2 song! Right now, I'm listening to Mandela Day - 'it was 25 years ago to this day'.  Will is 38 and it's 25 years since he entered puberty and about time that he became a couple, not a single man forever.

Well, I for one forsee the downfall of James Bond as we know it. The considerations are a black actor, Hugh Grant, Christian Bale, and Jude Law, not to mention another black actor Will Smith. Yes, you read that right. Apart from black actors--really, Bond being black?--Hugh Grant is probably the worst choice for Bond. But as far as romantic comedies go, he's not that bad.About a Boy is about a childish, whiny, selfish, greedy, miserable young man (Grant) who finds that single parents are best for dating. So he enters into a single parents group, where he proceeds to tell the lie that he has a child. Soon, he is going out with a woman who believes he has a son--who introduces him to a friend's pre-teen, named Marcus. Marcus' mother attempts to commit suicide, and it screws up the kid, so he starts to go over to Grant's home every day after school. Grant eventually admits he has no child, and the woman he had been going out with pretty much dumps him. But Marcus keeps coming over every day. Eventually Grant starts to help Marcus out by trying to help him fit into his school better; he buys him trainers, CDs, a personal CD player, etc. And then Grant's character meets Rachel (Rachel Weisz), who he proceeds to tell that he has a son, for certain reasons. So eventually Rachel wants to see his son. Trouble. And then Grant gets Marcus to pose as his son while he gets personal with Rachel. Trouble solved. For now.About a Boy is based on the bestselling novel by Nicholas Hornby, author of High Fidelity--which was turned into a film with John Cusack that took place in Chicago instead of London--and a few other hits. I've never read his work, but I think it's been done justice for the most part.About a Boy is a good comedy, with some funny British humor. It was good, but not great. I enjoyed Notting Hill more, to tell you the truth. I think About a Boy took quite a long time getting to where it was going. Ranking in at about two hours, that's a bit long for a romantic comedy, especially when the love interest is introduced an hour and nine minutes into the film. The setup itself takes over an hour to establish. Many, many scenes could have been cut to make room for more time after Grant meets Rachel. But instead, the filmmakers take so much time building up to that point, that by the time they finally arrive to the romance part, they have about fifty minutes to deal with a LOT of things that happen. Perhaps that is why the last hour seems so rushed and thrown together compared to the beginning.But it's still a pretty funny film. I'm not especially fond of Hugh Grant, but his romantic comedies can be pretty good--I really enjoyed Notting Hill, and I don't like Roberts, either. The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain was also a good British comedy. And there's no doubting About a Boy is good, but it's not great, and a lot of scenes could and should have been cut. Isn't it ironic that I think one of the deleted scenes on the DVD should have been left in the film?3.5/5 Stars--or 7/10 Stars--John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Another dud","Date":"30 March 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  This year a movie called about a boy came out.

Written by the living master of the men behaving badly, but trying to get better style, Nick Hornby (High Fidelity); this film introduces us to Will, played by Hugh Grant. A loafer, living off the royalties of a popular Christmas tune written by his father, Will has created the ultimate bachelor life of temporary relationships and comfortable solitude. After an odd revelation, he begins to pursue single mothers for his romantic flings. This brings him into contact with twelve year old Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) and his troubled, suicidal mother Fiona, expertly played by the versatile Toni Collette. Together, Nicholas and Will help each other to become the men they want to be.This story could have been a predictable retelling of the innumerable romantic comedies that it resembles. However, the courage not to sugar coat the characters makes this film one of the better films of 2002. The directors, Chris and Paul Weitz, better known for their sophomoric hit comedy American Pie, demonstrate that they are a new force is humor films. The style of the film is straight forward and unremarkable, but it is this very clean style that allows a good cast to tell a story of charming humanity.Hugh Grant, long known for his English Fop roles continues to grow as an actor, like he did in Bridget Jones's Diary, to being able to play roles of depth and subtlety. Newcomer Nicholas Hoult gives a remarkable performance. I often cringe when watching what qualifies a child acting in films following in the wake of the rise of the dreadful Macaulay Culkin. However, Nicholas Hoult is an adult and professional actor in the body of a twelve year old boy. Finally, Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding, The Sixth Sense) proves once again, that she can take on characters with such expertness and skill that she is one of the film world's undiscovered diamonds.Now, this is not a deep film that illustrates some great revelation about the state of mankind. Nor is the script such that you won't know how this whole story will work out. But between the witty dialog and good performances, it will certainly leave you with a smile.

These are symptoms of the same disease. No man is an island. In the end of Fight Club Ed Norton realizes that no amount of consumer goods, cathartic violence, mayhem, and bloody male bonding can make up for the fact that what a man really needs is a good woman. He tells Marla at the end of the film while watching buildings explode You met me at a very strange point in my life. Likewise, in the end of About a Boy Hugh Grant realizes that no amount of material things and solitary comforts can take the place of the friendships and meaningful romantic relationships that are needed to live a happy life. Both of these men were living in compartmental, single serving, units of time, worlds that were empty and void of meaning.Okay, the Fight Club comparisons aside, this was a surprisingly charming and astute romantic comedy with a biting wit and deft sentimental touch. I hadn't been this pleasantly pleased by such a lightweight film since Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous. This is by far Hugh Grant's best performance to date, and this is a rare comedy that has some emotional depth and uplifting things to say about human relationships. What makes this even more surprising is that this came from the Weitz brothers, who previously gave us the only marginally funny and excruciatingly immature American Pie films. This is the perfect romantic comedy for people who hate romantic comedies. A real charmer all around.

And it's about the fate one embraces whenever a person trades his or her precious freedom for the claims a relationship makes on one's privacy.  Will, the main character, is an archetypal man in this respect  he wants to remain an island, the lord of his own personal domain, while also having relationships with women &#150; if only for sex.  Unfortunately for Will, that isn't possible.  Why?  Speaking as a man who's been through the pea patch a few times, it's because women make the rules.  There's no negotiation, appeasement, or qualification.  It's better to accept it without murmur.  But, valiant man that Will is, he tries his best to beat the odds, to be the only man in human history who has ever achieved both his freedom, and a steady supply of feminine relationships, simultaneously.  I must say, I admired his tenacity.  At one point of the movie, I thought he'd cracked the nut.  Completely by chance, he accepts a date with a single mom.  It's everything he ever hoped for  passionate sex, a regular ego massage, and an easy breakup.  Bingo!  He discovered the mother lode!But then, a number of chance occurrences intervene to totally change his fate &#150; the fate of being an island, which he chose for himself.  And just like real life, chance events show themselves as fate's very own calling card  everything that occurs of necessity, is expected, or is the product of a person's imagination, is powerless to reach our souls.  Chance is the Janus face of fate.  What I love about this movie is its absurdity  Chance in the absolute presents itself to Will in the guise of a twelve-year old boy.  And it's this wild incongruity that really gives this film it's pithy but warm sense of humor.

Here he stars (freed, finally, from the yoke of having to submerge himself alongside such aggressive egos as Julia Roberts and Renee Zellweger) as an independently wealthy bachelor forced to grow up when a desperate twelve-year-old boy (an endearing Nicholas Hoult) enters his life, enlisting him to help the boy's troubled mother (Toni Colette). It's clear that Grant without question is committed to his role and this infectious attitude carries over to the rest of the cast and the directors, brothers Chris and Paul Weitz, and what you have is a delicately balanced, elegantly crafted studio presentation that entertains even when it messes up--which the screenplay (by the Weitz brothers and Peter Hedges) and the pointed camerawork does quite frequently.

Funny how you don't hear those same people in Hollywood cheering for `About A Boy' this year, though it finally proves that playboy Hugh Grant is a real star and not just a pretty face with a good agent.  Sadly enough, `About A Boy' is a film that you tell your friend about and despite being a Hugh Grant fanatic, she's oblivious to it's existence.  It can only mean that Hollywood would rather invest in toilet humor and sequels of now rotten films, than back originality thats fit for the entire family.  Possible SpoilersIs it really possible that a few short years ago, the directors of this far superior film were destroying their reputations with the American Pie debacle?  It goes to show you that even the most clueless directors can turn mediocrity into brilliance when the public whom they cater to, desires it.  Who knew that they had this level of talent or that they'd be intelligent enough to adapt `About A Boy' from the author of the also fabulous `High Fidelity,' another sleeper hit from 2000.   `About A Boy' is actually about two boys who find that puberty is an unfortunate calamity.  For Will (Grant) puberty presents the problem of coming to terms with the conclusion that `no man is an island.'  There is a sort of brilliance in casting Grant in this role as one has to believe that he's basically playing himself.Toni Collette continues to churn out great roles but she never receives the credit given to names like Julia Roberts and Nicole Kidman.  Most people remember her from `The Sixth Sense' (if at all) but I'd say that it's highly unlikely that they'd recall her starring role in `Muriel's Wedding.'  As vegetarian hippie mom Fiona, Collette does some of her best work.Nicholas Hoult could be the next child star going the route of Anna Paquin, Tatum O'Neal, and Haley Joel Osment.  I really enjoyed the KidzRock scenes with Grant and Hoult, who proves that he's not one of the movie/sitcom kids who goes upstairs never to be seen again while mom and dad engage in their usual banter.  I think that if he continues to choose the right roles and finds an adequate hairstyle, he'll be the next superstar.`About A Boy' really surprised me.  I came in expecting another vehicle where Hugh Grant falls in love despite his caddish ways and was surprised that instead the chemistry was between Grant and a pubescent, needy child.  Scenes with the KidzRock contest, the duck situation, and the mother who loved it when her son sang for her were brilliant and inspired.

This role he did, I think, was better than what he played in Bridget Jones.At first, the two narrations between Will and the boy was a bit confusing, but it gave the movie an interesting twist to hear their thoughts.

These are all actors who won Oscars for their direction of a film. There's a great difference between directors and filmmakers. There are those such as Ridley Scott who can stage a great spectacle with thousands or extras and gigantic sets, lavish costumes but ignore directing the actors or the characters' intent.Two things that they teach student directors at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts are (1) Don't downplay to your audience, and (2) Never underestimate your audience's intelligence. The last few films I've seen, including About A Boy, Eye See You (D-Tox) and Signs, I've waited until the DVD came out to see the full versions and the things that the director or editor thought that we, the audience, didn't need to see or else we couldn't understand or wouldn't appreciate the footage that they decided to crop off and leave on the cutting room floor.Hell, the movie is only 101 minutes including the opening and closing credits. Ten more minutes of the deleted scenes (shown on the DVD) would NOT have bored us and probably would have filled in the gaps on a lot of scenes and fine acting that theatrical audiences who paid seven bucks never got or will get to see.  This director was not a young kid, but so often these new directors fresh out of film school with a great propensity for angles, camera angles, CG, effects, and etc. forget that sometimes even the best actors need some direction. These young directors have no concept of directing actors. They know how to set up a scene to shoot and if it doesn't meet their quality of filmmaking, well, just delete it. They think it will bore the audience.Movies should be more about storytelling not just visual film shooting. No director should direct until he knows something about acting or scriptwriting. He thinks a scene is too long and we, the audience, will not care for long static scenes of acting. God! Have they never been to the theatre and seen a three act play with only two characters and one set?...And yet something this simple can hold an audience's attention for two and a half hours! About A Boy is a wonderful film. 'Tis a pity, for it could have been a greater and much better film if the deleted scenes were included.The best example I can think to prove my point is the film version of The Fantasticks which ran for 30 years Off-Broadway. Most moviegoers have either seen it or acting in a production of it. The movie was so bad it wouldn't even open in the theaters! But then you buy the DVD and find that the deleted scenes and songs cut from the film run longer than the actual film that was released.  I would invite you to view the DVD of About A Boy and see one of Hugh Grant's finest, restrained performances, but then go to the Special Features and view the deleted scenes and listen to the flimsy excuses the filmmakers say as why they cut the scenes.  Too bad they didn't go to the AADA and learn the two basic fundamentals about direction!

About a Boy is actually about two boys.But while the story is cliche, the mastery is in the details.  Nicholas Hoult is good, and doesn't play the stereotypical sappy kid who's more mature than the adults; he's messed up.  Hugh Grant plays the part well, not a Walter Matthau type-grouch, but someone who is not indecent, just astonished that other people actually have feelings and needs.

But after a series of meetings and a little scheming by Marcus to hook Will up with his mother played by Toni Collette, both find themselves needing the other.  Their worlds are rocked and soon, Will finds himself unable to continue his bachelor life as before based on units of 1 or 30 mins.

The film ends with Will spending Christmas dinner with Rachel and Will and his mum.  And this is all because of a boy.  Although the movie is a dramatic-comedy if there is such a thing, it tends to move slowly and we do see their relationship developing over periods of probably months.

Most often, people fall in love hastily without the believability associated with the development of the characters.  Furthermore, many screenplays are dreadfully trite with common one-liners that could be used in a variety of other romances.This, however, is not the case with About a Boy.  Intelligently casted, Hugh Grant is the highlight of the movie, portraying a playboy with poised and confidence, while being a scholar of the apprehensions of committing to a substantial relationship from the insights of the young, remarkable, and precocious Nicholas Hoult in this wonderful coming of age story.  The script is well written and suited best for Grant, who is should be worthy of an Oscar nomination, while the supporting ensemble of Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz make the acting quite enjoyable.

Seeing as I had absolutely no time to see the film on its original theatrical release, I rented it on DVD and boy oh boy did I kick myself afterwards, for I have missed the communal laughter and warmth that seeing this film with a cinematic audience would have brought me.There must be so many other reviews here at IMDB that I will not bother detailing the plotline (slack!). However, the comedy of the transformation of, Will, the main character, from an insanely self-centered man-child to a man who is willing to give up all of his dignity for a child's happiness (won't give away anything here!) is surprisingly well directed by the directors of the original gross out teen comedy series American Pie, the Weitz brothers. The directors must have crossed seas here because the film is delightfully funny in a subtle way (as British comedies are).The acting is flawless. Led by Hugh Grant (Will), whom some comment is the modern Cary Grant (well, both of them being British and all), is a champion player of the romantic comedy. His delivery is subtle, classy and he looks extremely natural; New comer Nicholas Hoult gives a sincere and honest performance as the young boy Marcus; Toni Collette, whom doesn't seem to ever give a bad performance, is touching as well as funny playing Marcus' suicidal mother Fiona; and Rachel Weisz cameos late in the film as Will's first real love, Rachel.Underscoring the film with effective, originally composed contempoary music that suits the moods of the movie well is the artist Badly Drawn Boy.About a Boy is a warm, honest, sincere, and genuninely laugh-out-loud film which will really make you think about how you live your life.10 points!

As is the case with most movies that started out as books, the book was much better, but in the end, the movie is a decent carbon copy. It basically is that, besides the fact that they left out a lot of the story with Marcus' father and Marcus' budding relationship with Ellie. It seemed as tho they thought they had to Ellie in the movie somewhere so threw her in real quick and dropped it. That was disappointing, because I think Marcus' relationship with Ellie and the visit to his father's house was a big reason why he finally figured out that he would be okay. Aside from that, the movie had all the book had, and it was executed very well. I like Grant as Will, he did a really good job, and the kid who plays Marcus, I must admit I have no idea what his name is (Nick maybe?) was also very good. He has the role of Marcus down perfectly in my opinion, and he had a really good chemistry with Grant. Hugh Grant, despite the public embarassment he suffered some years ago is a really likeable guy, and a very likeable character for the most part, no matter what the role may be. He's cool and slick as Will, and it works.  Collette is perfect for the role of Marcus' mother. I honestly couldn't stand her in the movie, which was the point.

The problem for the one who actually makes the film is quite different, of course. For this film (and also for High Fidelity) the problem seems to be how to convey Hornby's flavour on film. And the solution is always the same voice off. In High Fidelity it wasn't off actually, for the actor spoke to camera, but that's just a trick. In this case, we hear characters thoughts in first person (in the book is on third quite a difference) and that's where all the fun comes from. Once again, it's Hornby who deserves credit and though I've liked and laughed a lot, it seems to me this About A Boy on screen lacks something to be a good film and not a good transposition.

Hugh Grant is once again brilliant in a film that shows how complex and easy it can be to commit to someone. This is another one of those funny British films of our time that both men and women should appreciate. Will is a 38-year-old rich, child-free, hip and irresponsible Londoner. Will spends most of his time hanging out at restaurants and dating women with no intention of committing to a permanent relationship. After a fling with a single mother, he discovers that a good place to meet women is at single-parent help groups. Inventing a toddler son called Ned, he joins a local group and is well on the way to seducing Susie, when he meets 12-year-old Marcus, the son of Susie's friend Fiona. After this, Will's life changes in many different ways. It has been along time since I have seen a movie quite like &#145;about a boy'. I really enjoyed the storyline, although I warn that it is complicated for one of a better word. I found the way the story was told, by both the acting and the voiceovers of the two main characters to be excellent. This aspect to the film was not only funny, but also original, as not many films dictate what should be happening, while the opposite is actually happening. Most of the credit for the way this and the whole movie was put forward must got to both the directors, the Weitz brothers, Paul and Chris. Considering that the two had a part in the outrageous &#145;American Pie' movie(s), I felt they both did an extremely good job with &#145;about a boy'.Then what about the cast of this film! Hugh Grant has had a funny career, with of course his big hits being &#145;Notting Hill' and &#145;Bridget Jones Diary'. Yet in this, he is given a very diverse and complex character to play. Not only is he a very boring person, he is a nobody. He wants no part in a committed relationship, believing that &#145;it is not for me'. He rather enjoys toying with many women's emotions. Grant was born for this role of Will, a single bloke who wants no commitment, to spoil what he thinks is a perfect life. Yet his character learns plenty from a young and &#145;down and out', 12 year old Marcus. In fact they both teach each other important values for life. Marcus tries to help Will grow up and be a real man, and commit to a woman, while Will attempts to show Marcus what it means to be &#145;cool'. Acting newcomer Nicholas Hoult plays Marcus. I found him to be of great value to this film, as he brings out the good in Will. In addition he does a wonderful job in his first movie role. The way both Nicholas and Grant perform onscreen together was another highlight for me. I must not forget the other great members to this cast. Aussie Toni Collette is great as the depressed mother of Marcus. The way she portrays Fiona, is so frighteningly good. Trust me I know what it is like to feel as Fiona did in this film! In fact her role brings back memories of her character in the &#145;Sixth Sense'. I also found the small performance by Rachel Weisz suited this film well. Her character is of great importance to the balance of the story being presented.I would also like to point out that &#145;about a boy' poses some important values for its audience. Yes, most men can be like &#145;islands' and they can be scared to commit and love women as they are. It is important to not let someone slip away or for something to stuff you up, when that is the last thing you really want. Both of the main characters show this to be so true.So please watch &#145;about a boy', learn from it, be touched by it and laugh at it. All of these components are crucial to the film, making it one of my favourite films of this year. Also if you are single and have someone special in your life, take a chance with him or her, as you might regret not doing this for the rest of your life.

This isn't a romance movie, nor a teenage movie, it is jsut simply a movie about growing up as we witness the journey of the relationship between Marcus (Nicholas Hault, who is very impressive) and a very funny Will (Hugh Grant, who has funny one liners).There isn't much to say about the film, but I was disappointed to see the screen time given to Rachel Weisz, it wasn't until half of the film that you actually see the lovely Rachel Weisz. Her relationship with Will is also lazy and disappointing.But really, the film's focus was the relationship with Marcus and Will.

His house looks like a Sharper Image catalog and he drives an Audi TT, but his friends, who are all married with children, keep asking him if he wants anything more out of life. One couple asks him to be their child's godfather, and Will suggests that that would be a really bad idea.Will gets set up with a woman who turns out to be a single mother, which surprisingly turns out pretty well for him when she breaks up with him just as he starts to tire of her (he's never had a relationship last longer then two months). So he invents an imaginary son and attends a group meeting for single parents. As a result, he eventually meets Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), who is a 12 year old boy. His mother (Toni Collette) is a vegetarian hippy who dresses Marcus funny, but he loves her anyway. He ends up taking a liking to Will, and the bulk of the film revolves around them. A great deal of the narrative is carried in the form of voice overs by the characters, which works but may take you a little out of the film after a while.The acting is good. This is perhaps the most interesting role I can recall Hugh Grant playing, since he begins the film as a proudly shallow man and evolves, in fits and starts, over the course of the film. Nicholas Hoult does a convincing job of portraying a child who doesn't really fit in anywhere. Toni Collette, as my wife pointed out, is under utilized, but is still good. All in all, the film presents an interesting set of characters that I was glad to have had a chance to meet.One interesting technique which I don't recall being used before was what I would call a pan cut. The film pans from one scene to another, so that in the middle of the pan the left half of the frame is a different scene than the right half. I guess it's just a wipe, except with the camera movement of a pan. I imagine that it was probably done digitally.The film is based on a novel by Nick Hornby, who also wrote High Fidelity. In the early parts of this film, I was really enjoying myself and felt that it was in the same league, but in the end it didn't feel as complete somehow. But since that's a pretty high standard, I would definitely still recommend this film.

The script compliments the classic Hornby sense of articulate Londoners driven by obsessive-compulsive pursuits. The peculiar creative powers behind the project turn out genuinely amusing and consistently entertaining film that boasts nicely rounded and amiable characters. By avoiding the syrup the picture doesn't fall into a predictable groove. It manages to avoid the banality of majority mainstream Hollywood romantic comedies but, regretfully, lacks the underlying philosophical concept(the brilliant GroundHog Day) that could elevate it to a classic.There are two significant London-centered trilogies that originated in the 1990s. One - the Richard Curtis triptych of Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones's Diaries - has Hugh Grant starring in all of them. The other is the Nick Hornby trilogy of Fever Pitch, High Fidelity and About a Boy. Unlike in overpraised High Fidelity, in which Stephen Frears, its British director (with John Cusack, a manic American equivalent to Grant) transferred that novel's plot from London to Chicago, the book's London setting is preserved here (apparently Chris Weitz has a first-hand understanding of English culture acquired during his studies at Cambridge).About a boy - the name is a take on Nirvana's 'About a girl' - could have been titled just the same About Two Boys. It is in essence a coming-of-age story squared. Not only is it about the smug and egocentric slacker and idle wealthy bachelor, Will Freeman, a character played by Grant, it is also about a pubescent loner dork, Marcus. Murcus' problems stem from his New Agey and seriously depressive mother who wishes to impose her rigid 1980s counter-cultural conformity on her son. Through his unlikely accord with Marcus, the story's catalyst, Will is eventually dragged kicking and screaming into the human race. Solipsists may be plugged into popular culture but they surely are utterly detached from actual people. 'Every man is an island' (Will lives his life as if his were Ibiza, a trendy European summertime playground ), but more often than not islands are invisibly connected into archipelagos. Island living may guarantee happy seclusion - 'Freeman' is all Will ever wants to be - but it also offers solitude and emotional retardation. The Will Show - aided by a series of great voice-over, self-satisfied pop referencing riffs - becomes an ensemble drama. A cad ultimately is turned into a lad.Will's life springs into uncharted territory with the discovery of a brand new world of attention-starved single moms waiting to be conquered. Commitment is the enemy and single moms make good lays. Single mothers are less demanding and easier to dump than single girls. He infiltrates SPAT - Single Parents Alone Together - a pick-up heaven of perfect dating prey.Much of the film's success comes from Will Freeman's flashy politically incorrect characterization. He is a selfish b*****d, in love with his lifestyle carefully scheduled into units, with specific numbers of them allotted for one-night stands, expansive haircuts, cd-shopping, and watching TV game shows (It is not impossible that Hollywood may take notice of this phenomenon, leave studio cowardice aside and instead of endless and repetitive stream of anemic parts give us more colorful and unconventional characters). Hugh Grant brings Will's character to life in a grand manner. His versatile facial vocabulary, always with the hint of an edge, is fully tapped. Most male stars tend to be judged by their actions or the values they embody. With Grant, it is all about seeing thoughts and emotions cross and transform his face. Here, more subtly and convincingly than ever before. In About a Boy, Grant is more than a star, he is a resource.With this handsome production The Weitz Bro's are now giving Cameron Crowe a run for his mainstream pop money.

It has a broad appeal, and will draw you in from the opening moment if you give it even the slightest of chances. I loved the book and was wary, like so many others, of how the adaptation would work. Well, they did a brilliant job, beginning with the casting of Hugh Grant.I'm not really a fan of Grant sure he was entertaining in Four Weddings, but his stock, foppish English-upper-class act got stale very quickly. Clearly he allowed himself to be stereotyped too early in his career. Well it seems as though he's turned a corner with the role of Will in `About a Boy.' Gone (or at least muted) are the mannerisms that I used to find annoying. Here he uses his hands, eyes and facial expressions in more subtle ways, and to great effect. He also plays a much more realistic, flawed character &#150; and believably so. From now on I think the name Hugh Grant will draw me to movies rather than put me off them.What can I say about Nicholas Hoult as Marcus except to echo what so many others have said &#150; what an astoundingly convincing performance! He conveys very well the innocent honesty of a boy forced to grow up too fast in a world with which he isn't really in synch. He was aggravating when the plot called for it, tight-lipped at the right times, awkward in the best traditions of early adolescence, winning and off-putting like any youngster (or adult for that matter). He impressed me most in his interactions with his screen mother, in the scene where he explains to Will in a heartbreakingly matter-of-fact tone how he copes with his misfit existence, and in his encounter with Rachel's son Ali. In fact I don't think he puts a foot wrong in the whole movie. In my opinion Nicholas Hoult absolutely nailed the character.Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz do wonders with roles that are, admittedly, under-written. Let's face it, `About a Boy' is the Will (& Marcus) Show. That's just how Hornby wrote it. But both actresses give their characters as much depth as the movie's constraints allow. Collette's Fiona is perhaps an unlikely portrait of the average single mother suffering from mental illness, but she convinces us because she is so sincere &#150; in a movie with so many laughs, you can't help feeling moved by her tears or her expressions of affection for her son. And Weisz, despite having an even smaller part, is no less convincing in her interactions with Hugh Grant's character.Add to the mix Augustus Prew's brief but extraordinary performance as Ali and the sweet and sour character of Ellie so ably performed by Nat Gastiain Tena, then you have perhaps the best ensemble cast in any movie made so far this year, and perhaps the best we're likely to see in all of 2002!

Will is a self-absorbed confirmed bachelor living comfortably in his very chic, very roomy London flat.  As Will is occasionally forced to admit, he really does nothing for a living; his lifestyle is funded by the royalties he receives as a result of a very popular novelty Christmas song penned years ago by his father.Will lives his life as an island, careful to avoid the personal entanglements that would require him to shift his focus from himself.  He shops, he watches TV, he plays billiards, and he dates lots of women.  In his frequent, short-lived relationships, Will is able to take on whatever role he needs to become Mr. Right for a time.  Unfortunately, he can maintain each charade for only so long before he has to call it off, and then he is thrust into the most uncomfortable and very unwelcome role of bad guy.Will soon discovers what he believes to be an untapped source of commitment-free relationships single moms.  Will invents a son for himself, and finagles himself a date through a support group for single parents. On his `date' he meets Marcus (Hoult), the painfully nerdy son of aging hippie, Fiona (Colette).Marcus initially latches onto Will as a potential husband for his mom; Fiona is emotionally erratic, and Marcus desperately wants to see her happy. The `magic', as they say, is just not there for Will and Fiona.  However, Marcus continues to visit Will's flat on his own, as an escape from the constant taunting at school and the emotional roller coaster at home.Will is initially resistant to this infringement on his insular existence, but he eventually begins to accept the visits and actually starts to interact with Marcus.  As Marcus becomes more of a fixture in Will's life, it slowly dawns on Will that he actually does care about somebody else's happiness Marcus'.Hugh Grant really makes this movie.  He is delightfully shallow and cynical as Will, managing to step beyond his traditional role of the bumbling, hapless, hopeless romantic.

His relationships with women never last more than two months &#150;with no job or proper relationship, Will has never had any need for responsibility.  This changes when he joins a single parent group (Will does not have a child but he uses the group's meetings as a scheme for meeting single women).  At a single parent group picnic, he is brought into contact with Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) a twelve year old who lives alone with his suicidal mother (Toni Collette) and is bullied regularly at school.  The film tells the story of how friendship develops between man and boy.In this film, we have a hip and cool Hugh Grant he has a new short haircut and trendier clothes.  Yet again, he comes across on screen as extremely likeable and it is difficult to imagine anyone else playing the part of Will.  One problem I had was difficulty in warming to Nicholas Hoult's performance.  He is a pretty average actor and I suspect that we are unlikely to see him on screen again.  Since the story is all about the relationship between Will and Marcus, Grant has a lot to carry and he simply is not provided sufficient support to make the film as a sure-fire comedy classic as it would initially appear on paper.  The film uses narrative voice-over by the two principle actors which serves to replace Nick Hornby's written word.  This seems unnecessary at times and I often found the voice-overs an irritation, particularly in the case of Hoult who fails to convince with his emotions. I had high expectations for the cinematic adaptation of Nick Hornby's novel and I think my familiarity with the book is probably the reason why I left the cinema feeling slightly disappointed.

He is funny, obnoxious and touching all within the span of 100 minutes.  His character is generation X and is just about as real as it gets.  He's a 38 year old rich guy living off the royalties of a one hit wonder song his father wrote years ago.  He dates and dumps women without a care for their feelings, he lounges at home watching videos and getting drunk and stoned while doing it, plays pool, and has his hair cut by sexy hair dressers.  Then he befriends a boy about 12 who is more manly than he is and teaches him to be a responsible adult.  The film intertwines broken families with the reality of single parenthood and the pros of cons of bachelorhood and the eventual decision that may not always be one of choice but rather one of destiny.  A wonderful film that finds humour in places you wouldn't expect it to be.  Not something new but certainly something a lot of people can relate to.  You have to like that. "}{"Title":"You need backup","Date":"30 May 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" About a Boy from directors Chris and Paul Weitz is the best movie of the year so far. It is a bold romantic comedy that has something to say, and whose transformation of it's lead character, Will, played by Hugh Grant in perhaps his best work, is so satisfying and touching. The screenplay by Peter Hedges, Chris and Paul Weits, based on the novel by Nick Hornby is smart, funny, and politically incorrect--which I love. Hedges and the Weitzes take on such topics as single parenting, suicide, and school peer pressure with an edge and always a sense of humor. Hugh Grant plays Will, 38 years old, single, and does nothing for a living. He watches TV, drives around in his Audi TT, and has vapid relationships with beautiful women. He lives off the royalties of a song that father wrote years ago. He tells two of his friends who want him to be their daughter's godfather, Yes, I really am this shallow. Contrary to John Dunne or is Jon Bon Jovi... Will is an island. He maybe shallow, and he is having a grand time. Will even stumbles upon a new dating community single mothers. That's how Will meets 12 year old Marcus (played by an excellent Nicholas Hoult). Will goes on a picnic with a single mom who is looking after Marcus. Marcus wears dreary clothes, and sports a bad haircut. Marcus is everything that Will is not, uncool and possessing depth of character. Marcus's mom Fiona (played by Toni Collette) attempts suicide and ends up in the hospital for a spell. Then it occurs to Marcus that having two people are not enough (i.e. he and his Mom). What happens when one is gone? You need back up. Marcus is smart. The back up is Will. Marcus invites himself over to Will's everyday. The beautiful thing of it all is that Will really doesn't change all that much. He teaches Marcus about being cool, and Marcus teaches Marcus about having integrity, and ultimately doing what is important. This is put to the test when Will meets an awesome single mom, Rachel (played by Rachel Weisz), with whom he would like to spend his life, and asks Marcus to pretend that he is his son. About a Boy is about No man is an island. Life is funny, sad, and inspiring all at the same time. What's valuable is a sense of integrity and community. The end of the movie is sentimental and truly heart felt. Hugh Grant gives a stellar performance. He is so believable as the guy who really doesn't care about people, and finally gets that people are the only important thing. This is something that I relate to totally. Grant plays it smart and uncompromising which makes poignant Will's fall and triumph. This is Grant best work. Nicholas Hoult as Marcus is just perfect. He is so natural, and captures a young boy's suffering and joy. Hoult makes believable Marcus's wisdom which he teaches by example to Grant's Will. Toni Collette is great as Marcus's mother, who finally gets a clue. Rachel Weisz's Rachel is perfect as the woman Will falls in love with.Also kudos for the movie dealing with suicide and it's cost with an uncompromising edge, a sense of humor, and compassion. About a Boy is truly awesome work by all involved.

Makes good movie!","Date":"29 May 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Despite the obvious sarcasm above, I felt this was one of Hugh Grant's best acting efforts; and all in all, a film with surprising depth, charm and meaning. One might be tempted to call it a romantic comedy, but I think it would be more appropriate to call it a slice-of-life-type film that happens to contain good-sized dollops of romance and humor. Hugh Grant, as a true ne'er-do-well, lives off of royalties generated by an inane but successful Christmas song written by his father. He lives an admittedly meaningless life.  He's never worked seriously at anything, including relationships.  Then he discovers single moms ... and despite himself, begins to grow up. Saying much more about the plot does little to explain why I think this movie is a must-see; rather, let's observe that Grant shows true subtlety (rather than vacuousness as he sometimes does.) He also shows us a character we really don't like at first --- and still realize is flawed, even at the end.  But he finally learns he is 'not an island,' and the trip getting there is worth hitching up to. All others, including the boy that the title refers to (I forget his name) offer solid supporting roles, and the direction is crisp and interesting; this could have been a movie with long yawn stretches, but it kept my interest throughout. Moreover, it is a movie that discusses a very pertinent post-modernist question are we really islands?  I think you'll discover yourself pondering the movie's message for days afteward. "},{"Title":"Almost a great movie, but still a really good one","Date":"28 May 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I'd really like to give this an 8, but I can't get over how disjointed the directing, camerawork and/or editing were in so many scenes; I think I've got to give it a really high 7. The writing is TERRIFIC (although we really aren't surprised by anything in the plot), and the actors are first-rate - virtually without exception. This is perhaps Hugh Grant's best performance, and the other actors - particularly the numerous younger actors - really couldn't be better. But I couldn't help feeling that they couldn't quite decide how to shoot a lot of the scenes, because in a few pivotal scenes (Toni Collette's confrontation with Grant late in the film, for example), they kept cutting back and forth between about 4 or 5 camera angles. I know it seems like nitpicking but it really annoyed me while watching, almost to the point of having a disorienting effect. In another scene, the camera kept gliding back and forth between two actors across a table from one another, and I felt I was going to start getting seasick if it went on very long. Maybe they shot scenes from a lot of angles, and then tried to keep the best moments from all the different shots and it ended up getting really choppy; I really don't know. But I do know that I found most of the camerawork really uninspired, certainly much less so than in Notting Hill.The film was cut by the same editor (Nick Moore) who did Notting Hill and The Full Monty (both of which had a much smoother rhythm than this one), though I suspect he probably did the best with what he had.. The cinematographer (Remi Adefarasin) previously worked on a number of top projects, including Elizabeth (which also struck me as having too much overly busy camera movement), and Band of Brothers (on which he probably shot a ton of footage from countless angles). My best guess is that a couple of young directors (the Weitzes, coming off a really dreadful movie) got a little overwhelmed by a cinematographer who had all kinds of ideas about camera tricks and angles. They would have been better served if they had calmed it down a little. Again, a top-notch 7 of 10 - ALMOST an 8. "},{"Title":"I couldn't have written this without seeing it","Date":"28 May 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Critics who have seen many more films than I agree that this is among the smartest, most delightful comedies of this or any recent year.  Especially refreshingly, this distinction comes the old-fashioned way with a solid and intelligent script, fine acting, and direction with a sense of-- well, direction.  We see an honest, intimate comedy of manners, with no overlay of untoward pretentions like flashy special effects or a budget to vie with third-world countries.Furthermore, its release date is a fittingly cheeky gesture itself, juxtaposing this tidy little work of art with its opposite, a sprawling, spectacular episode of Star Wars.  The world is, alas, not always a reasonable place, but there is no *reason* why it should thereby suffer from its competition at the hands of anyone who attends more than one movie per season.  There are various sorts of good movie. If perchance two are showing simultaneously, is it too much to expect that we see one and return for the other next weekend, blessing our good fortune and storing up such unaccustomed pleasure in one's hump?  Treks between the desert's oases seem to lengthen over time.But now to differ a little with the critics I even sympathized with the character of Will.  A blank? Yes, seemingly he is.  But a bastard, whom audiences love to hate? Where have folks been since 9/11? First do no harm is a similarly blank, or negative precept, yet as a basic ethical hurdle it fells many even whom we don't usually love to hate.  I suggest beginning with it.Will stands in the tradition of generations of ladies and gentlemen of leisure who live quietly in their homes and let others do likewise. Further, awhile back we all might have enjoyed the reminiscent comedies of, say, Noel Coward, who portrayed such with a smile, complete with equally creative strategems to beguile the opposite sex.  As for us, typically we save up because by age 65-- or 60 if we can possibly manage-- our life's ambition is to attain to Will's situation; whereas he is, shall we say, retired at 38. There gapes the gulf between us.Yeah, Will likes his sports car (although not too much to consign it to a daft woman when rushing out to save a daft boy), but apparently he doesn't habitually burn up irreplaceable resources gallivanting around the world in jets or yachts.  Such self-indulgence, hardly confined to the leisure class anymore, irreversibly deprives all posterity of not only energy but plastic. Otherwise, money that passes through his albeit frivolous hands cyclically provides employment and livelihood to others, making his lifestyle no more malign than that of most Londoners.Meanwhile, Will schemes no scams to weasel into the wallets of unsuspecting fellow citizens.  He is not selling drugs.  He doesn't blow up buildings or teach kids to kill Jews under the pretext of some exotic religion.  We might wish that he weren't quite so stand-offish for so long towards the lonely and needy like Marcus (who, I agree, with most but not all, is nicer than Will).  But, then, to such lengths one must go nowadays to ensure that gestures towards the young aren't misunderstood.  Good-old Will even passes that test-- under the eagle eye of a mother who, over this issue, suddenly jolts herself out of her free-thinking, nostalgic, bipolar haze into a shocked vigilance, in the finest tradition of properly instructed, up-to-date 'parenting.'In the sense that these scenes don't fit her character, they don't work. But I bet the directors knew and intended this incongruity full well. Given the Stygian streams that cultural spelunkers James Kincaid and Judith Levine have mapped at last, and the ritual coin in the mouth for the boatman before contemporary audiences can sit back and enjoy an intergenerational relationship, theirs was so abrupt and blatent as to constitute satire.  As Marcus would trill, this stroke was brilliant! Quentin Crisp would agree, who advised if and when you must start going bald, the cool thing to do is shave your head.So, by today's real standards (i.e., divested of vestigial Marxist lip service), we have, er, what to hate in Will Freeman? Two generations ago we admired undisguised leisure and a modicum of independent wealth.  Now, our blue noses ever to whomever's grindstone, we affect to despise them.  If this change came from living in a society become generally freer, more just, more promising, and more gracious than then, I'd agree fair enough, goodbye and good riddance to Will and all his ilk.  But that is not what I see outside theaters.  Do you?Does the inferred distaste arise from the fact that-- unlike countless others who live too high on the hog to maintain straight-faced that they earn their keep, however chronically stressed-out they may become on behalf of their chosen standard-- Will is a *single man*? Does a T-shirt glimpsed in the film's first minutes say it all? Lorene Bobbitt for Surgeon General reads the chest of a woman obviously eager to proclaim her independence from men, but perhaps less eager to return men the favor.From Hollywood's ghoulies and ghosties, long-leggedy beasties, things that go bump in the night, and earnest turning-over-new-leaves by dramatically converted protagonists, good Lord deliver us, as the Weitzes have already done.  Not for them the conjuration of lightning flashes. Freemasonry, it is said, quietly takes good men and makes them better. Once he'd doggedly pounded his way in, 12-year-old Marcus quietly took a blank man and made him good.  I'm happy.  Maybe even, someday, Will Freeman Will Freemason, but that's another movie (always leave room for a sequel, in which he could even defy American-imperialist bugaboos enough to give Marcus a hug the next time the kid fears for his mother's life).  Meanwhile, both man and boy-- or is it both boys-- could do worse.  Like most movies.  "},{"Title":"The Urbane Jungle","Date":"27 May 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  About a Boy is the story of a superficial hipster who discovers his humanity, who comes to learn of his need and capability to love, through a paternal relationship to a troubled young boy.Even so, it's still worth watching.Will Freeman (get it?) is a London man-about-town who has raised superficiality to a form of high art.  He has no job, no interests, no close friends.  He lives off the royalties from a song his late father wrote years before (it's not a very good song, either, and watching Will's reaction as it stalks him everywhere he goes is a lot of fun).  Will's time is filled with nothing he watches TV, he has his hair done, he plays pool, he chases women, but he has no substantive existence.  And that's just how he likes it.He hits upon a scheme to focus his skirt-chasing on young single mothers, who are eager for male attention but skittish about emotional commitment.  This plan brings him into contact with 12-year-old Marcus, a bright but miserable kid who divides his time between torture at school and his unstable home life with his hippie mom (Toni Collette).  Marcus decides he needs a backup support system, and schemes by persistence and blackmail to recruit Will as a surrogate father.The scenario lends itself to being a kind of post-modern Parent Trap cute kid brings together two people who are just so gosh-darn perfect for each other that the only reason they aren't together is that they have to drag it out so the audience can finish its popcorn.  But this movie refuses to follow any easily-spotted pattern, and there are too many other characters and relationships spinning in its orbit anyway.  About a Boy takes any number of relationship comedy ideas, any one of which could have its own pedestrian high-concept movie built around it, and mixes them , blender-like, into its narrative.  It keeps all these balls in the air by maintaining an extremely sharp and witty edge.  In the saccharine world of change-your-heart movies, it's a big shot of insulin.  But in being so, it manages to beat the sweeties at their own game its moments of emotional weight are all the more effective because we're not under constant empathy fatigue.To look at Hugh Grant, even in the movies where he plays insufferably cute, is to see a man who could brilliantly portray a rat fink, since he seems to have a lot of experience (just ask Elizabeth Hurley).  And his Will is a virtuoso of callow self-involvement.  He doesn't kid himself; he is content in his shallowness, as his caustic and funny narration makes clear (being that empty apparently requires a great deal of self-knowledge).  It is this narration that is one of the best parts of Grant's performance his onscreen reactions are in perfect synch with his offscreen words, which makes his internal monologue a vital part of the movie instead of a clunky device.  Grant expertly walks a tightrope between pathos and obnoxiousness, since if he were too likable or too nasty, he wouldn't hold our interest the way he does.Naturally, Will's shallowness is a mask for some deep and roiling emotions that he refuses to deal with, regarding his father and his upbringing (and that freakin' song).  This is nicely understated we are never subjected to teary emotional confessions or wrenching anecdotes on his part.As Marcus, Nicholas Hoult creates a presence to match Grant's.  The boy is both smart and troubled, but they don't become the kind of overbearing cardinal traits that usually dominate and define children in movies.  His most prominent characteristic is a kind of morose calculation he doesn't gravitate toward Will out of sentiment or affection, but just decides that he needs some backup and figures that, realistically, Will is what he has to work with.  And work he does the movie lets us watch as a relationship based on mutually beneficial deceit gradually and almost defiantly becomes real and deep.  Hoult's interior monologue is almost as funny as Grant's.  It reveals a kid who has grown up fast, who is wry and self-aware but still, and palpably, just a kid.As Marcus's mom, Toni Collette sheds the maternal seriousness and scientific stare that have become a sort of trademark for her in movies like Changing Lanes and The Sixth Sense.  Her role isn't too big, but she gives us a compelling portrayal of loving but freaked-out instability with the screen time she has.  Only Rachel Weisz fails to make much impression, as a love interest of Grant's she's not bad, but it's tough playing a late-coming and slightly underwritten character, when everyone around you is so good.The script by Nick Hornby and Peter Hedges is clever and fast-moving, so much so that at the end of the movie, you are impressed by the sheer amount of things that happen in About a Boy.  Directors Chris and Paul Weitz (the American Pie guys!) keep things going at a brisk pace, with a minimum of showy camera work, though there is a rotating pan of Hoult in the schoolyard that is beautifully executed and well-placed.  It deftly evokes self-involved urban cool, the terrors of junior high, the pain of missing pieces in your life, and the peculiar joys of families, ersatz and otherwise.  Though the story strains its own believability at times (it's hard to figure how Grant gets into all these parties if he doesn't know anyone and just mostly watches TV), it charms its way to forgiveness, or at least acceptance.  Its lessons are familiar, but nicely rendered  Everybody needs backup.  Everybody has something to offer other people.  And sometimes, you just have to get out there and sing Roberta Flack with your eyes closed.I'm pretty sure they meant that last part metaphorically.  No, seriously, stop that.  Please.

Repeat with feeling.No, not (only) most of the opening words of Four Weddings And A Funeral, but (also) the probable reaction on hearing that Hugh Grant was to play the part of Will, at least by those who've read the book. I haven't read any of Nick Hornby's work but even I can see that this was a terrible miscasting. Will is the very opposite of sympatico. No need to work (large inheritance), no social conscience, no emotional maturity, he's the kind of oafish boy-in-a-man's-body that we all love to despise. So whose bright idea was it to let Hugh Grant turn him into an apologetic moderately-charming young-man-in-need-of-some-competent-mothering? There must be dozens of actors better suited to the part. Neil Pearson sprang to my mind immediately, if only because Grant's voice-overs sounded quite like Pearson, which meant I could try to enjoy most of the film by mentally pasting Pearson over the top of Grant. I nearly succeeded, too, but for the major problem that this film shares with too many others, namely the schizophrenia of good actors in shallow parts.Nicholas Hoult turns in a highly watchable performance as Marcus (the other, younger Boy) and Toni Collette reminds us that she can be almost as chamaeleonic a performer as Nicole Kidman. (I know I'm not alone in suspecting that if Collette had allowed herself to be dragged into the Hollywood mainstream we would be benefitting from seeing her in much more interesting roles. Ok, she's not a looker, but then neither is Meryl Streep.) But I digress; their parts and those of others here are poorly fleshed. Perhaps this is a problem inherent in turning a piece of literature into visual entertainment a book can afford to spend a whole page describing someone's thoughts about a single short incident, whereas a film has to paint an overall impression in a few frames. Still, that's surely a poor excuse for central cardboard cut-out characters like the depressed leftie right-on organic single mother and the group of all men are bastards except for you 'cos you're a single father women, all carefully cast to be unattractive so of course they couldn't hang on to their men, they didn't deserve to did they?

Add an element of privilege, remove any trace of ambition and include a generous helping of self-reliance and you've got a character you love to hate. This man-child has just about all that's distasteful in the modern bachelor and the Peter Pan Syndrome has never been so well represented. Get the picture?Yet there's a hint of growth here.  Will has a new strategy to pursue more vulnerable women  pretend you're a single dad and join a support group since that's where the single moms hang. However, a few steps into this pond and Mr. Shallow is out of his depth. Most of these joiners don't fit the demographics Will seeks. But it's through SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) that he connects with the Boy Marcus (Nicholas Hoult).A wonderful screenplay keeps this film moving through the perilous quest that would undermine a lesser talent. Letting us into the thoughts of our hero (using voice-over) adds an unspoken monologue that tops his incredibly self-centered attitude. And he gets away with it. Marcus has his thoughts treated this way as well and here we see adolescent struggles with socialization, acceptance and responsibilities. Though 25 years separate the man and the boy, their struggles are the same. We sympathize with Marcus since these lessons are age appropriate for him. Will should have gotten past it long ago. Arrested development isn't an acceptable defense.Toni Collette sensitively plays the boy's suicidal mom.  Rachel Wiesz handles the role of the ultimate challenge (taming Will).'About a Boy' then is really about two boys, both seeking an identity that extends beyond their own needs and interests. How they do it is the substance of this film that deserves your time. Will realizes that relationships involving more than two members may have exponentially greater potential. Perhaps not in all cases, but this realization helps propel Will from boyhood. When you see this film, you'll be all About a Boy.

At first Will is taken back by the brazen nature of the boy but they eventually become good buddies. Marcus played by Nicholas Hoult gives a fine performance as the boy who is taunted at school and is also troubled by her mothers suicidal attempts.

Rachel Weisz was merely window dressing, her character is barely developed in this film (and frankly, I just didn't care about what was developed).Toni Collette was great as Fiona (Marcus's depressed and suicidal mother).Finally, Hugh Grant as Will is very believable as a jaded, self-centered, do-nothing louse (albeit a cute one). It was fun to watch him find love and laughter with a young and geeky boy who befriends him happenstance.There are a few subtle references to Will's own childhood that I would have liked to see more of. This is obviously the core cause of his current state of being, and yet the director only gives us hints and innuendo. You get a sense there is a deep sadness in Will, but it is never fully explored. Too bad actually, because I think it would have helped the audience relate more to Will. This film is definitely smarter than the pre-summer fluff that is currently dominating the theaters, but not genius smart.

So the movie finally came out.  I went and saw it.  My predictions were entirely wrong.  About a Boy blew me away.  It was beautifully put together; each frame was perfect.  Hugh Grant did a marvelous job, as did the rest of the cast.  Badly Drawn Boy's soundtrack is my new favorite album.  Although the book and the movie are different at parts, I feel that they altered the storyline so that it would be more plausible as a movie, which in my opinion is fine -- as long as Nick Hornby had a say in what was changed, which I'm sure he did.

If you've read the book and liked it, don't waste your time with this film.  First off, Hugh Grant, while perhaps a mediocre actor at best, simply is not the person to play Will.  He's not, as Hornby describes him Dry Ice cool.  He simply does not portray the image that Will's character requires. Also, if you like the plot line of the book, don't expect it in the film. The general principle is there, but halfway through the film it somehow gets lost.  This is mostly attributed to the small role that Ellie plays in the film versus the significant part which Hornby gives her. I guess the only part that I really liked about the film was the transformation of Ellie from a grunge queen/Nirvana freak to a punk.  In short, the Hornby feel of this movie is gone.  The film centers less around Will and thus alot of the cynical humor is gone, so the Hornby feel of the film simply isn't there.  My suggestion?  Save a few bucks and rent High Fidelity instead.

Unfortunately, light comedy/drama doesn't cut it with the Academy. To date, Colin Firth and John Cusack have taken shots at Nick's classic stunted emotional man trying to connect to real life without props (Pop, Arsenal, etc.) but Hugh's is the best. Toni Collette also did extremely well, making a role that could have been laughable have real resonance by the end. I think I enjoyed the film so much because, paradoxically, I didn't connect to the book the way I did to Fever Pitch and High Fidelity. I just took it as a movie, rather than as an adapted version of something very close to my heart. The only downside? It lost half a point for the guitar at school scene, which seemed to be pasted into the screenplay to give Will a chance to absorb humiliation on behalf of Marcus.

What appears to be another chick flick is a film that girls will want to go to and guys will be glad they came along.","Date":"17 May 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  What a delightful surprise! What appears to be a chick flick on the surface (complete with Hugh Grant as the male lead) turns out to be an enjoyable film that girls will love and dutiful boyfriends and husbands everywhere will be glad they went. Grant's slacker role is something that many guys can understand (if not relate to), where he just enjoys hanging out and doing nothing (playing video games, listening to music, and picking up random girls). Then along comes an awkward, yet likeable boy who becomes an unlikely friend and changes his life. Sound unlikely? Don't count this one out just yet. Directors Chris and Paul Weitz made the smart move from gross-out comedy after turning down the sequel to their wildly successful teen comedy American Pie. After almost being exiled for their Chris Rock vehicle Down To Earth, the brothers fought hard to direct the adaptation of the great book by Nick Hornby (High Fidelity), much to the dismay of Grant (and many other Brits). As it turns out, you'll probably be as pleased as he was. This warm and fuzzy British comedy isn't too fluffy but isn't too heavy, either. It comes off as very sincere and very funny. The score by Badly Drawn Boy fits perfectly and sets the tone for the pivotal scenes. The only awkward moment is musically, though. You'll hear Hugh Grant singing and playing guitar performing Killing Me Softly. Although it's meant to be odd, yet sweet, it's a little too much. Just like High Fidelity, the music is a very important part of the film and it should be duly noted.  Grant, Toni Collette, Rachel Weisz, and newcomer Nicholas Hoult all give fine performances and will please all Hornby fans as everyone knows how hard it is to watch a bad adaptation of a great book. Opening against the sequel to the last lackluster Star Wars movie, this may do well for everyone who doesn't believe the hype or gets shut out. As you may remember, Grant's Notting Hill was up against Phantom Menace and did quite well. Go check this one out and bring your significant other, no matter what the gender. This one is a definite crowd pleaser and is the best (safe) date movie in a while. Highly recommended.

As has been commented by several film critics already, it marks yet another step in Hugh Grant's evolution from charming fop roles that he so popularized in Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill. Of course,  now we may have to be concerned with his being typecast as the jerky Englishman...along with Toni Collette being typecast as the lonely single mom.Nicholas Hoult (Marcus) gave a very good performance in his first major film role.  His acting was believable and not at all trained.  Still, what I'm surprised at most of all is that the Weitz brothers (of American Pie and Here on Earth fame/infamy) directed this film.  The film was really quite excellently directed and a real testament to the fact that they can direct adult flicks with maturity *and* freshness.  It definitely had a bit of the High Fidelity feel, but was actually English this time.  Good job!

He had spent more than three hundred pounds on a jacket. And, to name just one more of Will's vainglorious achievements, He had spent more than twenty pounds on a haircut.In other words, Will Freeman is the kind of guy that most men aspire to be, and most women aspire to be with - whether either sex will admit it or not.After watching Chris and Paul Weitz's adaptation of About a Boy, I'm still not sure what surprised me more That Grant, who has made his career playing the lovable romantic bumbler (Notting Hill, Four Weddings and a Funeral), could be so perfect as the shallow cad described above. Or, that the Weitz brothers, who previously directed American Pie and the dreadful Chris Rock vehicle Down to Earth, were capable of making such a smart and often hilarious romantic comedy.Set in its original London (unlike the last Hornby adaptation, High Fidelity, which was transplanted to Chicago), About a Boy shows how Will's carefree life - comprised of countless hours playing pool, having his hair carefully disheveled at expensive salons, eating at posh restaurants, and having meaningless sex with as many women as possible - becomes complicated when he reluctantly befriends a troubled 12-year-old boy named Marcus (Nicholas Hoult).Is Will going to evolve? Is Marcus's friendship going to teach Will the valuable life lesson that, despite his claims to the contrary, no man is an island? You've probably seen enough movies to know the answers to these questions.But what makes About a Boy so refreshing is that the Weitz brothers, along with co-screenwriter Peter Hedges, effectively draw out the sentimental aspects of the story without overwhelming Hornby's acerbic brand of humor. (When Will goes to a meeting for single parents as a scam to pick-up grateful women, one woman boasts a T-shirt that says Lorena Bobbitt for Surgeon General.)Even Will's voice-over narration, a device commonly (mis)used by filmmakers to provide introspection, is mostly filled with sarcastic observations that consistently undermine whatever profound changes Will is experiencing.Grant does his part to shrink the sappiness by abandoning his trademark blinking and stuttering.  Rather than try to endear himself to everyone he meets, as typical in a romantic comedy, Grant seems to revel in Will's isolated, aloof existence. He gave a similar performance as the womanizing Daniel Cleaver in Bridget Jones's Diary, but with less charm and wit. Whereas Daniel was never trustworthy, Will parades his flaws so proudly that it's impossible not to cheer him on.The film also features strong performances by Hoult and Toni Collette as Marcus's depressed mom. Collette could be called the female Billy Bob Thornton thanks to her chameleon-like ability to portray totally disparate characters. In the recent drama Changing Lanes she was an attractive yuppie having an affair with the ethically-challenged Ben Affleck.  Here she convincingly plays a frumpy, eccentric single mom who is so depressed that she can't even make a bowl of cereal without crying.Of course, what most people who are reading this review probably want to know is if About a Boy is a better movie than High Fidelity. It isn't. But then, High Fidelity was a better book to begin with. Most Hornby fans I meet seem to agree.For those of you who may not already be Hornby fans, seeing About a Boy is an ideal place to start.

Hugh Grant did the same with `Notting Hill' back when `Episode 1' came out, quite successfully I might add, though I am sure the lack of Julia Roberts in this film may affect those box-office numbers a bit. All that useless info aside, I am happy to report that this film is a complete success! Mr. Grant is funny as ever playing yet another shade of shallow (Bridget Jones' Diary) until a young unpopular boy comes into his life to change all that. Believe me it's not as cheesy as it sounds, in fact aside from the necessary happy ending, it is anything but.	This film is based on Nick Hornby's (High Fidelity) novel of the same name, and though I've never read any of his books, I have seen and loved `High Fidelity' and can clearly see where all the original and funny dialogue comes from. Will (Grant) is depicted so well I mostly laughed out loud at just how low he went (pretending to have a child in order to get a date is a distant second to most of the other things he does here). You see the film offers narration from both Will and Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) `the boy', and is used mostly to contradict whatever impression it is they are giving to the people that surround them, the funniest scenes being near the beginning particularly during Will's dates. My quoting them here won't do justice, but surely you can imagine what the combination of Hugh Grant's character from `Bridget Jones' with dialogue and development by the guy that wrote `High Fidelity' would be like. Funny!	So, what is this film all about? Will, a man who hasn't worked a day in his life because he is still receiving `royalty fees' off his dad's Christmas Carol, and instead has spent his whole life trying to buy the perfect everything to replace human-comfort. His dates, mostly with single moms, go nowhere since he can't stand competing with their children, yet he is always right back wanting another of the same. Then we have a young boy named Marcus, highly unpopular in school, so much so that even the other unpopular kids don't want to hang with him. His mom (Collete) is suicidal but at heart loves her son it is herself she cannot live with. Will attends a single mother's support group as a desperate shot at scoring a date, he succeeds. On that date the woman announces that along with her child she will be bringing along her friends boy. And so it begins.	Will and Marcus play off each other well, Will not wanting to know anything about him and Marcus pushing to have him hang out with his mom, eventually succeeding, they become friends. It's usually at this point most films would take a predictable turn, surely a sign of relief that I could enjoy the rest of this movie when they didn't, by which I mean the boys mother and Will don't hook up. It's almost at all times a very fresh and entertaining film, casually dishing insight into the male psyche and hilariously depicting the birth of many uncommon relationships. Rachel Weisz (beauty from those `Mummy' movies) has a small but well cast role as the single mother that Will wants to hold onto.Behind the lens we have the directors (Chris and Paul Weitz) of `American Pie' and `Down to Earth', the latter being absolutely unwatchable, which manage to shed all signs of their past few flicks. I wonder how they managed to come to such a wonderful result and in fact how much input producer Robert De Niro (surprise) had. Cinematography and editing here blend well and comedic timing is at its best.	So their you have it, charming, unexpectedly funny and smart story, and nice acting the whole way through, what more can you ask for. Indeed it goes further than that but surely you can go see for yourself. I definitely feel as though Hugh has won me over once again. `Notting Hill' and `Bridget Jones' Diary' are 2 of my favorite movies (not all time, but I definitely love them), and `About a Boy' is now part of that list. He has personified another great character, yet one that is different enough to show his skill as an actor, deserving more attention then he gets. No more `Mickey Blue Eyes' please, this guy is `A' list material.

A book that has been part of your life for the best part of a week (or more) is reduced to one and a half hours of the main plotline. I had also misread the hype. The film is from the makers of Bridget Jones Diary; it is actually written and directed by two American guys, the Weitz Brothers. Their film credits include Antz (for which they wrote script) and America Pie. The plotline parallels the lives of two boys, thirty-five year old Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) and twelve year old Marcus (Nicholas Hoult). Will lives in a stylish apartment full of the latest technology and gadgets. His laidback lifestyle is funded by royalties from a novelty record his father wrote before he was born. He is happy drifting though life minimising his contact with others, except for the occasional sexual encounter. Marcus is not happy. He lives with his mother, a woman with strong beliefs who has been rendered emotional weak for reasons never fully explained. Eventually these two boys meet and a reluctant friendship develops.Hugh Grant's performance is his best to date. His delivery of the narration, in a dry, sardonic style, hints of the hidden depths that he assures his friends do not exist. The film is very much his. Toni Collette gives an excellent performance as the &#145;alternate' single mother who fails to appreciate her son's problems. And, despite my aversion, to child actors Nicholas Hoult delivered a very credible performance as the child who is struggling to cope in environments he can not control. The casting of child actors seem to have gradually improved as producers (*see below) have endeavoured to provide &#145;real' children and not &#145;cute' or &#145;precocious' child stars.The film has its weaknesses. The best lines have been lifted from Nick Hornby's book. Whilst its first three-quarters adhere to the book, it then diverts into a crisis incident before concluding with a scene that is again Hornby territory. Whilst there is nothing wrong with this construction it wasn't quite enough. The magic is also missing in its humour, that is not to say it is not funny, it is, although not as roaringly so as the hype would have you believe. Perhaps I went to this movie knowing too much and expected something extra to be delivered. I exited with a feeling it was enjoyable but &#133; Maybe Will's words express what I felt was missing, `Ah that's where you have me wrong. You've always thought I had hidden depths. But I really am this shallow.'27th April, 2002 Denise J Hale* I not 100% sure who is responsible for casting decisions, but as the producers are in charge of the money I decided the ultimate decision was probably theirs.

Take a shallow, and I mean SHALLOW guy, too much money and time on his hands and a fairly hedonist outlook on life. Oh, and he's as self-centred as a human being can get before declaring himself god. Then take a geeky boy with a terribly depressed mother, isolated and bullied because of his extreme geekiness. Make them the dual narrators of the movie, with their very different perspectives. Put the two in front of a TV set for a few consecutive afternoons. See how / whether they affect each other's thinking and actions, how they help each other become more acceptable human beings.This movie mixes laughs and humour with some well-drawn characters. But at some stage, their interactions become completely unbelievable. Especially the confrontations between the boy's mother and Hugh Grant's character in the restaurant (and later in the seemingly product-placed Audi) reek of unrealistic and poor writing. The writers succeeded in creating realistic and genuine characters. They failed at getting their interactions believable.On the humour side, yes, there were lots of opportunities to laugh. Although, most of the laughs weren't the merry, innocent and delighted sort you get from silly slapstick. The characters were too well-defined for that, so while it was funny, it was also slightly melancholic. Comparing this with Bridget Jone's diary, you'll get a very similar kind of humour and laughter and even narration. Oh, and identifying with the geeky boy more than just a little bit, half my laughs were through clenched teeth and a sour expression.

The ending was cliche but thats because it couldn't have ended any other way.  All in all good performances and well worth going to see.

Boy was I wrong! This is a movie for all the guys out there that wonder what life would be like to sit home all day and not worry about life. Okay, finally we are given the fact that its not all a bed of hot chilli flavoured noodles with a nice cold lager, but in all, every man at one point has wished for Will's way of life. Although after awhile you get the feeling that you may be watching a remake of the Micheal Caine film Alfie, the narration in the background, the feeling of uncaring views of women, and a change of life moment....Hugh's new hair gives him a better feel of the kind of guy you want to be and seems to have kicked into the feel good factor of his position. With a kitchen full of appliances that, more than likely, he has no idea of how to use, wide screen TV and the lasting complaint that he loves his DVD's and IMAX, he gives the impression that in the wrong environment, a man will never grow up. All that seemed to be missing was a Playstation 2 or XBox!The movie travels along at a fair pace and gives you the laughs in the right places and allows the guys being dragged out to what they might think is the Chick Flick of the week,  to enjoy the film without thinking that they are being shown the way they should be (as any man who's date swooned at Mr Darcy in Bridget Jones will attest to!).My only complaint is that with the soundtrack being done by Badly Drawn Boy, it achieves a samey character all the way through and doesn't quite help, not something to rush out and buy because it reminds you of a scene.Recommendations for the DVD from heaven... Will's guide to dating, alternative soundtrack, outtakes of the school hall scene, more Rachel!

Try as they might, the films directors could draw no more than the usual linear performance out of Sunset Boulevards favourite Englishman. And why should they even try? About a Boy will undoubtedly be a success. This is not a film that asks you any questions, nor is it a film that will move you. It's just a cheery, seamless extension of Notting Hill and Bridget Jones Diaries. If you like that sort of movie, then you'll love About a Boy. The script is just about witty and clever enough to suggest that Nick Hornby's book, on which the film is based, is worth reading, and there are one or two laughs along the way. Hornby must feel sold short, though, by the particularly low quality acting of Grant, Nicholas Hoult, (who plays the boy) and the rest of the cast. High Fidelity and Fever Pitch are far better adaptations of Hornby's work. Grant is the least well-placed actor to complain about being typecast (with the possible exception of Vinnie Jones) when he delivers the same persona in every film, regardless of his role or the plot.

Rachel Weisz is also very good, but her role in this movie was relatively small, and her character is unremarkable (slightly unlikeable, actually).The actress, who plays the boy's Mother, was very good at portraying a suicidal hippie -- she looked the part.

I know how it is to be approaching the 30's, without a real girlfriend with no definite plans of marrying anyone, and not be established in any way as a person with something going to really talk about.Personally, I'm not ready for any real relatoinship, but when everyone else around you has either married someone, or has a girlfriend then you feel weird. I imagine being 38 would be allot worst - unemployed and no girlfriend or family. Immediately, when I saw that intro-picture, I knew this movie was meant for me and felt involved with the characters.It had elements of trying to succeed with women, similar in themes to Hitch, where a prop of being a single dad is used to score on would be single mom's. It appears that creating a fictitious child could score well on hitting on a single mom to shag her - if you could keep the story together. I thought the whole skit was bold and very convincing.

Needless to say I was disappointed.I think where this movie started failing for me, for it does start off very well, is in the uniqueness of the boy and his mother. The two characters are presented as far out from an identifiable character as possible that they can't be reached by the audience. Sure, you can identify with a few aspects of their character, but they definitely stop being real.The character of Will is very close to being identifiable with, and so the audience can believe in him and feel emotion for him at the right times. Yet not for the boy or the mother, I mean when the boy declares to Will how recent events have upset him and really affected him, I felt sad and some empathy, but connection with my past or the character just didn't come. If only they'd injected a small part of reality into them then it would have.There's also a slight trouble with the clunkiness of some of the dialogue and choices that Will makes. His character is one that believes that a man can be an island...I'm bloody Ibiza!, yet he makes some absurd against character choices and statements. For example when he says he really enjoys Christmas with the most bizarre bunch of people, yet he's clearly not. His character could have come to the same conclusions and the story taken the same journey, just with a bit more of a real view.Still, there are some excellent moments, the argument in the bar over Marcus coming to his house when his mother suggests he's been interfering with him is both awkward and funny, an excellently built scene.One good thing for Grant out of all this is that the movie does a good job of dispelling his previous movie parts, and he really does do a good job of what he's given.However, the poor moments did make me roll my eyes and took me straight out of the movie. Light entertainment, and not much more.

When I finally got around to it, I was hooked, laughing aloud at numerous points, but was ultimately disappointed. By moving the story to the present day, from the book's 1994, a crucial plot point involving Kurt Cobain had to be discarded, and what ended up being the last ten minutes of the film had to be created from scratch. While my father felt the reworked conclusion was in the spirit of the movie, I thought it was wholly unbelievable and didn't actually accomplish the goal the rest of the picture had so wonderfully worked to set up. Additionally, reworking the ending in such a way should have had the ripple effect of reworking other scenes so that fewer characters would be introduced, but they weren't. Thus, several characters were brought into the story, plot lines involving them were touched on, and they were never paid off, which hurts the film even if the viewer hasn't read the novel.

But is in for a ride when he meets Marcus, a boy in need for a male role model and a third family member, since his mother is mentally unstable and Marcus figures, she needs a man in her life.The actors i feel worth mentioning, who made their performance believable and shook life in their characters were Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) and Fiona Brewer (Toni Colette). Nicholas doesn't get by on cute looks, like far too many kid actors, because he can actually act and shows that child actors are just as, if not more so, capable as their elders. Toni Colette, convincing as a mentally unstable single mother, you can nothing but feel empathy for her characters mental situation, it has come to a point in her life were nothing could make her happy. She was nothing more than adaptable to her characters life crisis.About the message of this movie, it's always hard to tell exactly since i don't think its ever written in stone, there are many views on just that subject. My view is, children of divorced parents, and how this is hard on both the child and the parent. It could also be about the difficulties of growing up in a society where it's hard to find who you really are, without following the crowd, you might get beaten, or bullied, but at least you're creating your own path.

I believe he is one of the most underrated actors of his own times. Barring a very few of his movies &#x96; I have almost seen all more then once. This was one of those exceptionally brilliant feel good movies. In this movie, Hugh Grant is a well off guy surviving on his dad's royalties, having a good time doing nothing but watching TV. He dates a single mother but unfortunately their relationship ends amicably, soon comes up with an idea to date single mothers only by joining a group called SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together). What life throws on him is a hilarious ride and how it all ends is simply superb, it actually made me laugh out loud like crazy, totally loved his straight face comedy. The guy even when in so much trouble makes a damn good face and tries to walk out of trouble in his own ways. Watch out for the last scene and his performance on stage &#x96; you will be in splits for sure. It's a damn good one time watch especially for those who love clean comedies. Not to be missed.The Movie As I mentioned earlier, Hugh is such a nice guy even in this movie that all his antics sound and look so genuine. His frustrations, confusions, reactions, even when he blurts out something in anger, it makes me laugh big time. Like it happens in this movie couple of times. The story is very simple and straight forward of a guy Will (Hugh Grant), who practically does nothing for a living as his dad composed some Christmas songs and the royalty coming from the same is more than enough for him to live a comfortable life. One fine day he meets a single mother but just in a couple of days he realizes they aren't meant to be together but since he is a nice guy and cares for her feelings &#x96; it's very hard for him to break off with her. To his shock, even she had the same feeling and they call it off amicably. But with this relationship he realizes one thing that its easy to be in a relationship with a single mother, have a good time and move on to the next, without any commitment or responsibility. During one of his grocery shopping trips he comes across an ad talking about a group called SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together), he joins them and claims that he has a two year old son whose currently gone with his separated wife. There he meets another parent and goes around with her. During one of their picnic trips, he meets her friend's 12 year old son Marcus (Nicholas Hoult). What happens in the picnic is hilarious stuff as Marcus kills a duck with a loaf of bread but Will saves him by creating a story, with which Marcus gets pretty impressed and develops a bond with him gradually.Marcus's mother too is a single parent and she tries committing suicide but somehow she is saved by Will and her neighboring friend who Will was dating previously. Marcus tries Will to date his mom to save her from loneliness but after their first date he follows Will and realizes that he neither has a kid nor is a divorcée. Marcus being a smart kid blackmails his way to his home and gets an access to Will's house as and when he wishes. They develop quite a good bond as they go out together and Will does helps him on couple of things, they do spend some good time together at Will's house. It was damn good to see Marcus's popularity starts growing in his school and he too ends up going around with a hot tom boyish girl Ellie (Natalia Tena), in the meantime Will too comes across Rachel (Rachel Weisz) and he uses Marcus as his own son to appear interesting to her. How they all meet and what goes around with Rachel's son and Marcus is hilarious, finally they end up breaking off as well and finally Will and Marcus too fight it off between themselves. What happens next and how it falls all over in right place is a classic ending. The last half an hour off the movie is too good with thinks going out of hands but again falling in right places. Marcus's social suicide even after his girl friends warning is too good and how Will saves him on stage is one hell of a scene. The way they have used one of my favorite songs Killing me softly here &#x96; it had me in splits. I am sure comedy lovers will enjoy this one big time.

One of his big interests is woman and discovers the untapped market of single mothers. This is how he meets Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), a 12-year-old boy with a depressed mother (Toni Collette) and is a social outcast. After Marcus' mother tries to kill herself Will and Marcus are forced into each other's lives and an unusual friendship starts to develop.The winning aspects of About a Boy is a witty script by the Weitz brothers and Peter Hedges and a great performance by Grant. Grant is great playing a selfish, self-centred man thinking only of himself who is forced to grow up and become responsible. Grant has great comic timing through and given good lines throughout. Some of the best moments is the use of narration and when it relations to the actual conversations on screen. There are natural relationships between the characters and the drama was well handled.The rest of the cast was also strong and the Weitz brothers certainly keep the film going at both a steady pace and make it visual. There is strong chemistry between everyone and the Weitz Brothers know where to find a good editor. They also know how to subtly move the camera and use trick to enhance the film and About a Boy is easily their best film.It is not a perfect film like the Rotten Tomatoes scores suggest and the 7.2 on IMDb is more fair. If you do not like drama-comedy About a Boy is not going to win you over and this film has more of a wit then outright laughs. Plus the third act felt very rushed as Will finds a love interest in the form of Rachel (Rachel Weisz, who was underused) and Marcus suddenly befriending an older girl, Ellie (Natalia Tena) when we should have seen more of her.

Why the heck Will doesn't date with Susie(the friend of Marcus's mum). Well I am sort of a viewer who questions the plot always and I these question just left there.Plus the story of a displaced kids should have been covered with a tag like the best comedy of the year This is supposed to be real life not just some comical crap! I would suggest you see Dear Frankie(a movie which is really under-rated-voted by around 3500 people only so far) then decide whether About A Boy is really good.

Nicholas Hault takes an uneasy role as the geeky kid who befriends him and a father-son relationship begins somehow. Oh, the kids mother (Toni Colette) is suicidal and a bit wacky which leads to a lot of embarrassment and unacceptance for Marcus (the kid) at school.There weren't many laugh out loud moments, and it didn't have the directness of next years love actually, but it was pretty heartfelt and realistic... No 4 gangster shootout at the end but this film didn't need it. Hault plays the kid who, there's one at every school, we all want to punch some sense into.

Basically, the story revolves around both rich Londoner Will Freeman (Golden Globe nominated Hugh Grant) and twelve year old Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), both with no real friends. When Will poses as a single father with a fictional son, to try and woo the attention of single mothers, who he finds very attractive, he manages to have some time with them, before letting them go not long later. As a result of one of his single mother relationships, he meets Marcus, who at first don't really see eye to eye, but after a few more encounters become good friends, teaching each other how to be cool, and growing up. Marcus's mother Fiona (BAFTA nominated Toni Collette) is a big problem in his life, being suicidal, and she does not pay enough attention to him as she could, but after Marcus, with some help from Will, go to the local school talent show, everything is settled and both the boys have each other and others for a happy ending. Also starring Rachel Weisz as Rachel, Isabel Brook as Angie, Sharon Small as Christine, Victoria Smurfit as Suzie and Nicholas Hutchison as John.

This movie is fresh and clean, and every scene feels air-conditioned. The script is excellent, every line fits well, and it's good to see that the one(s) behind it know how love begins, in contrary to the producers in Hollywood. The camera work is good. Some passages I have been looking for so much in other movies are being performed with ease here. The music fits very well. Rachel Weisz is acting good and well, unbelievable beautiful, one of the top five most beautiful women on screen ever if you ask me, without doubt.So, no let-downs at all? I think the film should have been better off being more emotional. When you leave the cinema you don't remember it that passionately, it's rather flat. I am not sure Hugh Grant is that good at being emotional. And a few longer still scenes would perhaps have given the film more depth.

This movie isn't (much of the time anyway) unpleasant; it's just not pleasant. I didn't for the most part find it enjoyable to watch. It has a few scenes in it which are somewhat humorous, but overall I found this a heavy kind of movie. Yes, it's hopeful - in a way. It brings lonely, sad and even depressed people together and lets them build a sort of family connection with one another so that by the end there's a sort of heartwarming scene of a very diverse and eclectic group of people gathering to celebrate Christmas with an extended-family feel, but that quasi-hopeful ending struck me as empty to be honest. There was no sense that any of this was going to last; no sense of permanence. These folks for this point in time were together. Yeah - there's something to be said for that, but for me at least it didn't overcome the overall sombre feel to this comedy.Hugh Grant has never really overwhelmed me. I've never quite understood the appeal he has for many people. His movies are usually pleasant in an understated, silly sort of way, and generally he plays variations on the same character - either the lost, lovelorn single guy or the guy who wants to avoid any serious commitments. He's the same here; although less likable than many of his characters lazy, shallow, manipulative. Here his character of Will latches on the the idea of pretending to be a single father so that he can meet single mothers. In the course of the deception, he connects with Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) - a sad, lonely, bullied 12 year old boy with a suicidal mother (Fiona, played by Toni Collette.) In fact, what really causes the bond in the relationship between Will and Marcus is when they discover Fiona after her suicide attempt. Marcus bonds afterward with the at first less than enthusiastic Will, and the two of them have to sort their way through life and their own relationship - all the while trying to build new relationships with those around them.I have to confess that this just didn't capture me. Yes, there were a few funny scenes, but I never really got the sense of what this was trying to accomplish, and after Fiona's suicide attempt I was puzzled. The single mother of a 12 year old boy attempts suicide, doesn't seem to be in the hospital for long, and then just goes home and takes up her role as a single mom again? In a way, that was really the vehicle for pushing this movie along, but it made no sense to me. There was also the problem that I didn't really like any of the characters - there was a shallowness and a phoniness to all of them. I could admire Marcus' devotion to helping his mom get better, I suppose, but beyond that none of them struck a chord with me. None of this really connected with me.

The Merchants of Disease no doubt are happy to reinforce in young minds that suave and cool guys (and gals too) smoke.  I was disgusted.*****Hugh Grant brings to About a Boy depth to his role as a man with neither an employment history nor a need for one thanks to an inheritance.  He proclaims with true insight that he is shallow and for much of the movie he demonstrates that quality.  His interests are totally hedonistic when they are not simply lazy.  Women are objectified for their sexual availability - he is amazed if they look for anything else in him.Of course that state of affairs can't continue and through a bed partner-hunting machination he becomes acquainted with Fiona (Toni Collett) and her very smart but out-of-the-loop with his peers kid, Marcus.  Credit is deserved for making Fiona, a single woman beyond the verge of a nervous breakdown, the unattractive and disturbed mess she is - there's no hint of glamour behind the neuroses, the usual cinematic depiction.  Toni Collett is believable, moving.No surprise that Will begins to discover, through Marcus, qualities he never thought he had in him.  Actually, he never did.  What is unfolded is the birth of a New Man.  What saves the story from being pedestrian is that Grant goes beyond his earlier patented portrayals of the vulnerable and confused male to engage in real and believable character development.  And his meeting Rachel (Rachel Weisz) has more reality to it than his earlier smooth but solely sex-directed hunting of beautiful women.Marcus is more than a catalyst for grownup transformation - he learns from Will without viewing him as an infallible role model (which he surely ain't).  Nicholas Hoult is wonderful in this role with shaded emotional nuances appropriate to both his unstable domestic life and the pressures any bright kid experiences at school when he's out of synch with the crowd.Two serious bothersome points.  The first is that this story perpetuates the all-too-frequent movie story line about kids who choose to or feel they must undertake the role of helping their parents and other adults deal with very serious problems that are, in reality, never rightfully a child's burden.  Marcus's maturity and commitment are admirable in the film but in reality a child in his situation probably wouldn't see a very happy resolution and might well feel responsibility for failing in his/her mission.  In movies, of course, the kid usually succeeds.  I can see kids from single parent homes watching this film and feeling either inspired to emulate Marcus or disturbed that they can't.Secondly but connectedly, About a Boy trivializes serious mental illness. It isn't done intentionally but if people could overcome their dangerously real depression through just meeting new people and enjoying good food, a lot of doctors and therapists could close their practices and go to law school.
