A film that redefines the art of movie-making and lives with the viewer long after he/she has experienced it. You may hear the critics mutter the words Star Wars, Citizen Kane or Gone With the Wind but, obviously, they don't know Ice, they don't know him at all.If ever there was a movie that proved the Oscars are a farce, it's Cool as Ice. It clearly got snubbed and I guess we'll never know why. The only reason I can fathom is the academy's fear of the Ice man's Day-glo clashing with the red carpet. Clearly the better solution would have been a Day-glo carpet.Maybe I'm a little biased because I see so much of myself in Ice's character and the personal journey he embarks on in the film. I, too, am a complex, misunderstood white male, searching for identity and a good lawn on which to do the running man. I also have a way with words and a way with the ladies and, gosh darn it, I just love to impress country folk with my fly threads and dope moves on the dance floor, yep yep.The script is a work of art and is destined to become a textbook example for its conflict, character development and subtext. I can't decide who the bigger genius is The writer or Vanilla Ice, himself, because let's face it it's not just the lines but the delivery of them. Lose the zero, get with the hero - pure gold.Do what ever it takes to see this film. Beg, borrow, steal or even buy it. For all those who still wear Day-glo clothing or caps with polished metal logos, who still shave lines into their eyebrows or just consider themselves romantics, Vanilla will reinforce what you already know You are Cool as Ice. It's also a hell of a lot better than watching Vanilla on Celebrity Boxing, no really it is.

But I believe it falls into a totally new genre of crappy cult classics. When watching a film like Cool as Ice, I find myself asking over and over again, Are they serious? Who wrote this film? When they were writing the screenplay were they thinking Yes, this is gold!Now though this film is horrible, I find it very quotable which I believe is a major factor in assessing the quality of a film. Lines like drop that zero and get with a hero are unforgettable and hilarious. This movie is actually better then 75% of the comedies that are released in the movies today which sometimes even do well in the box office. Such movies come stocked with cliché's and overused jokes and though may be good for a few cheap laughs, are hardly worth seeing. Cool as Ice however is humorous (though not on purpose) and I think can be appreciated by anyone who was growing up during the early 90's. It really sums up what early 1990's were all about. I admit that it may be a little embarrassing if someone were to stumble across this title in your movie collection but if you ever see this movie for sale at a yard sale, I would recommend buying it for the full 1.00 price tag. It is worth watching with friends for some good laughs. My friends and I always mention this movie when discussing movie trivia and pop culture of the last decade. It always makes us smile. And isn't that what you hope for in a good movie?

Cool As Ice is a cinematic tour de force, and it resonates with unique passion and joie de vivre.  Every character is brimming with both gritty realism and inspired originality, while the script is simply the best to be penned since Chinatown. Expertly crafted with stunning visuals and sparse narrative, the film presents a fascinating interpretation, through the use of archetypal characters, of the age-old story of the uptown girl and the downtown man. The cinematography is refreshingly restrained, with the intriguing exception of the use of Vanilla Ice's leather jacket as a narrative device.  The fresh threads contain numerous words, ranging from Down by Law (the name of a punk band), to Yep (1/2 of Ice's catch phrase), to Sex me up.  At relevant moments, the camera will dwell upon a particular word or expression, enhancing the cinematic experience dramatically.  Although it is but one example of the film's innovative technique, this device is representative of the consistently inventive, moving and magnificent film.  Already a well-respected movie, Cool As Ice will inevitably enter the annals of truly great cinema after sufficient time has past to permit its canonization.

As a film it truly deserves to be rooted in the worst 100 list, terribly acting by the two *bad* cops, worse still by straight laced Michael Gross - and the less said about Vanilla's acting ability the better.Worse than the acting is the absolutely hilarious Cameo by Naomi Campbell in the opening credits, who screams her way through a really really hideous song whilst dancing badly and constantly trying to brush her hair away from her face.After this initial horrific all singing all dancing intro, some bint gives Vanilla her phone number just so that we're reminded how great Vanilla ice is, and then the film starts proper. At this point you're just recovering from the awfulness of the dark warehouse intro, and suddenly you're assaulted by the wildy vivid colours of... pretty much everything actually, it's a constant throughout the film that everything is just too vivid, its hard to explain, but once you've noticed it, its actually quite amusing.This is pretty much how the film goes, just as you think you've seen the most awful scene in cinematic history, along comes another, worse one that manages to make the last one look average. A great example of this is the way that in the first couple of minutes, Vanilla 'bunny hops' his 250kg GSXR-1100 over a 5 foot high fence. An absolute classic moment in cinema which stays with you... kind of like syphillis.But it's for all these reasons (and hundreds more) that you should watch this film. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. I've never really been an advocate of the 'so bad it's good' school of thought, but I'll make an exception for this film. Not only have I seen it many times, but I bought it new from Amazon a little while ago so I can say I have an original copy. In years to come it will be completely priceless, such is the cult following of this shocking celluloid mistake.I really would recommend that you see it, not because it's great, but just so you can appreciate how bad something can actually be, and how much of a complete freak of a movie this is. I've never witnessed a scene in a movie which can compete with the pure hilarity of Vanilla dancing on his own, like a tw@t, outside the old people's house in his dayglo pants wearing his stupid jacket. I challenge anyone not to laugh outloud during this, and many other classic moments.Deserves both 1 out of 10 as a film, and 10 out of 10 as a must see classic bomb.

Along with MC Hammer and Marky Mark he pilfered and diluted black music to make it commercially acceptable to middle-class white children. His flash-in-the-pan `attitude' eventually fizzled away - but not before becoming the blueprint for every idiot bad-boy pop star on top of the charts today.Cut to ten years later, and the threat of an Ice comeback is unlikely. It's the perfect time to watch COOL AS ICE. The film bombed on release, and signaled the end was nigh for Vanilla Ice. Watching it today, the star reduced to a relic of inane pop history, the film becomes a candidate for the best worst film of all time.Rebels and their motorcycles have a history on screen. They define the times. Marlon Brando was the quintessential bad boy when he rode into town as THE WILD ONE. Fast-forward fifteen years and history repeats Fonda and Hopper rewrite the Hollywood rulebook in EASY RIDER.In COOL AS ICE, the bad boy of rap rides into the suburbs with his all-black posse, ready to reap havoc on suburbia, right? Wrong. Ice's crew only reappear when director David Kellogg requires a cut-away shot. Even then, rather than scaring the local children, they're making peanut-butter sandwiches and watching TV. They sit around, waiting for Vanilla to get the girl.The romantic sub-plot is a peach. She's the highest achieving student in town, but will she risk her future for Vanilla Ice? He's a self-educated poet of the street, although his actual words of wisdom somehow escape me at the moment. The sub-sub plot involves her father, who we are led to believe was the most honest cop on a corrupt force. Despite seemingly being transplanted back into the same community, he doesn't mind going on television so the bad guys can find him.There's a few other sub-sub-sub plots of minimal concern, but no real story. It's a star vehicle resting on the shoulders of a ludicrously vain idiot. Fortunately, his fifteen minutes of fame and torture translates to a typically foolish ninety minutes. The most vain ego exercise in Hollywood history? Perhaps. All in vain? Definitely.

That's what the rap star wanna-be Vanilla Ice thinks when he starred in this movie cluttered with the piece of dog dung script from David Stenn. The movie showcases the atrocious acting by Vanilla Ice who bolsters his ego to triumph over evil and injustice, and gets to shag the girl of his dreams (perverted fantasies more like describes his intention of establishing a torrid love affair). It's so unbelievably bad you have to suspend the disbelief just to get the kick out of making fun of Vanilla Ice as he attempts to act like he's going to win an Oscar for Best Actor but ends up being an amateur, only riddled with the terrible one-liners and smirk expressions so annoying you want to punch him in his face. The plot is nondescript. It's too absurd and rather bizarre to summarize, so I won't bother. The star Vanilla Ice leading a bunch of poseurs to run the errand and falling madly in love with a pretty girl and conquering evil is the plot I can think of. I must make a note of complaint that Cool As Ice is grossly misrated PG because there's the gratuitous use of the word D***, some violence, the particularly scary sequence and excessive sensuality. There are the scenes that literally had me die laughing. So funny you'll ache your ribs and feel the pain as Vanilla Ice intends it to become embarrassingly painful when he saw the finished version for the first time and have hid in oblivion since. Some particularly funny scenes (some may be spoilers)After the opening MTV-style music sequence, it becomes obvious that Vanilla Ice could not act when a sexy girl comes on to himJumping over the fence with the motorcycle and inadvertently hurts the girlVanilla Ice stole the black book with the list of female friends and looks like a pimp when he boasts to his poseur friendsVanilla Ice walks around wearing an overinflated orange puff coat with the bare chest and funky pants, shouting Hey, yo! What's up? in a grating accent in the first half hour, made to look like the gangbanging pusherAs the girl is about to enter into her house, Vanilla Ice grabs her elbow and said All right. I get it. Check this through. If you need me, I'll be right over there in front of her dim-bulbed frat boyfriend.A poorly choreographed fight scene between Vanilla Ice and the bunch of jocks Vanilla Ice is a potential sociopathic rapist when he enters and lies on the bed besides the sleeping girl without her consent/knowledgeThe overindulgent erotic interaction scenes between Vanilla Ice and the girl, and that includes pseudo dry humping and groping.

Glitter comes to mind, as does Graffiti Bridge. Cool As Ice, though, effortlessly reaches a level of tastelessness and outrageous contempt for narrative that those other films never quite find. As it stands, there aren't many movies out there that go this far in their attempts to push a product, in this case Vanilla Ice. It is a feature-length commercial for its star, and that's literally all it is. While it's not the first movie like this, it is the weirdest example that I've ever seen. There are many reasons, but the biggest reason is that for a movie called Cool As Ice, the star is uncool--to the extreme.Vanilla Ice is such a caricature that even if he had the skill as an actor to connect with the audience, it would be impossible to do so. The scheme seems to be to make him as alien as possible so as to appear cool. It backfires. The character he plays seems to have no name (it's Johnny Van Owen, but you don't really pick up on it). He speaks in some kind of cryptic language that's probably best exemplified in a scene where he announces he's going across the street to schling a schlong. What could that possibly mean? On second thought, never mind.In bad moviedom, Cool As Ice doesn't approach the level of enjoyability that other so bad they're good movies have, but you might be surprised how watchable it really is. Much like the nature-defying bike jump that Ice makes in the opening scenes of the movie, Cool As Ice hurtles over each turn of its framework script without even touching the ground. The scant few dramatic scenes that it dares to attempt are linked together by montage pieces, the best of which is a love montage where Ice and his rich bitch girlfriend drive out into the middle of the desert and jump around the framework of an unfinished house. In slow motion.As far as Vanilla Ice's music, I don't really understand how he could have had the biggest-selling rap album of all time and then suddenly be considered a joke. It's interesting, because nobody will tell you they enjoy Vanilla Ice's music, and yet apparently millions of people bought the record. So the joke is on who? Certainly not Vanilla Ice.But say whatever you will about him, this movie is bizarre. It's got great cinematography, courtesy of Janusz Kaminski, who went on from these humble beginnings to win an Oscar for his work on Schindler's List, after which he worked with Spielberg on a number of his big-budget films.

Strutting away in his own personal style, Johnny (Vanilla Ice) makes his way into the life of a young suburban girl, Kathy (Kristin Minter). Aided by his no-nonsense posse straight from the ghetto, he slowly but surely wows his way into her heart, solving her parents' mafia troubles with a mere flick of the wrist. From the first time they meet right up to their first kiss, the romantic plot will grab hold of your heart and sweep you along with the smooth coolness that only Vanilla Ice can deliver. What a dreamboat. Plenty of laughs too, as Vanilla Ice uses his dry-witted sense of humor to outsmart everybody who stands in his way. But there's more. We've all had situations where people judge us according to our looks, where we're from, and who they think we are. Vanilla Ice teaches us not to judge, to look beyond the exterior and to the true hearts and motives of people. Like he himself so wisely says It ain't where you from, it where you at. Something we all should realize. This movie is a true masterpiece that will long live to reflect the acting and music of this legend.

But even with a mediocre performance on the part of the Iceman and poor screen writing, I still find this movie enjoyable. Why? I don't know. Perhaps because it brings back fond memories.

Vanilla Ice is probably the worst excuse for a rapper to begin with (I don't like rap, but can at least respect legitimate rap artists) what made them think that he could try to act? The plot, or lack there of, is a shameless attempt to make Vanilla Ice look like the bad boy with a heart of gold rather than the schmuck that he really is. I hope that Michael Gross was paid well for this piece of crap, lord knows that he probably needed more cash after Family Ties went off the air, but why the hell did you do this movie????

But now no one will use it anyway because it's a Vanilla Ice line.I don't even want to get into the lack of story. His gang was obviously assembled by some studio head because none of these people would be caught dead with Vanilla Ice. The grandma and grandpa mechanics tried too hard to be funny, but fell well short of the mark. The girl's boyfriend and his friends are your typical preppie types that are always included in these films continue to show the lack of originality.

That one scene alone made me want too shoot Vanilla Ice more than I had ever wanted to before. 4.) What's up with that fight scene at the end of the movie?

Odd, but most sane people would consider this stalking!!! This clearly puts the movie in the category of Don't Try This At Home Kids!.In addition to this dangerous message, the film is filled with tons of Mr. Ice's music--which sounds, oddly, like a combination of traditional Hip-hop and the music of the Manhattans. I thought it was bad, but considering my age (45) I am not the best judge--I'll leave it to the younger crowd to tells us just how crap-tastic his music actually is.The film is essentially a vanity project for a man who appears to be a talentless jerk. Now I am not saying that is true for Mr. Ice--but the film, because of its lousy writing, gives this impression. I am sure he's a nice person and is good to his mother, but how can a film be good if it has dialog like the following golden excerptGirl Where are you from? Mr. Ice Around. Girl Around? Mr. Ice Yep.Yep.A bit later Mr. Ice I ain't where you're FROM matters anyway. It's more important where you are NOW.

This movie had one thing (and only one thing) going for it -- it is the most hilarious, most badly written, and most poorly made movie in years. Most of the cast isn't bad -- actors that were obviously temporarily insane when they made the movie -- but Vanilla Ice is out of his overly-shaved mind. The clothes, the hair, the sunglasses, the how's the hoise accent...cheese beyond belief! Of course, it's true what they say -- you haven't lived until you've seen this movie, if for no other reason than that you will need something to compare other movies to. Well, 'Wayne's World II' wasn't great, but it was nowhere NEAR as bad as 'Cool as Ice'.Why were people in awe of this guy? I'm sorry, but Johnny Owen was a freak. If that guy showed up at my door, I wouldn't be amazed, or stand-offish. I wouldn't be able to talk, because I would be rolling on the floor in hysterics. It's bad enough the movie was a loss, but did they have to destroy every illusion I had about small town bands? The whole point of the movie seemed to be to bolster up Vanilla's dying career, and expose the world to phrases like schling a schlong. I can't spoil the plot for you because, basically, there was none. A lot of dancing...or at least, what they apparently thought was dancing...well, at least Kristin Minter and Deezer D. went on to ER together.All that aside, I have to admit, I watched this movie three times.

Ice's acting is more wooden than a forest, and the plot contains more holes than a room full of swiss cheese. The supporting cast are equally as pathetic. James Hackett (Michael Gross) seems to be rather insane, and Jazz (Deezer D) looks like he'd rather be back on the ER set. From the way he acts, it is obvious that Vanilla Ice believes that Cool As Ice is a piece of cinematic brilliance. At the beginning of the movie people in the street are shown to be in awe of Ice and his posse as they ride through the town, but what is most confusing is that noone seems to realise just how ridiculous Vanilla Ice looks.

Now rather than write a review about a 20 year old sh*t film masquerading as a vanity piece for the poster boy of the misguided fashion generation, I thought I'd have a running diary of the events on screen and my thoughts as they happen.Now you can suffer along with me.1st minute &#x96; Credits roll, the first 20 seconds of a shitty music video start with a C & C Music Factory rip off track playing&#x85; I am sad.I look left and my wife is beaming.I am even sadder.2nd minute &#x96; Vanilla is lettin' it rip.

Every moment of every scene is filled with dialog or action too ridiculous to happen in real life, but somehow makes sense in a world where Vanilla Ice is the most awesome man alive. I think the only reason this doesn't get mentioned as one of the best bad movies is because it has been largely forgotten. If Cool As Ice played on cable as often as Road House, I can imagine it would have a massive cult following. But don't take my word for it.

The first time I saw it, it was completely over my head, but as with many films, time has shown me things I could have never understood at such a young age. Let me just say this movie is good. That's right, I know it has received a lot of negative feedback and sarcasm, but it is a good movie. I do agree there is a few minor plot holes and some of the acting needed work, but overall it was most enjoyable. I wouldn't rate it as Oscar-worthy because it is apparent that the talented cast and crew were only just beginning to harness their craft. After all, would you hold it against Picasso if his first painting was not a total masterpiece? Vanilla Ice, the self-proclaimed lyrical poet, was stunning as the lead-he has such magnetism for a lead role; if you can't see that then you don't know him, you don't know him at all! It seems as though Vanilla's keen business sense didn't do him justice with this movie, perhaps the timing just wasn't right for people to embrace a film so ahead of its time. On another note, His fame shows us the unfortunate part of living in a disposable society- as Ice proclaims in one of his songs- we have treated him like a dirty diaper-used him one time and then wiped him out. Sure everything was fine when people liked listening to dope raps about living life on the mean streets, wearing neon jackets and silk pants, shaving lightning bolts into our heads and putting globes on our lawns; but after that was old news we left Ice out to melt. What people seem to forget is there is a person under all that glamour-his name is Robert and he is a rap pioneer, a neon god-all the rappers today ain't got an ounce of mack on The Ice!I have heard some talk about a possible DVD release, I say forget that-this needs to be re-released in theaters. I think we are ready. The world has been through so much in the past couple years, and this film will remind us of what really matters- break dancing for your girl and crotch rockets. I also think that Ice needs to get back into acting, I know he is touring right now because he is coming to my city (he's doing small venues-trying to just keep it real-low-key and about the music) but hopefully he will get a chance to look at some scripts while he whisks around the states. I see him in something of a period piece-perhaps a civil war drama. He could shave yankee into his head and his unit could be the only rapping/break dancing unit on the battlefield. Maybe for something really avant garde they could wear fly hip hop uniforms- just a thought.Yep yep I can't rate this movie in stars-but i will give it 5 out of 4 word to your mothersIf rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram- V.

The movie opens with a dance/music video (don't worry friends, if this is what you're after this movie contains a plethora of them).  Ice is a badass rapper/dancer (they should have just cast Vanilla Ice as himself, it would have made more sense) who take a trip to visit some relatives who live in the countryside (you later find out he's a Chemistry major at Harvard!) before going back to college.  Their relative's house is a strange one, writing all over the walls, doors that are lined up one right after the other, spinning globes on the front lawn...  The movie music (i.e. none of the 90s pop hits or ice's own raps) is also badly placed.  Moments of tenseness are filled with a goofy kind of circus music.  I actually had to fast forward one part of the movie involving a date that ended up at a construction site.  The way Ice and the female lead character fall in love is just ridiculous.  The best part is when they're hanging out at the girl's house, try to figure out how Ice got there in the first place!  This movie's redeeming qualities come from the unintentional laughter you get from the music, the lack of actor quality (listen to how well some of the lines are read by some of the smaller roles), and cheesy love/action scenes that come one right after the other.

Pretty convenient, actually. Mr Ice, aka Mr. Van Winkle, had just exploded with his ripped-off Under Pressure sampled tune Ice-Ice Baby and was hot ironically enough, and was so big in the pop world that he got his own movie vehicle. As was to later befall the Spice Girls, Vanilla Ice chomped at the bit and acted as the new James Dean, a rebel without a cause but with plenty of banging' pants designed by color-blind dwarfs and a leather jacket with more random messages and symbols then a dozen grad students writing a dissertation could decipher. This filmic ode to rebellion and getting the girl (or not of course) and, um, girl's fathers who are in witness protection for ratting on fellow internal affairs cops who come back to extort money, is so joyously crappy that it may live on in infamy in some circles, the campy dark-side to everything Eminem represented.Why bother comment on plot? There isn't any. It's just a series of montages inter-cut with Vanilla Ice, with his partially shaved eyebrow and a look that is about as goofy as it is deadpan and serious and whatever-his-method-cowlick-head could think of, and the girl played by the hapless Kristin Minter in tow having some rebellious fun despite her father and family's protests. Why is this young man with his flashy bike and, um, possee of folk who spend there time waiting to repair bikes by Cheswick from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest in a house made out of maps and globes and giant salt and pepper shakers doing in this small super-times-3 *white* town? Who cares? It's all an excuse to just laugh one's head off at what is a mix of total ineptitude of direction and performance (the former provided by Mr. David Kellog who with one other exception has had his career taken up by helming straight-to-video Playboy Playmate bios), with dialog so classically bad that you'll repeat it for years (Lose the zero and get with the hero!), and oddly enough featuring some pretty interesting cinematography from Janusz (Shindler's List, Spielberg films since 1993) Kaminski who performs so high a standard of work here that it almost goes to further mock the reckless trash on screen. It's a sight to behold, really, for anyone who happened to live through that surreal period where rap was dominated either by fellows in absurdly baggy pants (MC Hammer) or had hair that scared old women and small children (Vanilla Ice), or for those wanting to see a time capsule of what-the-f*** rap songs punctuating plot twists that include the possible worst reading of a kidnapped kid's plea for help on an audio tape.ICE ICE CINEMA!

He's not as tough as he makes out, and it's obvious in this film. He says a lot of things in this film that does not match his face. Occasionally, when he's talking to little kids or out of character, his face lights up, his smile is genuine, and you see the person Mr Ice is comfortable with being Himself. A nice guy. To add to this his gang (the VIP?) look awkward too, being anything other than nice decent people. Is all the casting a little misaligned? No, not really. Michael Gross, of tremors fame, Naomi Campbell turns up at the start and end, Jack McGee and Sydney Lassick -- they all work fine. Even the little kid, is actually very good.What about the love interest, Kristin Minter? Is she mismatched with the hero Vanilla Ice? No. Is the bad guy, John Newton, unlikable? Yes.

Very 1980s, all movies had them in the 80s, these are shoe-horned in and themed like a bad 1990s music video.It's an above-age made for TV movies. No more, no less. I enjoyed it, for what it was.

"},{"Title":"Still fresh and slammin' even after 25 years","Date":"1 January 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Music, Romance","Review":" I just saw this movie again today. The first time was last night hahah. I can't get enough of it. I find that the more I view it, the better it becomes. I don't see it as ridiculous at all. Except maybe for the elderly couple mechanic, especially when they started break dancing! I think the movie is utterly sincere and very heartfelt. Though I didn't see this movie when it came out for various insignificant reasons (I was in the Phils and not sure if it was shown there. If it was, I wouldn't be in a habit of going to the theaters as a college student. I could only afford one movie at the time and I chose to see Jurassic park then. OK, yeah you're not interested in my teen life). I'm not exactly a fan but heck we had a legit intramural cheer song number to the tune of Ice, Ice Baby. And the rave reviews didn't deter me from choosing to view this on Hoopla. I wasn't expecting much. I was looking for something light and moderately entertaining. What I found is an earnest appreciation for it. The opening scene sets the tone for the movie. Dark room but not moody, some strobe lights, but it's not the disco. Dudes and dudettes (terms inappropriate for this genre) were on the dance floor. The energy is apparent. The steady almost graceful kind of motions that won't be mistaken for the hyperactive seizure dance of today, if that may be called as such. I reflected slowly and surely that Robert Matthew Van Winkle captivated my heart. First he can act. He's not awkward on camera. He exudes a kind of steelness quality only someone dubbed as him could warrant. He can dance and not completely unpleasing to the eyes either. Tall, blond and with striking good looks, who wouldn't be enthralled. Not just that, check out the wardrobe and the hairstyle! That haircut alone deserves a separate commentary. Lines shaved with asymmetrical geometric patterns and lightning bolts that extend to the eyebrows! His style is truly like a chemical spill, in Chernobyl!This movie was made 25 years ago and so much in our society have changed since. And people who questioned those scenes have got to understand that it was nonetheless still a different culture back then. Ghettos on motorbikes weren't so scary and suspicious. In this movie, they're simply a band of artist. A rapper and his break-dancing home-boys and well one home-girl. The representative kid in this movie, a 10-yr old boy, is aware of sex nut not obsessed about it even when he often chides his sister about i). The word sex is spoken but not done, even off camera. The romantic montage, which could very easily be littered with soft porn slow motion takes and salacious poses, was kept clean. (Considering the director's previous playboy flicks). There was not even tongue! It was GP. The movie simply isn't interested in sex. Come to think of it, I don't believe there were any curse words either. I don't recall hearing the 4-letter F word. The editing was smart using ingenious camera angles combined with tongue-in-cheek props (green eggs, Quotes on wallpaper, crazy fun-house cum garage). Cinematography is on par, nothing less to be expected from a future academy holder. And the writing? Words of wisdom such as ... If you ain't true to yourself then you ain't true to nobody Live your life for someone else, you ain't livin' It's not where you're from, it's where you're at Can you put it back together with quickness?... it's like Shakespeare! Of the 20th century. I don't care what any body else thinks, I love this movie.

Being nice, I will say it's not even in my bottom 50 of all time, but it's begging to be in the dishonorable mentions. It featured horrible clothing, an uncharismatic protagonist, terrible dialogue and a creepy older guy/young teen girl relationship &#x96; at one point, he shows up in the teen's bed feeding her ice when she awakes. Today, this innocent scene would ruin the movie as it's nothing shy of pedophilia. But, oh, well, Ice Ice Baby was a hit back then.After a horribly shot and all-but endless music video finishes the opening credits, our gang rides into a small town and mysteriously ends up at Pee Wee's playhouse and the leader, Vanilla Ice's Johnny woos a teen girl who's already taken and her father's in trouble with his past in some failed and cartoonish subplot. Will Johnny take Baby out of the corner and rap her heart away? Duh, but it will cliché your heart until you will never want a taste of Vanilla again.* * *Final thoughts Sure, I've heard of this, ever since it premiered, but never did I think I would ever see it. If not for the fantastic podcast, How Did This Get Made?, I would've always eluded it. Unfortunately, while I love those guys' take on bad movies, this one wasn't the best as the guest starred Vanilla Ice, so they &#x96; ah-hem &#x96; sugar coated their thoughts on this movie and made it out as a cult classic. Don't respect that one bit, nor did I think this movie was any bit a classic. It's not even so-bad, it's good. It just stinks&#x85;yo! "},{"Title":"Never has one man been so in love with the same man.","Date":"20 May 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Music, Romance","Review":" Watching the rise and fall of a flash-in-the-pan celebrity is always a little painful. That is especially true in the case of Vanilla Ice, a man whose lack of discernible talent, coupled with his persistence on building a cottage industry upon one silly rap song, brought about the demise of his career in the early 90s almost before it got started.Never has one man done so much with so little. Vanilla Ice - whose assumed stage name was apparently an improvement over Robbie Van Winkle - built his public persona on a square-jawed, white-as-an-eggshell rapper who could dance like Hammer and lay down some made rhymes, whatever that means. He was also persistently dedicated to forming his own language based on annoying, yet marketable, buzzwords Word to ya mutha and Vanilla Ice melts in ya mouth not in ya hand. Wordsworth, he ain't.Added to his lack of talent, Vanilla Ice became a brand name, culminating his strange association with the Ninja Turtles. Yet, even THAT wasn't the most ridiculous choice made about his career. The low-point was his desire &#x96; after proving every other lack of originality &#x96; to become a movie star.NOW there's a problem. Here he's entering the movie world, my world. Its one thing for this egotistical blowhard to take a wrecking ball to the world of rap music, but it's quite another for him to infiltrate the world of movies. Fortunately his singular effort was so horrifying that he never got a chance to follow it up.If I can find one thing about Cool As Ice to be impressed by, it may be that this eggshell talent managed to find a movie that is as flat, boring and generic as he is. I'm not sure what the plan was, but based on the narrative (believe it or not, it has one), the movie seems to be wedged somewhere between an Afterschool Special and one of those annoying cereal commercials with lots of neon colors and frantic motion. All that's missing a cartoon cat.It also might be mistaken for being a remake of the Brando classic The Wild One if I were convinced that Vanilla Ice or his crew had ever even heard of that movie. The movie is set in and around the luminousness that is Vanilla Ice. He plays Johnny Van Owen, a rapper who dresses in clothes that look patched together from bits of neon fabric. He travels around with his homies on motorcycles moving from gig to gig.The image of Johnny is something to behold. When he isn't dancing and rapping (which makes up the first seven minutes of the movie) he is generally seen bathed in a swath of white light as if sent from Heaven on the back of a stupid looking yellow motorcycle. His adventure begins when he comes across Kathy (Kristen Minter), a raven-haired beauty of the 2400 SAT set (believe it or not, Minter has the role originally offered to Gwyneth Paltrow).It isn't enough for she and Johnny to simply have a relationship, but the movie gives her a jerko boyfriend (Victor DiMattia) and a father (played Family Ties star Michael Gross) who is in the Witness Protection Program. Oh, and there's a little brother who thinks Johnny is the second coming.I must stop here and talk about an issue that can no longer go ignored. The issue being Janusz Kaminski, the great Polish cinematographer whose career was capped by an Oscar win for Schindler's List and then such distinguished credits as Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can, Jerry Maquire, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly and Lincoln. YET, his career began with the Vanilla Ice vehicle Cool As Ice. You have to wonder if he leaves it off his resume.In doing some digging, I find a quote from the great D.P. and I uncovered this one Truly, when you look at a horse, there are no emotions in its eyes. They don't blink, they don't smile and they don't get sad. They just get tired. I have to wonder if he was thinking of Vanilla Ice when he said that.

Back then, if you didn't have some, you were lame.Sure, the dialogue is cheesy.  The plot is lame.  The love scene is totally ridiculous.  If some guy took me on a date to a filthy construction site, I would smack him with a crane.  This was another attempt to cash in on a flash in the pan money machine, a la From Justin to Kelly.Luckily, with time comes wisdom.  When I saw the ads and trailers for From Justin to Kelly, I was smart enough to run the other way. Vanilla Ice's oscar worthy performance in Cool as Ice made me wary of all pop stars who attempt to become respected thespians.  (Think about the movie Glitter.) Besides, when the best lounge singer you can get is Naomi Campbell, there is something wrong.  If they had dubbed her voice, I could have understood that she was there as strictly eye candy.  Since they didn't, I am thinking that Vanilla Ice just wanted to score her digits and this was his idea of the easiest way to do so.If you want to show the youth of today things they should never wear, say, or do, show them this movie.  Let the butchered haircuts, horrific dayglo clothing, and sorry attempts at being a thug scare them into being the boring yuppies all parents want their children to see.

In the hands of master director David Kellogg, Vanilla Ice (aka Robert van Winkle) play Jo(h)nny van Owen, a cooler/rapper version of a Clint Eastwoodesque drifter. However, instead of the guts and glory that Eastwood offers at his best, the Kellogg/Winkle team tip that on its head, and create a great comical vehicle. There are many memorable supporting characters, including the ambigiously gay duo of policemen, the wacky motorcycle repairmen, and Jazz. However, the real gem is Winkle himself, propelling what might otherwise perhaps be well trodden comical material into something truly unique. Bravo.

I hate movies like this. It's the reason that movies like Gigli (another atrocity) get made. Instead of building the actors around the movie, they build the movie around the actors. Be wary of any movie that's made specifically to cash in on any kind of craze. Like you need me to tell you that.What's the worst thing about this movie? It has GOT to be Vanilla Ice himself. His dialog, his acting. Just horrible. And my beef isn't so much with the man himself. Pop culture has torn him up enough as it is. I highly doubt that he had anything to do with the writing of this movie, which is the worst of all. Really though, listen to his dialog! I'm convinced that a rich kid from Beverly Hills could be more street than he attempts to be in this movie. It's so obviously forced and out of touch it isn't funny. In fact, I doubt Vanilla Ice himself was quite THAT bad at attempting to sound like a credible bad boy. I can't stress this enough. His attempts to sound like a bad ass are unspeakably bad and embarrassing. Even the biggest try-too-hards I've ever met haven't been that bad.Ice's lines and acting aside, it's not the only terrible thing about the movie. Another annoying thing about this film is that it doesn't really go anywhere until what seems like an hour in. The romantic angle dominates most of the movie, and it appears as if the bad guy/action angle was just thrown in at the last minute to avoid this being classified as a romantic drama. I just kept sitting there thinking isn't this an action movie as well? When you can't manage to blend all plot elements of a movie together to create a steady and interesting pacing, then your script is a failure. Sure, the bad guys are present earlier in the film, but it adds almost nothing to the film. It doesn't make you feel as if it's really building up to anything without already knowing that the movie contains it.The action scenes themselves just flatly suck. I felt like the bad guys were every bumbling idiot bad guy duo you've ever seen. Is this a Saved By the Bell episode, or a serious movie? I couldn't tell at one point. Give Zack Morris* a even more ridiculous haircut, even cheesier dialog, and you could've fooled me. That's how bad it was. The writing and characters were actually worse than the average episode of that show. This movie is just dreadfully boring. None of the elements are in any way entertaining.*On a funny side note, there was indeed an episode of Saved By the Bell where the entire gang (in a dream sequence) became a famous band. Zack eventually went solo, and his manager clearly dressed him up to resemble Vanilla Ice. The difference is, if you've ever seen SBTB, you'd know that it could never really be taken seriously. I don't think that's what the writer or director of this movie had in mind.Terrible acting, terrible writing, terrible plot, terrible music, terribly boring, terrible film. Arguable the worst movie I've ever seen. Though, my hatred for the absolute atrocity that was Freeway 2 prevents me from putting the undeniable label on it. Really though, this movie is just PAINFUL to watch. Vanilla Ice's dialog in and of itself make it feel that way. But the rest of the movie just adds to it. It's not even one of those movies that's so bad it's good. It's just bad. Very, very bad.

I usually try to judge a film based on what it is, a serious film is generally judged harder than a campy one. With Cool as Ice it is definitively hard to know what the film makers were aiming for. It could very well be a kids film considering all the bright colors and such but there is too little focus on the kids. It could also be a parody of a gangster movie but several elements don't fit in there either. Whatever it is I feel it's wrong to judge it as a serious film because honestly, I can't take the Vanilla man seriously.I guess if I judge it film wise, it is rather bland and forgettable, the story is pointless, the characters are of no interest and the acting is not bad enough to put me off. The only part that sticks out is Vanilla Ice himself. He tries so hard to come off as cool but ends up looking utterly ridiculous throughout the film, from the quirky clothes to the wacky dialog and manners. It's as if the film was made as a vessel to promote Vanilla Ice but failed in doing so. "},{"Title":"The Iceman Sucketh","Date":"10 May 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Music, Romance","Review":" Almost every couple of years some pop star seems to get bitten by the acting bug and the results are usually disastrous. Mariah Carey tried it, Britney tried it, Cristina tried it, and Madonna tried it... repeatedly.And thus brings us to this review. Cool As Ice was an acting vehicle for soon-to-be one hit wonder Vanilla Ice. For a year back in the early nineties, the world was his oyster. He had an inescapable chart-topping single and sold over ten million records. All in all, not bad for a guy that nobody will admit to liking nowadays. This movie was the apex of the zeitgeist surrounding him and pretty much encapsulates everything that people loved, and HATED, about Vanilla Ice.First of all, this movie is funnier than most comedies. It's hard to decide what I found funnier; the bad acting, the surreal montages, the silly dialogue, Naomi Campbell singing. Take your pick.Vanilla Ice plays Johnny Van Owen, not that it matters since he's playing himself. His performance is the stuff of legend. Every line of his is so poorly delivered, yet paradoxically given so much conviction that he's a fountain of memeworthy dialogue Drop that zero and git with the hero, I got to go schilng a schlong, lookie, lookie, lookie, I got Kat's black bookie. and his inadvertent catchphrase, Yup yup. I crack up just thinking about them.As if this wasn't enough, the film treats him as though he is this deep, misunderstood individual. We are treated to filler scenes of him riding his motorcycle through the desert and staring off pensively into the distance with added emphasis given to his loud leather jacket with random phrases like sex me up, and down by law, scribbled on it. Other pointless scenes are devoted to suburbanites gawking at him and spontaneously breaking into dance on people's lawns.The movie soon decides it needs something for him to actually do, so it gives him a cold, snooty, love interest, who he meets by running over her horse. She is understandably angry but all our reckless doofus can say is she likes me. As for the actress, she does an OK job, but her characterization is rather disturbing. Her preppy boyfriend manhandles her frequently, and Vanilla, the man she's meant to be with, runs her over, steals from her, and breaks into her house while she's asleep. Apparently, stalking and physical abuse are a turn-on for this girl.The other players in this celluloid tragedy range from bad to laughably bad. Michael Gross looks and sounds bored to death, the brother and the boyfriend's line deliveries are wooden. The extras must've been on loan from the set of Troll 2. Special mention goes to the mobsters (yes, Vanilla Ice fights mobsters in this movie) who make the Home Alone burglars look scary. Never have I laughed so hard at a kidnapping. Then there's the hilariously awful bar band that manages to make Vanilla Ice sound good. And finally we have the bizarre old couple with the even MORE bizarre house. They were so entertaining and morbidly fascinating that I honestly think they deserved a movie of their own.Fortunately you don't have to focus too much on the acting as the film is filled with numerous montages that are either hilarious, surreal, or both. In addition to Ice's introspection scenes, we have the Winslows' introduction scene which is played at chipmunk speed and might as well have been set to Yakety Sax. Then there's the scene where Ice and Kathy exchange a line of dialogue and then start hopping around an unfinished house only to exchange more empty banter before more jumping and lather, rinse, repeat.The plot treads no new ground here good girl falls for bad boy. However, it is the inclusion of mobsters that is truly inspired. And it's all because the father is an idiot. Despite being in hiding for 20 years, he appears on TV allowing the mobsters to find him. Then the mobsters attempt to abduct Kathy by trailing her three feet away in their car with the headlights on. The father assumes that Ice is in cahoots with the mobsters based on an earlier bar fight that he didn't even witness. Kathy instantly believes him and dumps Ice in the next scene. Later the annoying brother is kidnapped and the parents assume Ice is involved. Finally Ice saves the day by using his superhearing to determine that the boy is at the same construction site where he had his falling-in-love montage. You can't make this stuff up.There is one silver lining to this movie though in that it actually helped one person's career instead of destroying it. The cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, would go on to work with Steven Spielberg . He deserves it because even though many of the shots are silly, they do look great.I just wonder if Spielberg ever teases him about it.

You can almost call this movie an charm school for single guys who want to find their future wife (in all seriousness, I think he did actually marry his female co-star but divorced her later)) . Guys who want to become a real ladies man should take notes from Vanilla Ice in this movie. I learned that snooty teen girls find it attractive when you knock them off their horse or tell them to Drop that Zero and Get with the Hero in front of their current boyfriend in an attempt to win their heart. Vanilla's highly refined social skills really helps him win over his girlfriend's parents. The lessons one can take from this movie are timeless; teen boys will be still using Vanilla's smooth pick-up lines on attractive women 50 years from now. I highly recommend this movie if you're a B movie fan who enjoys watching clown rappers try to make it in Hollywood.

Keep in mind that I watch a lot of movies that are said to be bad because I like to MST3K them, but it was really hard for me to slog through this junk. The plot concerns itself with three alternate realities that have collided into eachother and formed, what I like to call, The Cool Reality. The first reality is Vanilla's world, where everyone speaks like wannabe thugs and wears blinding neon pants and jackets with billiard balls on them. The second reality is the insanely stuffy, almost Twlight Zone town where everyone hangs out at the Sugar Shack and listens to really bad kareoke. The third reality is comprised of Godfather mobsters who have been spliced with the two goons from Home Alone. I suppose you could count that freaky Alice in Wonderland house as another reality, since giant saltshakers, flower- sprouting televisions and giant world maps on the roof are not, in my opinion, seen on every street. Here are some other notes on this flick 1. Why does the dorky dad owe the two goons $500,000? Did they ever explain why he had to change his name? Why is this even in the movie?? 2. 90% of this movie is Vanilla driving people around on his mustard yellow bike. He drives his girlfriend around, the little kid around, and spends a lot of time just cruisin' by himself. But does he ever get gas? I guess in Vanilla's reality, you don't need no stinkin' gas. 3. The opening credits sequence is hilarious. I love how the words Music By are written under the actual name and are typed in this Arial font that is WAY too small when compared to the giant neon block font. 4. Is Vanilla Ice a singer in this movie? He's singing at some freaky night club during the opening credits, and again at the end of the movie. So why does he ride cross country to his gigs?? 5. This movie proves that singers should not star in movies. The only one I can name who is a talented actor and singer is Jennifer Lopez, but other than that there is no one in the pop world who can carry an entire film. On the Line? Crossroads? Glitter?

This is one of the most appauling films I've ever seen. In no way is Vanilla Ice even remotely cool. His acting is so bad even Mariah Carey could outact as him. This film is hilarious if you like watching terrible films, but it drew the line when mr Ice rolled up his sleeves to reveal a pathetic tattoo on his arm whilst on a date to impress the bird and that stupid leather jacket with dodgy sayings like 'sex me up' on it. If only theyd picked MC Hammer for this film.........

Vanilla Ice portrays Johnny, an idealistic graduate student who wanders into an unnamed suburban wasteland while trying to get directions to his youth fellowship meeting.   Then, like Alice, he is transported through the looking glass into a disturbing realm of white picket fences, yard sales, and candy colored motorcycles.   As he makes his way through this underworld of brutality, he befriends a jolly gang of motorcycle enthusiasts, and a highly educated but morally bankrupt devil-woman, whose romantic pursuit of Johnny constantly puts him in jeopardy with a gang of uncouth and misogyinistic WASP's.  This film is a unflinching look into the rudimentary instincts of survival inherent within us all, and draws justified comparisons with Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs.  The lush but gritty black and white cinematography conjures a pseudo-documentary feel to this film, and makes the hard lines on the faces of these doomed souls so jagged that one must be carefull not to cut one's self.  The film's message is a simple one, in this life, none of us escape unscathed.

The acting is first-rate, the production value is unmistakable, and the directing is truly a rare and stimulating visual experience. Many films of it's kind tend to be basic and lack aesthetic value, but Cool As Ice is an undeniable theatre experience. I highly recommend this intense one of a kind thriller. When I first saw this film in Yemen, I didn't think America could produce such amazing filmography and creativity. The locals may shoot me for it, but it is worth keeping this movie just so I can watch it again and again and again. My wife Yuhmuhuhh Amed and my son Hurima-Shamir-Mohhamed-Abdul-Rauf are also COOL AS ICE!!!

Cuz we're made of ice!!!","Date":"9 February 2011","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Music, Romance","Review":" Hmmm, how do I even start this review without laughing hysterically? Most music artists who are at the top of their game just love the money that's coming in, same with their agents, lawyers, family and groupies, so what better way to look like they're trying to be honest with a life story than release a silly movie? Prince, Britney Spears, Michael Jackson, Madonna, 50 Cent&#x85; they've all been apart of this trend plus more. To think at a time in the early 90's Vanilla Ice was huge with his hit single Ice Ice Baby and was pretty unstoppable for 15 minutes. But given credit due, it's a catchy tune and one of the most successful songs of all time, one of the best selling rap singles as well&#x85; word. So to capture in on his roller coaster of success he apparently made a movie about how he keeps it real with Cool as Ice. This is a personal love letter from him to himself, just how awesome he is and that everyone around him just judges his looks and they're all wrong, that he's a nice cool guy. The acting, the editing, the story and all around this was just a disaster waiting to happen.The leader of a motorcycle gang Johnny falls in love with a small-town girl Kathy. He is a rebel without a cause and no adult takes him seriously for some odd reason despite his appropriate wardrobe that includes a spatchula hat and hamburglar shorts. Kathy finds out that her family is involved in the Witness Protection Program, they are being pursued by corrupt cops. Her father thinks that Johnny is part of the corrupt cops and forbids Kathy from seeing him but her heart of stone will be melted with ice! Wait, how does that even make sense? Yeah, that's the plot.You know lately I've been on this trend of watching movies that are so bad they're good again, I think Cool as Ice while very stupid falls easily into this category. There are classic lines such as Drop dat zero and get with da hero! and I'll see you tomorrow&#x85; You're seeing me now. It's funny how the love story is so awkward, Vanilla Ice is virtually a stalker who won't leave this poor girl alone and yet somehow she goes from completely hating him to loving him and saying how the world judges him wrongly despite the fact that the way they met is by him nearly killing her(though by a stupid accident). The editing is just a joke and must have been a college project because it just can't seem to keep a common theme other than let's see some Calvin Klein poses by Vanilla Ice. There's this random scene where Johnny and Kathy are getting to know each other at the construction site and randomly they're slow motion chasing each other throughout the site and dance music is playing in the background back to them talking back to them chasing in slow mo back to them kissing back to&#x85; well you get the idea.The characters are bland and very cliché. I was expecting the adults to have some kind of a silly over the top British accent with a cup of tea as the motorcycle gang rolls into town and say my gosh! Who let those rascal hooligans in our neighborhood?. Like I said the acting is just horrible from pretty much the whole cast. The only reason this movie is enjoyable on any level is because I think at the time Vanilla Ice took this very seriously. This movie is beyond dated and silly and Vanilla Ice is as white as wonder bread with mayo being eaten by a republican.

He breaks down in a small town where the story pretty much begins. He meets a local 'good girl' Kathy and woos her, much to her parents disapproval.Combines excellent dance moves and trendy (for that era) clothes with a story that has a nice twist. Though the acting may not always be brilliant, and in fact occasionally cheesy, it has a great storyline, great soundtrack, and overall i loved this movie.A MUST for any Vanilla Ice fans "},{"Title":"90's","Date":"9 April 2009","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Music, Romance","Review":" I remember when i was in high school this girl i was dating used to always try and make me watch this movie when it would come on vh1.

The over the top bravado and flash that Vanilla Ice displays as the hero of the film is hard to stomach. At first glance the movie has the depth of affect similar to a C+C Music Factory video. Loud clothes, flash in the pan catch phrases, ridiculous posturing and cooler-than-cool machismo prevail.But this should be understood within its context. It was the height of Vanilla Ice's career. Sanitized popular hip-hop music was taking America by storm and white kids across the country were drunk with the promise of liberation clothed in 8-ball jackets and words that could be shaved in one's head. What I'm trying to say simply is Cool as Ice isn't a whole lot different from 8 Mile, just the degree to which we can see the construction of its artifice.Moreover, as a film it's actually not that bad. Heavily formulaic, clumsy plot structure aside the film isn't straight mass-market garbage. The direction of photography is actually quite good, or at the very least its apparent that a lot of effort was put into making the right look for the film. The direction is also interesting at times and quite experimental for a mainstream movie such as when the Winslow family is introduced (a funky sped up montage with syncopated everyday domestic actions). The acting is also not terrible outside of Ice and his Posse. The Winslows are a decent assemblage of talent, especially Mr. Winslow and the kid is even pretty good for a kid actor.In short, yes, it's a crap movie but only to the extent to which is demonstrates the hype and crap inherent in all movies which are produced to profit on the most fashionable cultural zeitgeist. It isn't hard to find well reviewed examples of this kind of movie today. Looking beyond the image and train-wreck that is Vanilla Ice, you'll find a decent movie which is of course also hilarious in its datedness.

I've seen worse films (take David Cronenberg's Crash as an example) and people still tries to find the hidden mysterious beauty. C'mon David Cronenberg or not David Cronenberg Crash is bad.The same happens with Cool As Ice. Yes, I know it's not original, it's not new, and it doesn't has what Godfather has, but, nonetheless I guess it's a nice movie to watch those long Sundays when you are cozy in your bed without feeling like doing anything else...Well that's just my two cents on the matter (BTW, did I say that Vanilla Ice's acting is NOT THAT BAD)...
