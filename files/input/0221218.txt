However, when I came across it casually on HBO, I was immensely surprised and impressed!The story was gripping and I loved the character development - which is so rare in thrillers today. I thought the cast was brilliant, especially Diane Lane and Stellan Skarsgard. Stellan's character was completely chilling, and he played it so effectively. And Diane's character was also wonderfully displayed - despite her terrible actions at times, you can't help but empathize with her a bit, due to Diane's emotional investment in the role. And Trevor Morgan (who I also recently saw in A Rumor of Angels) is sure to do very well on the big screen for years to come... he's very good for such a young kid. And Leelee Sobieski... she was weak at times, but I felt that she was perfect for the part. She has kind of an authentic look to her and she was casted very well for the part. She had on-screen appeal without being too obnoxiously cutsie. She did a fair job, certainly enough to fulfil the director's vision of the movie - I'm sure of that.As far as the story goes, it's got everything you could want in a thriller. There were some holes, but some of my favorite movies of all-time have holes and I think it's really too much to ask for a perfect film. But it's downfall was that at times it was a bit predictable - but for me, that only enhanced the movie's suspense.I greatly enjoyed this movie and I think you will too. I'll agree with the critics that there are some technical flaws in some of the story's details - but over all, the story was very compelling and told VERY well, great development of it's characters and all the events were portrayed very believably, the director definitely kept the audience's trust and attention. So, I recommend it - despite the critic's bashing of the film. Personally, as a teenager, I thought the portrayal of LeeLee's high school was very realistic and so that definitely caught my attention in a good way. Little things like that, that are usually not apparent in most movies today, certainly made up for other little flaws. So, go catch it on HBO or rent it! It's good!

This is your eerie psychotic chase thriller similar to movies like 'Pacific Heights' and 'Unlawful Entry.' And, though it does play by the rules (unforutnately), there is something about it that makes it more entertaining than the recent dismal fare (not that Pacific Heights wasn't highly entertaining).Leelee Sobieski plays Ruby Baker, a kid going through the terrible teens. When she and her brother's parents die in a car accident, they move in with ultra-modern family friends, Terry and Erin Glass. You know right from the start that there is something dreadfully suspicious and exceedingly bizarre about the Glass couple, but you can never be too sure exactly what at first (that's the purpose of a thriller, to throw you a few hints and let your quick assumptions guide you into all the wrong paths so that you're--hopefully--pleasantly surprised when the real perpetrator and his motives are revealed). But, Ruby Baker is a smart kid who's ever-present skepticism about the intentions of her new surrogate parents, and starts trying to figure out what's wrong. Unfortunately, this movie does terribly follow the book when it comes to the main character being disbelieved by other well-meaning characters (social workers, lawyers, teachers, etc.) who consequently pay with their lives for their doubts and unwillingness to really investigate, and in turn, making things worse for poor Ruby. It also follows the book when it comes to the deranged finale and the he's-not-really dead ending.But, there is something that makes this better than most of its kind. On the one hand, you're never sure whether you can always trust Ruby because even she, too, arrogant most of the time, seems like trouble. It's hard to sympathize for a character like that at first. And, not only does Stellan Skarsgård make an appropriate villain as Terry Glass, his wife (played by Diane Lane) is not entirely an innocent creature herself as most women are often written to be in the role of the creep's wife/girlfriend/mother, etc. A good mix of characters and a creepy setting, combined with a decent finale, make it just the perfect mix of suspenseful elements. And one that I would recommend seeing.

The plot does, admittedly have some holes, but these newer thrillers are rarely(read never) perfect. All things considered, it wasn't a disappointment, as I didn't have that high expectations. The plot is OK, fairly see-through and obvious though, but it does have some twists that I(even though I may be alone on this) wasn't expecting. The acting isn't anything special, but at least Skarsgård and Sobieski both pull of decent performances. The characters are reasonably well-written, none of them come off as one-dimensional stereotypes, even though some of them, in all honesty, more or less are. The script is fairly well-written, though it does have its share of cliches, but most films do, anyway. All in all, a fair addition to the thriller genre, nothing that will stay in your mind for a long while after seeing it. It will, however, most likely keep your interest for the duration of the film, and keep you entertained, too. I recommend it to fans of thrillers, it would help to be a fan of at least one of the actors, and it doesn't hurt to have reasonably low standards or expectations. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Leelee Sobieski kicks some Glass","Date":"8 February 2008","Score":"11 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" I apologize for the pun, I could not resist myself. This film was recommended to me by a friend, and I had never heard of it, so I could not really say what I was expecting. What I received though was a smart, intense, fun, excellently executed thriller with wonderful performances that entertains from beginning to end.Leelee Sobieski brings to her character, Ruby Baker, depth and likablity without even having to apply much effort to it. Stellan Skarsgård and Diane Lane are great as the Terrence and Erin Glass, and even Trevor Morgan gives a nice performances as Ruby's younger brother, Rhett Baker. The performances are part of what is effective with this movie. Everyone delivered their lines and completed scenes with finesse, even if they weren't Oscar worthy presentations and they created the atmosphere that the director was trying to set perfectly.The film is not boring at all and it's not mediocre as a lot of reviews suggest. It has a nice, suspenseful build up and the material, while the gist is a bit overused, is fresh in it's own way. Who says an unoriginal plot has to bad? Is that a written rule? The plot is simply marvelous in this film, if you ask me. I enjoyed so much seeing how the twist in the film starts to slowly unravel piece by piece, because I liked the characters and was interested in the story from the get go. The movie almost trips on it's own feet a couple of times, but nothing seriously major that is worth noting keeps you from enjoying the fun and satisfaction the film brings. I even was extremely fond of the setting, and for those of you who say it's an overrated pun with the Glasses living in a house mostly made of glass, there are horror classics throughout history that work off puns much cornier, and The Glass House does it very well, stop complaining.In any matter, as I have said, The Glass House is non-stop fun and excitement from beginning to end with delightful and even memorable performances (i.e. Leelee Sobieski, who indeed gives the finest performance of all, and probably the finest of her career in general), an intense and realistic atmosphere, relentless build up and a twist that I honestly could not see coming. I loved it and had an amazing time watching it! It was a riveting, effective, astonishing accomplishment in my book.

The wealthy occupants, Terry and Erin Glass (Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane), become legal guardians of sixteen-year old Rudy (Leelee Sobieski) and eleven-year old Rhett (Trevor Morgan), when the kids' parents die in an automobile accident.	Terry and Erin were the best friends of the children's parents. They welcome their new guests into a world of wealth, glamour, and fun. Soon enough, however, Rudy notices strange quirks about these seemingly friendly folks. Is Terry secretly watching Rudy change her clothes? Is Erin addicted to prescription drugs, or is she a diabetic? Was her parents' death an accident, or a diabolical act of murder? Trust becomes as transparent as the glass surrounding this family. 	The Glass House opened to mostly negative reviews, and not without probable cause. The setup provides an intriguing, imaginative situation, but everything happens so quickly the film forgets character introduction. First time-feature director Daniel Sackheim helms a hole-laden script by Wesley Strick that creates more plot holes than Swiss cheese. The film derives into involving material, but lacks the focus to play out these plot points.	While Daniel Sackheim and Wesley Strick create a movie that lacks the timeliness and intelligence of a first-rate, edge-of-your-seat thrill ride, The Glass House does offer good suspense and a plot that reveals itself with tantalizing sinister hints and increasing tension. It keeps us guessing, even if this diabolical fairy tale is anything but surprising.	Leelee Sobieski has been in a lot of movies lately, and that's not a coincidence. She is a very talented actress, and she carries The Glass House through many plot miscalculations. Trevor Morgan, seen in Jurassic Park 3, adequately supports Sobieski's thorough, convincing performance. The very gifted Diane Lane and Stellan Skarsgard cover their sinister motives with pretentious personalities, but inject a mysterious, menacing undercurrent.	The Glass House also provides a fresh, unique outlook on villains. Instead of causing trouble, these characters get themselves into trouble, which eventually makes them dangerous. Innovative, original twists like these are what make this movie worth a look.  They say those who live in glass houses should not throw stones, but the villains in The Glass House do, and it's only a matter of time before everything shatters and breaks apart. It's quite involving watching these events come about, especially through a character driven story.

The movie introduces Ruby (Leelee Sobieski) as a bit of a troubled kid, whose troubles become much more complicated when her parents are killed in a car accident, and she and her brother are sent to live with the Glass family - friends of their parents (played by Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane.) And, yes, the Glasses live in a house that seems to have a lot of glass - too cute by a longshot.The suspense is around the Glasses. What are they up to? They haven't been especially close to Ruby's parents in recent years, and there's a certain creepiness to them (and especially to Skarsgard's Terry) right from the start. That builds to the point where the Glasses become downright dangerous to the kids. However, there really isn't much mystery about what the Glasses want. (It's revealed fairly quickly that the kids have a large trust fund and that Terry needs money to pay off a loanshark he's in trouble with.) So there's no real suspense around motive, and you pretty much know that although it's going to be a rough ride the kids are going to end up OK (because they always do in this kind of movie.) So the story isn't really that compelling. The performances (mostly from Sobieski, Skarsgard and Lane) are decent, but I didn't think anyone in the cast was truly outstanding.Two things worked really well in the movie. Director Daniel Sackheim did a good job of gradually turning the Glasses from just a creepy couple into a dangerous couple. (At first, Terry's interest in the 16 year old Ruby was truly creepy - it seemed physical more than financial, a suggestion that was let go of fairly quickly in favour of the financial motive.) The other thing that worked well was the setting in the house. Yes, the play on words was a bit too cute, but the big house with its somewhat confusing design and all sorts of windows both inside and outside so that the characters (and the viewer) could often catch a glimpse of what was going on was effective. But, still, a suspense/thriller that's almost entirely predictable and that therefore has no real edge of your seat moments can't be considered truly good.

The reason being that I'm not a great fan of &#145;startle-you-scenes' movies, where story line comes second to all possible means to startle the audience out of their shoes (which I believe is a the wrong way in creating good horror/thriller action movies).  The Glass House is however not one of these, and I suspect that is one of the reason some people have given it slack reviews.  Here they seem to keep to more realistic theme, with characters re-acting in intelligent manner, instead of some idiots you often see in horror/thriller films.  The interesting thing was that the girl in the movie suspected from the start that something was wrong, and tried to solve the situation.  The authorities became part of the picture from the start, instead of the usual stupidity that someone &#145;evil' resides in position of authority, denying the victim any help.  The Glass couple were a bit unusual, though not overdoing it, and we can follow how they slip into their own nightmarish madness.  Especially good was the scene were Mr. Glass is asking for a loan at a bank, displaying how, in fact, he was just a regular man.

The guardians owe an enormous amount of money to the mob and intend to cheat Sobieksi and her brother out of the four million bucks in the trust fund. They'll kill the kids if necessary. After all, it turns out, they engineered the parents' car so as to disable it, disposing of the parents and leaving the two kids as helpless orphans. Something like that.Leelee Sobieski, I kind of like. Her acting talents may be modest but at least they exist. And her features are memorable -- those plump cheeks, that tiny mouth whose upper lip is chevron shaped, and those startling blue Tartar eyes. She reminds me of Dee Dee Myers, the former adviser to President Clinton. Dee Dee, Leelee. Might they not be one and the same person? True, I am nervous. Very, very nervous, but why WILL you call me mad? Let me put it this way. Have you ever seen the two of them in the same room at the same time? I thought not. Stellan Skarsgard is always dependable, and sometimes more than that. The other performers fade into the woodwork.It's the plot that sinks this attempt at a chiller. There isn't a single instant that doesn't make a viewer feel that, somewhere, some time, he's seen this before. (And he has.) It incorporates every cliché in the formula.I'll give just one example. Skarsgard is making a private, incriminating phone call late at night in his Malibu mansion. Sobieski is downstairs in the kitchen. She picks up the second phone and pushes Listen. She accidentally makes a slight noise. Skarsgard hears it and begins to creep suspiciously toward the kitchen, but Sobieski doesn't know he's heard. Closer and closer. Cross-cutting between the scowling Skarsgard with the phone to his ear and the unsuspecting wide-eyed Sobieski behind the kitchen door. Skarsgard reaches the door. Sobieski yanks her head around. Skarsgard flings the door open. No Sobieski. She's darted away just in time.This sort of thing goes on and on. In the climactic auto chase, Skarsgard rams through a wall and his Jaguar rolls down a cliff and smashes to pieces.I glanced gratefully heavenward -- at least they'd managed to avoid the ritual of the corpse leaping back to life. But, no. While Sobieski and her brother sit alone in their silent car on the highway, the shockingly bloodied Skarsgard staggers through the hole in the wall with the intent of killing the two children. You know what I want to be when I grow up? One of the heavies in a horror movie. They never die. They take a beating but keep on ticking.If you've never seen a movie before -- if you've never HEARD of movies -- you'll probably find this one engaging.

The movies tries to play with you for the first 30 minutes or so, letting you think that maybe it's just a misunderstanding, but the movie's not really about are they or aren't they? it's clear that they are.We are meant to sympathize with young Ruby (Leelee Sobieski) because she is the underdog and no one believes her, even when we, the audience, know she is telling the truth.  The script seems rather sloppy.  There is an attempt at justifying Terry Glass's (Stellan Skarsgärd) evil by putting him in conflict with someone more evil than him.  All this serves to do is dilute the main conflict and at times make you almost sympathize with Terry.  I had to remind myself oh yeah, the guy committed murder.After being seen in the beginning, Ruby's friends have a single scene in the middle where they talk about having not heard from her but then are never heard from again.  Why?  Why was this scene here?  So we wouldn't wonder what happened to them?  Or to answer the question the screenwriter thought we might be asking why haven't they tried to get in touch with her and/or why hasn't Ruby confided in them?  either way, the scene only reminds of them when we hadn't been thinking of them and highlights their absence for the remainder of the film.The Glass House does have some suspenseful moments but taken as a whole, there are simply to many contrived moments and people doing stupid things because they have to to further the plot to make this a truly enjoyable or worthwhile thriller.

The fact it's taken me thirteen years to watch a movie staring my childhood crush Diane Lane, the always usually reliable Stellan Skarsgard and one of my favourite young actress's of the era Leelee Sobieski says how badly this movie did and was reviewed upon release. When Ruby (Sobieski) and Rhett Baker's parents are killed in a car accident, they must travel to Malibu, to live with Terrence and Erin Glass, their former neighbours. But they are not the friendly couple the claim to be. The movie is massively flawed in several areas, I have never seen Lane put in a performance this bad before, and likewise Skarsgard puts in a career low performance. Only Sobieski puts in a good performance, and she certainly fills out a bikini nicely. Both talented and attractive in equal measure, it's because of her the movie succeeds where it does. I'm amazed her career never hit higher heights. Bruce Dern pops up in a role as a lawyer and he is also OK. A lot of my problems with this movie are more to do with the script and it's direction.It is lazily shot with just the actors seemingly placed in front of the camera. As for the script it does not have a natural flow with lots of things going on all at once and lots of things unexplained as characters come and go.Outside of Sobieski, there is little to enjoy, but another asset to this movie is the score. It hits all the rights spots, at all the right times. Despite everything I think the premise of the movie is a good one, and with Sobieski at the lead it's more than watchable. I think released a month earlier, this would have done very differently. A 7/10 is a generous score, but since the movie was carried solely by Sobieski it's a worthy one.

The girl soon realises that something's seriously wrong in their new home, a sinister situation embodied by an overacting Stellan Skarsgard (a guy who seems to be typecast as the bad guy in Hollywood).That's a halfway decent premise, but THE GLASS HOUSE wastes its potential as it goes on, ending up mired in a muddled middle and uninspiring climax.

X-Files fans may recognise Daniel Sackheim's name- he directed a few episodes like 'The Host', 'S.R.819' and 'DeepThroat'. The movie started off nicely, but ultimately lost the plot and led to an unsatisfactory conclusion.The GOODThe spoof slasher movie the girls are watching at the beginning. It amused this slasher fan.Leelee Sobieski is very good. I enjoyed her performance in Roadkill/JoyRide, and she was great in this too.Terry Glass (Skaarsgard) is good up to a point (see The BAD). He's one creepy sonofabitch!The tie-in with Hamlet was effective.Some good suspense scenes, and interaction between Sobieski & Trevor Morgan. Morgan's 'Blair Witch' comment was amusing.Loads of familiar faces, particularly Carly Pope ('Sam' in Popular) and Michael Paul Chan ('Mr Lee' in Falling Down)The scenes with Sobieski and her parents' estate lawyer. (See The BAD also.)The BADThe loan sharks ruined the menace of Terry Glass and were, I think, an unnecessary addition to the plot. The only good thing about them is that the one in the red car in the chase at the end resembles my English teacher and (while I hold no ill will towards the man at all- he's actually a nice guy) it's really funny to see him obliterated!!Lack of decent screen time for Diane Lane & Trevor Morgan.The lawyer's 'turn' at the end- stupid.The climax. Ruby should have ran the b*****d over a few more times for good measure.This is what annoyed me the most Carly Pope and the rest of Sobieski's former cliq reappear later in the film wondering why they haven't heard from her. This leads us to believe they're gonna play an important part in the remainder of the movie- they don't appear again at all. Either lazy script writing or poor editing- Sobieski should have called them at the end or something. Instead these loose ends are left, annoyingly untied.

Well I was breathless alright, breathless laughing at the fact that this script was given approval to be put into production!Hollywood must have thousands of scripts floating around, many that are rejected. If the Glass House is an example of what is being created I would hate to see what is being rejected.The basic plot sumise is that a sixteen year old girl and her eleven year old brother are orphaned after their parents are killed in a car accident and they are left to live with the evil Glass Family, (hence the title Glass House).Why on earth did Ruby suspect that her new parents were evil? Was it before they made her eat Calamari.. or after they bought her and her brother a N64 and a playstation??? It seems that this little twit took a stab in the dark that her parents had an ulterior motive for taking the two in and it just happened to be right... pretty big hunch it seems to me....The script is corny. Ruby (the sixteen year old orphan)'s friends are as two dimensional as A4 paper, I mistook Mrs Glass for being the house keeper her role is so minor, and Mr Glass has an accent soo thick I had to use teltext to understand what he was saying. The only real credit to the film was the little brother who has a total of about eleven minutes screen time.Im glad i didnt waste thirteen dollars on it at the movies. I'm cheesed off that i wasted a Saturday night and six dollars on it on video. If you want to see a crappy B grade movie about evil home invaders, go spend a dollar getting Stepfather or The Hand that Rocked the Cradle on weekly hire.

It basically cliches off of every other suspense movie with this type of plot that has been made in the past ten years. Leelee Sobieski and Trevor Morgan play two young kids who are sent to live with family friends after the untimely demise of their parents. Stellan Skarsgard plays Terry Glass, a man who seems all too normal, but has something to hide. THE GLASS HOUSE steals so many things from so many movies, I couldn't possibly name them all. The end of the film doesn't even qualify as suspense. The thing that really lets you know what type of movie you are watching is the setting. If it is dark out, you know that you are watching either a horror movie or a thriller. But the climax of this film takes place in broad daylight. And, predictably (and also unbelievably) the bad guy comes back from some disaster that no one else could have survived. It isn't good the way he actually does die. No suspense! NONE! This film was an okay one, but not very original anywhere. Something that is kind of like this would be DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE. Little originality and not very much suspense. I give this flick 3/5.

In The Glass House, the characters pelt the audience's credibility with rocks.  The plot moves along, ticking off one necessary point after another until all the pieces are in place.  Yes, they all fit together, but it's like building those puzzles with the picture on the box you already know what you're going to get at the beginning.The movie stars Leelee Sobieski as Ruby, a sixteen-year old (a bit of a stretch considering she recently played a college student in Joy Ride) who is a typical rebellious teenager as the story opens.  She and her brother are orphaned when their parents are killed in a car accident.  Before they died, her parents arranged with their attorney to have their former neighbors, Erin and Terry Glass, to be their legal guardians should anything happen to them.  So the kids are taken to the Glass's house in Malibu, which is in fact (ho ho) a glass house.What follows is a series of scenes designed to demonstrate how the Glasses are not all they appear to be.  These involve sequences in which Ruby ends up again and again to be in just the right place to overhear crucial conversations on the phone, in other rooms, etc.  The script ensures that she always knows everything she needs to know so she can outwit the villains.  The entire deception, when revealed, seems needlessly complicated and depends heavily on outsiders lacking in perception to such a degree they won't notice obvious signs that something is wrong.I appreciated the movie's craftsmanship and it's performances, especially that of Sobieski and Stellan Skarsgard.  Bruce Dern also turns in a nice role as the attorney who may know more than he's letting on.  And I like the way Diane Lane suggests subtle motives for her character.  There were several clever moments late in the film when Ruby is able to think one step ahead of her antagonists, but that is only because she knows more than she should be able to know in reality.  The ending is the kind of Hollywood payoff that is all too familiar, and I think a more original one would have been easy to come up with.The movie has a lot of technical skill but I can't recommend it on that basis alone.

In the usual fashion, we are shown how good the bad people are, and how oblivious everyone is to that fact.  When Ruby figures it out, she can't make outsiders understand.  Mainly because those outsiders are insiders and made good friends with the bad people. Confusing? No, just boring, same-old same-old.As we move through the film it became obvious which side people were on, and what they were going to do with this two-sided knowledge.  You can see this when Ruby (Leelee Sobieski, in a talent-wasting role) talks to her trust lawyer, and the social worker.  You know early on what will happen to everyone, and really don't care after you figure it out.The film has a few moments where there could have been genuine suspense created, but we are quickly assured that this will not occur.

Apparently, though, Hollywood seems to have a fixation with perverts, so I have to keep writing about them. This week's waste of time is `The Glass House,' directed by Daniel Sackheim.  Leelee Sobieski is on board as Ruby Baker, a spoiled teenager from San Fernando Valley.  When she and her brother are orphaned, family friends Terry and Erin Glass (Stellan Skaarsgard and Diane Lane, respectively) take them in and promise them a life of luxury in their Malibu home.  When I say luxury, I mean attempted murder, drug abuse and sexual harassment. I had to laugh a little when I first visited the film's site on the Internet Movie Database (www.imdb.com).  The viewer comments section is headlined by the quote `Atmospheric and chilling.  A wonderful movie.'Atmospheric, yes.  Chilling?  Not so much.  Wonderful?  Maybe , if you compare it to `Bio-Dome.' `The Glas House' is Daniel Sackheim's first Hollywood attempt, though he's had plenty of experience in the world of television.  His previeous works have included `Judging Amy' as well as several TV movies, and it shows. Aside from the fact that the thing looks like it belongs on `Lifetime,' it's an unfortunate rip-off of such second-rate films as `The Hand the Rocks the Cradle' or `Fear.'  One one hand, there are some great visuals.  Glass, creatively enough, is the cinematography's constant focus, and I challenge you to find a single shot that doesn't include some form of glass or another. Breaking glass, privacy glass, Terry Glass.  You know, it looks really nice, but this kind of film could use a little more subtlety.  We also get a number of self-indulgent `Look, I'm a Director!' shots; i.e., a close-up shot of a dilating pupil, closet interior point-of-view, and of course, the dolly-in/zoom out `Vertigo' effect. Cliché after cliché is thrown in our faces.  `Hey, she keeps sketching at the dinner table.  Gotta wonder if that's gonna pay off later on.'  It's Sackheim's first try, and he doesn't let us forget it.  He wants badly to look like an artist, but his work is better suited to after-school specials.Leelee Sobieski was mediocre enough, but her name is Leelee, and I'm not sure how to feel about that.  After seeing her lead the Vaucouleurs against the Burgundians (as Joan of Arc) a couple years ago, I have a hard time watching her cry about being stuck in the home of a scary old Swedish guy.Speaking of scary old Swedish guys, Stellan Skaarsgard is actually cast pretty well.  Then again, anyone can be a dirty old man as long as they've got that lecherous grin.  However, just because he was cast well doesn't mean he doesn't take every opportunity to overact.  Even the dirtiest of dirty old men doesn't lurk in shadows and speak in hushed whispers all the time. I hereby bestow a `C-` upon `The Glass House.' Worth watching?  I suppose it depends on the time and place.  As I said before, `The Glass House' has `TV Movie' written all over it.  Therefore, my suggestion would be to wait until a network decides to air it a few years from now.  Until then, take your money and go see `Moulin Rouge' at the Basemar Cinema Saver.  Quality entertainment, I tell ya.

The girls can identify with the protagonist, while the boys can ogle the her, as she has several exploitative scenes. It's a bit of a clichéd, predictable thriller, but I doubt that teens will be very critical of it.Most of the movie is a cat-and-mouse game between the protagonist and her guardians. Throughout the movie, all the adult authority figures are shown to be useless. It's a cheesy tactic used in most teen thrillers so that the teen protagonists actually have something to do besides wait for an adult to save them. For adults, it often ends up seeming a bit forced and difficult to believe.Several of the characters are introduced and never appear again, like they were completely forgotten. It makes you wonder why they were even introduced. Most perplexing is the uncle, who I would have thought would have custody of his niece and nephew -- but, no, the parents decided to give custody to their next door neighbors! Bizarre. And, when things start to get weird with the next door neighbors, not a single person suggests living with the uncle. It's like everyone forgot that there's even any relatives still alive.If you're a kid, this movie probably works a lot better. You'll focus on the horror of losing your parents, living with creepy people that you barely know, and moving to a new city. Adults, however, will probably just be bored.

But the house also has lots of glass in it, so you can often see people in different rooms, and this plays into the story also.Leelee Sobieski was probably 17 during filming and plays 16-year-old Ruby Baker. Diane Lane is Erin Glass who in effect becomes her stepmother. Stellan Skarsgård is Terry Glass. Trevor Morgan is Ruby's kid brother Rhett Baker .As the two youngsters begin their new lives with the Glasses, in a fancy house on a small bluff above the ocean, things don't appear 'right' from the very beginning. It soon is very clear that the Glasses have some sort of sinister agenda. How Ruby and her brother cope with this is the movie.It was just 'OK' for us, we certainly would not see it again. It is filled with first-rate actors, so fault must go to the script and direction.SPOILERS To cut to the chase as they say, the kids' parents were thrifty and had an approximate $4 Million estate, the Glasses were in a big bind and needed that money. Terry Glass had 'loaned' the parents a car that fateful night and we conclude that the car was rigged to crash and kill them so that the Glasses could get custody and, ultimately the $4 Million for their own use.

In part this is due to the moronic final ten minutes but then you realize that the premise itself is the real problem. You don't mind suspending disbelief during the viewing but afterward you resent the fact that a less elaborate script would have made your efforts unnecessary. The film is yet another example of Hollywood's ability, given a relatively large budget $20-30 Million, to put together a good-looking and visually believable suspense movie. It brings skilled technique to a plot that's a foregone conclusion, so the viewer must wait patiently for the characters to catch up. For film buffs (those who like to read a film) there is a fairly ambitious subtext inside The Glass House; working on both conscious and sub-conscious levels. Warm (orange tones) lighting for the safe/secure scenes and cold (blue tones) lighting for the places where things are off-kilter. The Glasses (Diane Lane and Stellan Skarsgard) literally live in a glass house above the Malibu beach. The theme, that nothing is what it appears to be, is supported by a production design of reflective surfaces; mirrors, glass, and water (its always raining) that distort the images. Mrs. Glass is a physician in a pain center who is secretly addicted to her own medications. Mr. Glass runs a seemingly thriving limo service transporting famous clients behind smoked glass windows. There are several references to Hamlet with Ruby Baker (Leelee Sobieski) essentially in the role of the Melancholy Dane. The writer must have had this linked together much better in the screenplay but apparently several key elements of this dynamic never made it into production. This story is told entirely from Hamlet's point of view, a Hamlet who is frustratingly slow on the uptake and unable to make up her mind. And the viewer is supposed to be wondering what is real, what is wrongly perceived, and what is paranoid illusion. They even try to fool you with a dream sequence involving the return of Ruby's mother. Fortunately Sobieski (who looks like a young Helen Hunt) is an excellent actress and up to the challenge. Her performance (she is in every scene) keeps you focused on her story. The many scenes between her and Skarsgard are the film's real strength; they must carry the film since no one else in the cast is much of a factor. The film opens with a film with a film device, which turns out to be a horror film, late- night viewing for Ruby and her rave-loving high school friends. This is an early clue to the nothing is what it seems to be theme. It turns out that Ruby is quite a party animal and has been successfully deceiving her parents about her nocturnal activities. This night she returns home to find police cars parked outside her house. Believing herself finally busted she enters the house only to be told that her parent's were both killed in a car accident earlier that evening. This sets the stage for life with the Glass family, a childless couple who were friends with her parents. You instantly sense that they are odd, even those the director works so hard to make them appear normal that they come off as too nice. Ruby and her little brother, Rhett (Trevor Morgan) leave the San Fernando Valley to live with them in their hilltop house. Can you say Hansel and Gretel in a Gingerbread cottage? Things are weird from the start as the two children must share a room. Whatever the original rationale for this idea might have been, is lost in the deleted scenes of the screenplay and it just seems silly and illogical (given the Glasses long-term plans). I assume that it is included to reinforce the idea that living in a glass house offers no privacy but who knows. From this point a lot of stuff happens which can be taken in several different ways with the director constantly laying misdirection. Wesley Strick's screenplay gets way too elaborate and cute with this stuff and the film must rely on many convenient coincidences to advance the storyline. But since this starts at about the midway point its too late to stop viewing now. Listening to the Strick's commentary track on the DVD it is clear that there was considerable meddling with the original story by producers, dumbing down the more intellectually compelling elements. Still little would have been lost and the overall credulity would have benefited by a less ambitious conspiracy, there was no reason for the parent's deaths to have been anything but an accident; it would have raised the film's IQ if the Glasses had been opportunists rather than conspirators. And the attempt at irony with the brake fluid would have worked better if Mr. Glass had been knocked out and put in his car; only to wake up as it is speeding down the road. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

And I didn't regret. I think everybody who's interested can read the plot, so I won't stop telling what's the movie about.From the very beginning it's clear, that The Glass (especially Diane Lane, probably it's because of make-up or probably it's her play) are not good people, and it's really surprising that Rudy - an orphaned girl doesn't come to Chicago with her uncle Jack (Mr. Big from Sex and the City), but instead goes with the Glass to their glass house in Malibu.The house is what scares you in this movie most. It seems to be big and light and friendly from the first glance (it's made mainly of glass and similar material), but at night it becomes grave and dangerous. I think it's worth looking, and very unusual. It doesn't scare you with things like strange and scary noises, or sudden appearances etc. There's only lighting.Anyway being a quite interesting and suspicious thriller till the third quarter, when you try to guess the motives of The Glass' behavior, this movie just goes to the clichéd Hollywood lame, with maniacs arising from dead for the fourth time in a row and trying to kill you the main characters... It spoiled everything.I still say it's 6 of 10 because of Diane Lane's play, the house and quite interesting plot for the first 3 quarters of the movie.

I don't think it played in the theaters around here.Our story concerns the plight of a teenage girl and her little brother who are taken in by an up-scale couple after their parents are killed in a car accident. It doesn't take but a few minutes of screen time for our heroine (Sobieski) to come to the conclusion that their new guardians the Glass's are swine. Mr. Glass is a hot-shot car dealer who seems to owe a lot of cash to some underworld figures we never really learn that much about. Mrs. Glass is a drug addicted doctor played (in a fitfully distant manner) by Diane Lane. These two see the multi-million dollar trust funds of the kids to be a gold mine with which to keep their swanky Malibu house and a good supply of drugs in the medicine cabinet.No sooner do the kids move in then Sobieski starts formulating ideas on how to get herself and her brother the heck out of that house. She finds out time and time again that it's not always easy to outsmart the grown-ups. It's sometimes better to just sit back and let them destroy themselves.The film suffers from predictability and lack of credibility in the resolution of the conflict. That said, this is fiction so it shouldn't come as a big surprise if the film's creators were trying to keep the audience interested. There are a few tense and down right creepy moments sprinkled in, but the story as a whole never seems compelling.If nothing else, us guys can just sit back and enjoy seeing Leelee Sobieski for 106 uninterrupted minutes. I could probably think of a million worse ways to spend the time. That gal is so hot, she SMOKES!

The story revolves around Ruby Baker (Leelee Sobieski, Joy Ride), whose parents die in a horrible car accident. Scarred from the incident, Ruby and her brother, Rhett (Trevor Morgan), move in with their previous long-time neighbors and friends, Terry and Erin Glass (Stellan Skarsgaard and Diane Lane), in their luxurious glass home located in the hills on the California coast. Things seem normal enough at first, although Ruby isn't used to their kind of lifestyle - the Glasses can buy them literally anything they want. Rhett has a new Playstation and plenty of games, and Ruby is given a brand new Mac laptop, just to name a few of the items they've received. But the more time she spends at the house, she begins to realize that things aren't all cop-acetic, and that Terry and Erin aren't quite as friendly as they may appear, and that they might be holding a dark secret related to Ruby.While it is an admittedly predictable teenage thriller, The Glass House still manages to be consistently entertaining despite it's clichés and shortcomings. The storyline isn't anything too original - teen moves in with seemingly-friendly adoptive parents who may have ulterior motives. The same type of thing has been done before, so in that respect this film doesn't offer much of anything new. Is it clichéd? Yes, it surely is. Despite that though, it does have some nice touches to it and is never uninteresting at all. The way the story begins to unfold is predictable, and I knew what was going to happen next before it even happened, but I was still interested and entertained with it. But a large majority of films are predictable - doesn't mean they can't be enjoyable though.There is some nice cinematography in the movie, and the glass house itself is really an amazing set piece. Reflections, lightness, and darkness are all used in conjunction with the glass walls, and create an eerie atmosphere for the movie at appropriate times. The movie does lack real scares, but it's more of a thriller than anything so I suppose that's irrelevant. Just don't go in expecting it to be a full-blown horror movie, because it's not at all. The cast is led by Leelee Sobieski, and she is good enough to carry the film. Stellan Skarsgaard and Diane Lane play the two-sided foster parents, who are both friendly and menacing, as their characters should be. There are a few other familiar faces in the cast as well, including Trevor Morgan as Rhett, and Kathy Baker as a counselor/social worker. The acting in the film is overall pretty good. The movie's conclusion, as is a lot of other things in this film, is predictable, but it's satisfying as well so I can't really complain too much about it.The bottom line is, if you're tired of the typical teen thrillers out there, then you'll probably want to skip The Glass House. But if you don't mind movies of this type (or if you enjoy them), it's a very entertaining one and is worth a look. I'll rate it just one point above average because I personally enjoyed it despite it's predictability. 6/10.

So humor wasn't really necessary.Pros of The Film -It was interesting. -It showed Ruby's troubles and grief after her parent's deaths very well. -Rhett was awesome. -The acting was above averageCons of the Film -A bit too long -Boring sometimesOverall I thought the film was enjoyable and a little corny, but fun none the less. And a message for guys, if you want your girlfriend to hug your arm in fright while watching a horror film, I don't recommend the Glass House because it is more of a drama then a horror. I would recommend the new horror flick, 1408. That one is scary. But watch this film for a little fun.

With everything that Ruby and Rhett went through they never bothered to call Uncle Jack for help! The next and last time we see Uncle jack is at the end of the movie at the graveyard like we were first introduced to him; this shows just how disjointed the movie is. With their parents gone Ruby & Rhett are given, by the courts, into custody of the Glass' Terry & Erin, Stellan Skarsgard & Diane Lane. At first life could never be better for the kids but then strange things start to happen that made them at first feel uncomfortable and then terrorized by the couple. The nightly fights and the shooting up by Erin where she's left in a comatose state as well as Terry's involvement with the mob, he borrowed one million dollars from it, has put their lives in danger and they, or at least Ruby, want to leave the Glass House as fast as possible but where could they go and who could they trust? The Baker's estate lawyer Mr. Begleher, Bruce Dern,who according to the Baker's wishes had the Glass' take over the parenting of their underage children but he seems to also be involved in this scheme for the Glass' to defraud both Ruby & Rhett of the four million dollar inheritance that were left to them. What Mr. Begleher doesn't know is how much trouble his partner in crime, Terry Glass, is in with the mob wanting their cash that they loaned him, with interest, and how he's in the same situation that Terry is in by being his, unknowing, silent partner in the business that he has with the mobsters.The Glass House would be a so/so made for TV movie if it weren't for the breathtaking photography of the California Pacific Coast highway and the beautiful Malibu coastline, there's also the stunning 18 year-old Leelee Sobeski to gaze at, Leelee's midnight dip in the Glass' indoor swimming pool was by far the best scene in the movie. The story never really made that much sense in the fact why the two kids were so helpless in getting help since there were the police the school the social workers and last but not least the very willing and able Uncle Jack to turn to.With Erin Glass dead of a drug overdose and Terry dead drunk from guzzling down a fifth of Vodka Mr. Begleher come over to house to see him about the money that he can't seem to get his hands on from the Baker children thrust. It then becomes obvious that they, the Glass' & Begleher, had something to do with the Baker's death. Just then the two mob collectors Don & Whitey, Vyto Ruginis & Gavin O'Connor, drop over to get the cash that Terry owes their boss which he of course he doesn't have and you can just guess what happens after that.

It is my opinion that movies that run up to 3 hours should be important. Meaning, the universal story is not only a drama but a story that deals with the human experience or a historical event like a world war (Gone With the Wind, Dances with Wolves, etc.) The Glass House is far from anything serious or anything timeless. The movie's plot is about 3 minutes long with a story that most of the audience knew what was going to happen within the first 30 minutes. The pool scene is pure eye candy. The scene has nothing to do with the movie except for maybe some character development. Getting to see Leelee Sobieski in a 2 piece swim suit is one of the very few reasons to watch this move. After the first half of the movie, there is very little left to see. Overall, fast forward to the pool scene and get it over with. Final word...rent something else.

With all due respect, this doesn't strike me as a very relevant statement, because it's clear that Leelee Sobiesky is a massively talented actor, but The Glass House is simply a thriller that covers no new ground, and it doesn't even put any effort into being repetitive.The main problem that I had with The Glass House is that it's one of those thrillers that builds up and builds up and builds up and then just stops, like it forgot the climax. It is a creepy movie in that it contains characters, namely Terrance Glass, the parental guardian with serious money problems, who are so creepy as people that they are almost cartoonish. This is a man the likes of which exists nowhere on the face of the earth but in cheesy thrillers like The Glass House.Leelee Sobieski plays a teenage girl named Ruby whose parents are tragically killed in a car accident. When she and her younger brother are placed with foster parents, friends of the family, it becomes increasingly suspicious that they are the very people that killed them or had them killed. So this is where I get confused.The movie struck remarkably little interest with me, but from what I got, Terrance had the parents killed because he needed money, although we never really find out why. His living accommodations certainly do not suggest a lack of income. There were scenes where he was thrown against walls and whatnot by lowlifes who were demanding money, but my understanding was that they were demanding payment for pulling off the murder of the two parents.So here's my question, and I would appreciate anyone who can set me straight on the matter. Since Terrance and his wife can afford a house as massive as the one in which they live (as well as a variety of badass sports cars, which include a flashy Jaguar and a freaking Ferrari Testarossa), why are they in need of money, if not to pay off the killers? If the money is NOT to pay off the killers, why did they need money in the first place? Were they in debt? Was Terrance so in love with his Testarossa that he would rather have a close friend killed than sell it to help pay off his debt?I'm sure I'm just missing something there, so it doesn't really bother me too much, but Terrance's cheesy creepiness (consider, for example, the scene where he swerves recklessly into oncoming traffic and then skids onto the side of the road, only to reach over and buckle Ruby's seat belt as though everything's normal) by itself reduces the film the b-movie obscurity. Oh, and never mind the way he talks. Can't they create a bad guy without making him talk like Darth friggin' Vader?I can't say that The Glass House is not entertaining, because it is, but even that ends up counting against it in the end. The movie most certainly is intriguing, because it piques your curiosity as to why there is so much deception and murder in it, and we want to know the real motives and who the real killers are and all that (or if the parents were really killed at all), but like I said before, the movie builds up literally until the point where it ends, leaving us with the feeling that we just watched an entire movie waiting for a revelation that was never revealed. If you're in the mood for a thriller, watch Clay Pigeons or something. The Glass House plays like the script had a lot of stones thrown at it.

All of which makes `The Glass House,' directed by Daniel Sackheim, worth a look.  It's a road you've no doubt been down before, and pretty early on you have a good idea of where it's going to wind up; but it's well crafted and delivered, and serves as a showcase for Sobieski, who is one of the finest young actors in the business today.	When their parents are killed in a car wreck, sixteen-year-old Ruby Baker (Sobieski) and her eleven-year-old brother, Rhett (Trevor Morgan), find themselves under the guardianship of Terrence and Dr. Erin Glass (Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane), who are apparently well off financially, and have a rather nice house that sits on a cliff in Malibu, overlooking the Pacific Ocean.  It's seemingly an idyll setting, but from the moment the children move in the climate within the household seems uncomfortable to all but Rhett.  Ruby senses something disconcerting with the arrangement, but there's not much she can do about it.  The executor of the Baker's will, Alvin Begleiter (Bruce Dern), advises Ruby that if it doesn't work out with Mr. and Mrs. Glass, she and Rhett would become wards of the court; not a happy prospect.  It quickly becomes apparent to Ruby, however, that there's more than meets the eye at play here, but to whom can she turn?  And therein lies the conundrum, because the answer is a resounding `no one.'  And especially in the wake of her parent's death, that's a tough thing for a sixteen-year-old to have to face.  What she doesn't know, as well, is that it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better.	Director Sackheim does a good job of keeping up the tension in his film, but it could have been more effective had he employed a bit more subtlety and nuance.  And he has a troublesome affinity for camera shots through doors that are open just a crack, which allows one character (as well as the audience) to get a glimpse of another, as well as whatever is going on in the next room.  Initially, it works; but by the end of the film the impact it affords is diluted by overkill.  Things can only go bump in the night so many times, and you can only hold your breath so many times waiting for the eavesdropper to be discovered before it becomes second nature and ceases to be effective.  Even so, these are elements that can be overlooked, however, as Sackheim does keep it all moving along at a pace that sustains interest.  But the unimaginative ending is something of a letdown, and just too pat to ultimately have much of an impact.	The saving grace of the film is clearly Sobieski, who as she matures is emerging as a cross between Helen Hunt and Jodie Foster, but with a talent and style uniquely her own.  In Ruby, she delivers a well rounded, three dimensional character which, in lesser hands, could easily have fallen into stereotype.  Ruby, however, is anything but.  This is a girl who comes from privilege (money, private school), and like any normal teenager has a certain disdain for her parents.  She knows her way around and is not beneath sneaking out into uncharted territory occasionally.  Sobieski makes her extremely believable, especially in her reactions to all that happens to and around her.  The scene in which she learns of her parent's death is played very well, very real, as are the scenes in which her suspicions become increasingly aroused.  And it's that level of realism she attains and brings to the character that carries the film.	Diane Lane, on the other hand, does not fare as well.  Her performance as Erin is passable, but fairly weak.  She fails to bring anything to the role to make her character unique; it's as if she never quite got a handle on who this person really is that she's trying to portray.  To be fair, she does have her moments, but overall, her work here is average, at best.	In Terry, Stellan Skarsgard creates a character who is not so much sinister as down right creepy.  He lacks the menace that would've made Ruby's situation scarier, but in retrospect, his character is more real because of it.  And he has a slimy leer that is so very telling in regards to who Terry is.  Some of his actions at times seem too `staged,' like when he reaches across Ruby in the car to buckle her seat belt, but that falls on Sackheim, and is certainly not a reflection on Skarsgard's performance, which is quite convincing.	The supporting cast includes Kathy Baker (Nancy Ryan), Michael O'Keefe (David Baker), Rita Wilson (Grace Baker), Chris Noth (Uncle Jack), Rachel Wilson (Hannah), Michael Paul Chan (Mr. Kim) and Carly Pope (Tasha).  Though not the greatest movie ever made, this one still has something to offer by way of atmosphere, some suspense, a few thrills and a decent (if not highly original) story.  But the main thing `The Glass House' has to offer is the memorable performance by Leelee Sobieski, who takes this film to a higher level single-handedly.  In the final analysis, it's pretty straightforward storytelling, and it is entertaining; for a thriller, you could do much worse.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10.

This was generally 'hammered' by several reviewers, which sort of made up my mind to try it for myself. I was destined to see the 'Glass House'. It was calling me, like the cafe owner's microwave, in 'Amelie' (one of the best films of all time, by the way).I agree that there are no twists and the story is perfectly predictable. But doesn't this make it life-like? The very atmosphere of the film right from the start is perfect, with something of a 'twist opening' as opposed to final scene revelations. I think it must have been the spot-on editing which got this suspense yarn just right. Leelee is obviously a talented young actress (There are so many at present that I believe we are entering some sort of 'golden era' of female film acting - just take Thora Birch, Kirsten Dunst, etc). You know what's going to happen, but to still be as watchable as this does not amount to a duff movie. Shame on the reviewers.

The credible performances help keep it running.  Stellan Skarsgard gives another truly great, and very creepy, performance.  Leelee Sobieski is great as well, proving again to be one of our young talents with incredible potential.  Diane Lane is good, though I wish her character could've been developed better--especially the subplot about her drug habit, which I think might've been tempered to keep the PG-13 rating.  The music, I felt, was overdone.  It seems like the director depended too much on the creepy music to help set the tone.  The score is well-done, but at some times didn't seem appropriate.  Partially because whenever you hear the music you know something eerie is about to happen, and it just made the sequences all the more predictable.The film has some of the usual cliches in the genre.  People popping out of dark corners, people hiding in obvious locations (i.e.  under the bed) and not getting caught, people coming back to life after getting mutilated a couple thousand times.  But for some reason I really got into the film, and was able to look over those cliches and I actually didn't think much of them.  I guess there was a certain savviness to it, unlike a movie like What Lies Beneath where I burst out laughing during some scenes. This is not the smartest, most solid thriller ever made, but I had a real good time and I couldn't even hit the Pause button so I can go in the kitchen to grab a glass of water.

I had great hopes for Leelee Sobieski. I've only seen her once elsewhere, in Eyes Wide Shut, but I was completely knocked over by her beauty. Now, two or three years after she made that film, she seems to have gotten uglier. Well, she was shorter than Tom Cruise in EWS, but now she's taller than Stellan Skarsgard. I don't know. Her character is poorly written, so she has no real chance to give a decent performance. The only character given some meat is that of Skarsgard, but he delivers what can only be his worst performance in this film. I didn't despise this film, really. I was just bored.

Then skip The Glass House, yet another entry into this overgrowing yet popular series of movies that appeal to few, as the average critic's rating can show.Leelee Sobieski is Ruby Baker, a rebellious 16-year-old. Her brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan) is a typical 11-year-old who loves video games. One day, however, their parents die in a car accident and they are sent to live with family friends, Terry and Erin Glass (Stellan Skarsgård and Diane Lane). They have a huge Beverly Hills house made out of-you guessed it-glass. However, Ruby and Rhett's parents left over $4 million in inheritance, and could the Glasses be after that money, or is it Ruby's overacting teenage imagination? You get three guesses and the first two don't count.One or two tense scenes and good acting by one person does not a good movie make. The predictability of it all is just stunning, and, in case you couldn't tell some things, director Daniel Sackheim (TV's Kingpin) decided to show every single detail so we could understand what was happening. It's to my understanding that most movies are supposed to have a little air of mystery, a little cliffhanger, something to keep you guessing, to keep you enthralled. No such luck here, since everything here was so thudding obvious, it wasn't any fun to watch.One of the only good parts of an otherwise degrading film was Skarsgård. He is a powerful leading man (incidentally, his performance in The Glass House is similar to his performance in the subpar, 1997 Norwegian Insomnia), and it showed here, except he wasn't the lead. One of those supposed up-and-coming stars that fade out after their one `hit' when they're praised for their acting when actually they overact is Sobieski. She seemed excited to play a lead, and tried hard, but it just didn't work. Lane has almost no screen time, making her subplot about being addicted to insulin worthless.There were one or two tense scenes, but unsuspenseful scenes of mediocrity surrounded them. I think that since all of it was so predictable, that really killed the suspense. If you want to see a worse teen horror-thriller, see Swimfan. But if you want a mediocre one, then see The Glass House.My rating 5/10Rated PG-13 for sinister thematic elements, violence, drug content and language.

Her little brother, Rhett, was played by the same kid that played Scott Anspaugh for 5 episodes of ER.  They basically had the only two good parts in the movie.

These two have become the appointed legal guardians of Ruby Baker and her younger brother. They have just lost their parents to a car accident and are now moving in with the Glass'. The house is roomy and impressive, Ruby Baker doesn't feel much at home yet, but as least she is being provided for. Or is she? Slowly she starts to suspect that the Glass' are keeping something hidden, and the more she tries to find out, the more danger she is putting herself in along with her brother. She wants out, but she's got nowhere to go.With Hitchcock on its mind, The Glass House is stepped mostly in suspense and psychological camera-work. That and a well played rivalry between Leelee Sobieski and Stellen Skarsgaard make for a reasonably entertaining scary thriller, but sometimes it feels questionable. The plot uses contrived devices, the biggest of which you don't really notice till the very ending, at which point you realize that the whole scenario needs a rethinking. Another problem I have is that Skargard and Diane Lane don't go well together. Mrs. Glass is poorly characterized, and as a result, Lane has too little to work with, and she's not a good actress. Despite being in Sunny California, the obvious intention is to make you feel cold. this is sold to us in the style of lighting accompanied by an increase in rain, and a major lack of sunlight. The house itself is quite a piece of architecture. Again with all the glass and the lack of carpeting, this would be a cold place to live, and it spaciousness means that there arn't a lot of places to hide...not a good case scenario. The Glass House is strictly for fans of the genre, but even at that, it may only appeal to a small number of viewers. I'm not convinced it does a good job of suspending disbelief, but it does a good enough job of being chilling to make it watchable, maybe a good film for a rainy night (when it might be scarier to watch) "},{"Title":"Good film!

The heavy-handed direction forces the overripe style of the piece, while poor Bruce Dern (as the family lawyer, who keeps switching sides) and Kathy Baker (as a Child Protective Services agent, who is so easily bamboozled she makes all such agents look bad) get stuck with humiliating supporting roles--another fault of the screenwriter.
