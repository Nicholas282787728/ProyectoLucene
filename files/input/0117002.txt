[{"Title":"Underrated Film","Date":"5 February 1999","Score":"63 out of 71 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Romance","Review":"  This has to be one of the most maligned films of the past couple of years; it's virtually shoved under the carpet every time Julia Robert's career is mentioned and it's generally dismissed as a bore.  And in a lot of ways, it IS boring; not a lot happens during the course of the plot and as a horror film it utterly fails to provide a sense of urgency and fright in the conventional sense.It's also one of the most elaborate, mysterious and beautifully conceived big-budget fantasies committed to film.  The fact of its plodding storyline is, in a sense, besides the point of its true merit; that it is a dark, intensely brooding look at a woman's damaged sexuality and psyche and the oppressive times in which she existed.  The original Valerie Martin book ingeniously transmogrified the Robert Louis Stevenson story into an examination of a lost female soul who finds her redemption in a fog-shrouded hell.  Stephen Frear's film is in every respect a successful mood piece, a meditation on an individual's dark journey into not just a world of physical violence but her own crippled sense of selfhood and history of abuse.  More than most other contemporary films about the Victorian era, this film captures in meticulous and visceral detail the horrors of the Industrial Age---the poverty, the pollution-ridden streets filled with animal gore and filth, and the era's preoccupation/repulsion of the human body and the ominous glare of scientific knowledge gone awry in a society ill-prepared to meet the consequences. The cinematography and production design  (by the great Stuart Craig) are breathtaking.   A swinging door, partially obscuring the surgically opened corpse  on a table...Mary making her way through the streets of the market, surrounded by animal viscera...the shock of a roomful of a prostitute's remains, savagely gutted by a demonic hand...rats in the sewer, swarming into the crevices of Mary's mind...the Doctor's operating theater, like a coliseum of depravity...Mary, lost in the fog.These images were indelible to me and entertained my consciousness far more than any typical horror film could hope to.  Julia Roberts, for all her trouble with the Irish accent and going against her image as America's sweetheart, is the very picture of a haunted and ravaged soul, nearly destroyed by the abuse and poverty of her childhood and bewildered by the mysterious machinations of her homicidal employer.  She lends a great deal of vulnerability and conviction to her role and carries the film in ways beyond dialogue and posturing.  Not once does she flash her trademark million-dollar smile but what she gives to the film is far more valuable than glitz and in her looks and inflections reveals more on-screen than most of her other films combined.This film won't appeal to most people.  And admittedly, it does fail in so many ways that a lot of audiences will be turned off. A lot of people will definitely be bored to tears by the slow pace and what the H*ll is happening?!?!? quality of the narrative. But for viewers who liked Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast, Neil Jordan's Comany of Wolves Caleb Carr's book The Alienist or perhaps Ken Russell's Gothic, this is worth a try.  It should not be written off as just another big-budget Hollywood failure, because its aims, whether conscious or not, are quite different from your average thriller or period film.   Approach it with an open mind, be prepared for a dark and disconcerting vision, and you might be rewarded because this film is unique, baroque, different and great.

I figured I was the only person who actually liked this film. All the national critics sure hated this low-key re-telling of Jekyll and Hyde.The muted colors with the grey overtones caught my eye and were very interesting to observe. Julia Roberts also was interesting to watch no makeup, no smile, just sad, somber looks yet still appealing. Despite critics' comments to contrary, I found this an intelligent adaption of the famous story.People don't care for subtly in films anymore. They want in-your-face smash- ups, gore, violent contrasts....and a lot of it. This movie is extremely low-key and subtle, although there are some bloody scenes.I have to admit that I agree with one criticism, that it's hard to believe Roberts' character Mary Reilly would not recognize Jekyll from Hyde (played by John Malkovich) when he didn't change facial appearances! And, yes, the film, generally- speaking, is a real downer, a depressing tale. Yet, for some odd reason, despite the above paragraph, I recommend the film to people who enjoy slower films and subtle suspense, even if they have to suspend a little believability. I thought it was oddly fascinating.

It's a movie of subtleties and moods.  Its dark themes deal with the oppression of a strict, class-based society in Victorian England as well as the secrets that we all hide inside our hearts. The familiar tale takes intriguing new turns from the viewpoint of the house's servants.  John Malkovich, while a tad thin on his English accent, delivers a fantastic performance as both Jekyll and Hyde as he plumbs the depths of morality and the human soul.  Hyde is a stark contrast of freedom among the restrained servants of the Jekyll house, and his subtle sexual innuendoes quietly violate the chastity of Victorian stereotypes.  Much of the violence occurs off camera until near the climax of the film, which may be one of it's shortcomings.  The film is very quiet and slow and may put some viewers to sleep.  Another issue I had was the lovely Henson-Workshop-provided effects at the end, which are imaginative, but don't make a bit of sense when compared to the rest of the film.  If you can stomach a quiet and very subtle thriller, however, this is a real gem.

The fact that Julia Roberts was in it also was another obstacle. Yet as other reviewers have mentioned, she actually gives a good performance. John Malkovich is excellent as the tormented Jekyll/Hyde character.The cinematography and moods are haunting. One feels they are actually re-living the Victorian era, where the servants woke up at 4AM to complete their drudgery. The kitchen conjures up the stark realities of survival, the eel that is chopped up for dinner (while alive) Mary Reilly turns white as a sheet as she sees the animal die. I actually began to appreciate Ms. Roberts' performances more after this film (also in films like Mona Lisa Smile, she projects a certain believability; is not just a physical presence). At one point, there is a most effective scene wherein Roberts must see to her mother's burial, and goes to the tenement to make arrangements. The landlord has placed her mother's body in a damp cellar closet, saying she is most comfortable as he hands her one shilling, the only money Roberts will inherit. Roberts then says; ...ä poor wage for a lifetime of drudgery... We are reminded of the workhouses of Dickens, and the rigid class structures which she must survive...While the dialect is at times choppy, she is believable as an Irish maid; and the supporting cast also lends credence to this story. Malkovich varies his performance between Jekyll/Hyde, and it is effective and visceral.If you initially avoided this film, I would highly recommend seeing it now. The atmosphere and music are haunting and sad. 9/10 "},{"Title":"Julia Roberts in a horror?

Often criticized as boring and a low point in Julia Roberts career, I found it to be a great Gothic story.  While I can understand and see why people were put to sleep by the film, I think it's a refreshing change of pace from the standard popcorn flick that is only interested in being the number 1 film at the box office Monday morning.  John Malkovich turns in a great performance of the Jekyll/Hyde character, and Glenn Close steals the few scenes she's in as a Madame of a brothel.  Julia Roberts plays against type as a dour chambermaid, and I think that's what put off so many people.  Obviously, most people like their Julia flashing her now $20 million dollar smile.  I say, good for you for trying something different.

Mary is a traumatized woman that was abused by her father when she was a child and very devoted to Dr. Jekyll. One day, he gathers Mr. Poole and the servants in a room and tells that his assistant Mr. Edward Hyde will be work in his laboratory with free access to the house.

John Malkovich as always played both Jekyll and Hyde with the passion and intensity that i have come to expect from him.I'm not much for period dramas but I have to admit that it was done so brilliantly and didn't feel stuffy and controlled like a lot of other period films I have tried watching. The story of Jekyll and Hide and it has been done in other films but this is one of the best I have seen. The film had a lot more feeling to it but was very subtle and made me think a lot of things through. The film has a slow pace compared to some but this isn't such a bad thing, it definitely didn't feel drawn out, it seemed to have enough time to venture down all the paths it needed including the death of Mary's mother.The film is classed partly as horror but the only part of the film which was scary to see was the scene where Mary witnesses Hde become Jekyll for the first and last time. The special effects were a little out there compared to the rest of the film, it was almost like someone put a microwave in Dr Jekyll's Victorian kitchen. It would have been better to see there faces gently merge from one character to the other.Other than that all I have to say is this is a brilliant film.

What's an American accent doing in the middle of all this? Malkovitch also seems to be channeling his own performance in Frear's masterpiece, Dangerous Liaisons - but if you haven't seen that film you should love what he does in this one.But other than that, I found the slow pace to be totally gripping... The entire story is told from the viewpoint of Mary Reilly, and I have never seen Julia Roberts do a better job than here. She is wonderfully effective... it is worth watching this film only for her performance. But it is also worth watching because of the attention to period detail. You really get a feeling of what it must have been like to live in the 19th century. The manners, the utensils, the class differences...the psycho-sexual straight-jacket.I will not give any details about the film - I'll let those who watch it discover it for themselves. But I would like to say one thing about the pace. This is not an action film, it is not even a horror film in the traditional sense. It is mainly a story of discovery - dealing with the slow realization of hidden desires and uncontrolled motivations; as such it should not - nay, could not be done at a quicker pace. It's really too bad that fewer and fewer people today seem to be capable of watching something that is subtle and slow. The loss is theirs. "},{"Title":"What do I like about this film?","Date":"1 September 2010","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Romance","Review":" I really like the fact that the film is told from Mary Reilly's point of view. Not only hers, but everyone else's too, like the naive servants, the furious Mrs. Faraday (the brothel mistress). Mary Reilly - the character - also has a disturbing, traumatizing background story and at some point Mr. Hyde gives a pretty heavy psychological spin on it. It's never elaborated on or seems ignored even, but this suits the tone of the film. Insinuating things often hits harder than explaining them. Through some of the characters, some of the possible little script flaws (or plot holes) get solved. For instance, doesn't anybody notice that Dr. Jekyll and his assistant Mr. Hyde look very much alike? Only Hyde looks younger. Sure people notice this, but one of the servants goes about assuming that Mr. Hyde might very well be a product of Jekyll's student days. As a bright student, Jekyll was popular with the ladies. And since Jekyll never got married, if he would have had a son... in those days it was even a sin to merely speak about or suggest a thing like this.I like John Malkovich's performance a lot and it's clear that him & Stephen Frears both understood very well what they wanted to achieve here. The good doc Jekyll (whom is looked upon in high regards by his servants) is far from kosher to the bone himself (we get hints at how he conducts his research and we know he's a regular client at Mrs. Faraday's house of pleasure). While on the other hand, Mr. Hyde as the savage beast, has his scarce moments of weakness for Mary Reilly. See what I'm getting at? And when looking at it from Mary's side, she unwillingly brings out the worst in the best, and the best in the worst, so to speak. Frears & Malkovich and screenwriter Christopher Hampton added shades of gray to a classic, one too many times told story that is basically just about black & white. The film got me really interested in reading the source novel it was based on. To see how it compares the film.What else is there to like? Enough, I think. Phillipe Rousselot's wonderful cinematography. A captivating musical score by George Stenton. As much as it's a character-driven story, it does feature a handful moments of the grotesque. Glenn Close gets decapitated. Dr. Jekyll is seen on the street repeatedly kicking a little girl in the stomach. An engrossing scene that shows how slaughtered meat for consumption is being traded in the streets, followed by an analogy towards the trade of human organs for the sake of science. Not sure whom all were responsible for these sequences -- I understand that Frears, for example, never intended the film to end like it did, with that climactic transformation sequence. But said sequences are a graphic reminder of the fact that we are watching a horrific story. At any rate, I didn't think they hurt the film. They injected it with the necessary dosage of brutality.The set design is marvelous and Dr. Jekyll's laboratory - or at least the way of getting there - is cleverly structured (as it helps crafting the suspense of a certain scene in a brilliant manner). The 19th century London setting works convincing, but we don't get to see much of it. The blocking & framing makes sure we usually only see one part of a street at a time. And to add to this claustrophobic & dark notion this film has, most scenes take place on indoors sets. But also these sets are put to great use. To Mary Reilly, the doctor's mansion starts off as a safe haven, a place offering a good job and a possible better future. But it doesn't take long for this house to get infested with the evil of Mr. Hyde's presence at night. So much even, that it starts to haunt her dreams. This shift in tone happens gradually, with a slow but impeccable pace.Truth be told, to me Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde always seemed a very simplistic story to tell. At least in the classic version as it got famous. It's good source material, yes, but Frears & Hampton managed to squeeze a much more interesting film out of it. Which probably could have even been a lot better if the producing studio at the time wasn't so concerned about how it would do at the box office.Voilà, that's it for what I like about this film.Notice that I didn't mention Julia Roberts' performance. It's very down-toned, as it should be. She is there not to be noticed, her character demands it and so does the story. And while she does have a lot of screen time, she doesn't do much, so there's just not much to say about her acting. But you can always 'see' the wheels of her character's thoughts grinding, as she is the only one who's trying to fathom what's going on. From all the servants, she's the only one that knows how to read. Dr. Jekyll discovers this very early on, when he spots her reading a book in his library. This, of course, titillates the good doc's mind. And that's the point in the film, as soon as it comes, where you instantly realize this is going to take a turn for the worse. In that moment, there's a harmless thing between them that will inevitably unleash unspeakable horrors. And this 'harmless thing' even is personified throughout the whole film. It goes by the name of Mary Reilly.A very interesting adaptation. And a good film, full stop.

More power to its fans!Mme Roberts' performance has here very fine qualities&#151;qualities of restraint and self-effacing that work for the movie and also reveal in a very effective way Mme Roberts' high understanding of her art .She is very good.It also absolutely revealed to me Malkovich as the extremely fine actor that he is. There are, for me, two films that exquisitely showcase Malkovich's art&#151;this Jekyll, and a Tournier adaptation, made by a German director (The Ogre ,by Volker Schlöndorff). These are two movies that I enormously admire.They are strikingly achieved films,and also very good parts, and I much prefer them to Malkovich's roles in The Glass Menagerie (1987) ,Shadows and Fog (1992),Of Mice and Men (1992),Con Air (1997) ,Al Di Là Delle Nuvole (1995),Les Misérables,etc..Yet the best thing in this Reilly is its visionary nature and visionary sense&#151;in the psychological sense. It has this surreal visionary gusto that I've appreciated the most. It plays like a film that sets itself up for something. I guess the famous critics couldn't reduce it to any political/_deconstructivist /academic agenda&#151;Reilly is a mere vision&#151;so it meant nothing to them! Fortunately, Reilly doesn't look mainstream in the Hollywoodian way&#151;it really is of an independent, original conception. It's violent and attractive and intense and compact.The usual thesis is that Stevenson meant evil and good can cohabit in the same human individual. Yet Chesterton once rectified this and wrote no, on the contrary, Stevenson obviously meant evil and good can't cohabit in the same person. The first will devour the second.Reilly has some kind of a visionary life and liveliness. Also a force.

Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a horror story, true, but Mary Reilly is not. What Valerie Martin did with the book was to take the story, and instead of exploring the conflict in Harry Jekyll, exploring the psyche of the broken servant girl, and gives an interesting view into life as it was for the underclass in the Victorian London.Mary Reilly is the soft spoken and demure chambermaid who works in the house of the rather eccentric Dr. Harry Jekyll. He is a gentle man and shows an interest in Mary's story in a way that she is not used to from her masters. At the same time she is fascinated by the uncivilized and crazed fervor of the master's assistant, Edward Hyde.The scenery and imagery is eerie and elusive, and at the same time visceral and physical and it is constantly covered in the smog of the industrial age. There is no attempt to pretty up the destitution and the physical and moral corruption of London in the Victorian age, a contrast to many other period pieces as they show the Victorian age as something elegant and romantic. This is dirt and gold side by side. Examples are the trip down butcher alley with Edward Hyde and the sight of the autopsy slab through the swinging doors. This also counts as some of the most unpleasant scenes to watch, but there is also a few hints of gore in this. The prostitute's bedroom is nauseating.Julia Roberts is good in this role, dodgy accent aside, I think it is so annoying to hear people continue to rant about it. Yeah the accent is crap, but is easy to disassociate from if you try. I think that Roberts give a very good performance, her eyes are haunted, and her body language speaks of a cowed spirit. There is tuned down from the Hollywood glamour, and it really suits her.John Malkovich is absolutely spectacular, the lack of attempt on an English accent I barely thought of. He is gentle and soft spoken as Jekyll, yet all the time with a glitter of madness in his eyes, it's wonderful. Yet he is perfect as Mr. Hyde, the madness, the brutality, his coarseness, a man completely enslaved by his urges. John Malkovich smoothly glides through both roles Other memorable performances is Glenn Close as the greedy brothel owner, and Michael Gambon as Mary's monstrous father, he's a man of one's nightmares.I thought Mary Reilly such a fascinating film because it is so phycological, a person with a little knowledge of Freud and Jung will be to see that parallels in the story to their theories. Exactly why I don't consider it a problem that Jekyll and Hyde are not difficult to separate in their looks. They are supposed to be two sides of the same person, while they also have a little bit of the opposite in them. The idea of Jekyll and Hyde being the two projectors for Mary's desire is ingenious, the gentle and the ferocious, the safety drive and the sex drive. Well the story has so many psychological layers that it is hard to dissect them all.The ending was the perfect round up of the story, very poignant and moving. This film is not for those people who wants a gorish horror movie with everything served. This film is for people who does not mind a slow pace, but likes to savor the characters and the mood of this. Mary Reilly is a truly underrated psychological drama, and while it's not an actual horror film in my opinion, it does has some very nerve wrecking suspenseful moments.

She should have either stayed with the bad Irish accent or her natural dialogue because it drove me crazy as she went back and forth between the two. You could tell by looking at her face during the movie that she was way over her head. She was expressionless and emotionless throughout the film. This performance ranks right up there with Tinkerbelle as Julia's worst performance ever.John Malkovich was solid as Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde. He was not near as good as Fredric March in the 1931 version, but that is way too high of a measuring stick. I was somewhat districted from his performance by the awful job Julia Roberts was doing. I kept trying to guess if her next line would be an Irish or an American accent.The story could have been very interesting. It comes from a different point of view from the Robert Louis Stevenson novella. It tells the story of a woman who finds herself trying to choose between failing for the noble Dr. Jekyll or the infamous Mr. Hyde. It draws into a different side of human nature because a lot of women tend to be drawn to the dangerous type. Unfortunately, this movie called for a strong actress to play Mary Reilly and they were stuck with Julia Roberts.One other issue that some might have with this film is you really must see a traditional version of Jekyll and Hyde first. The movie would probably be fairly hard to follow if you didn't because the movie assumes that you know the Jekyll and Hyde background.Finally, I will leave on a positive note. The settings were nice and atmospheric.Overall, I recommend that you avoid this film and watch the Rouben Mamoulian classic instead. "},{"Title":"The film Mary Reilly is a shipwreck of reason.","Date":"1 November 2000","Score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Romance","Review":"  True fans of Julia Roberts may wish to experience this film. No doubt one's love for her previous efforts will allow one to find this trash as personal treasure. All others should give this film a wide berth. We are meant to suspend disbelief and assume Julia Roberts to be Dr. Jeckyl's hard-working Irish maid who survived child abuse with scar tissue and is now forced into perpetual servitude, yet still able to look this good.The predominant evidence to Roberts' being miscast is her inability to retain an Irish accent throughout the film. Just once didn't the director think to stop and film a scene until Roberts got it right? Roberts would seem to occasionally add accented inflection as an afterthought. I hope they never cast her as Eliza in a remake of Pygmalion! Julia Roberts portrays confusing emotions throughout the film. Fear, disillusionment, frustration, and surprise all appear to register on Roberts' face as the same emotion. Wide eyes with lips that almost part and eyebrows that almost remarkably remain motionless. In fact, much of Roberts' time in the film is spent tentatively peering through some portal with her shining face looking for a shadow to hide behind, as she views something off camera which is never truly as horrific as a horror movie should be. To be fair, the sets and the costuming are superb. The sound is satisfactory, but not memorable. That's about the best I can compliment this film. While a film of the horror genre, it also vainly strives to be a romance, an intense melodrama and near the end even cheesy science fiction. The end result is this film doesn't know what it wants to be. Therefore it plods away with the pacing of a cadaver, stagnating in its own refuse.John Malkovich must be incredibly confident in his talent to have given such a terrible performance here. I have seen him do far better with far less. Perhaps Malkovich knew that in this script, the parts of Jeckyl and Hyde are merely supporting roles that take a backseat to what is inherently a Julia Roberts star vehicle, and he took that to heart. This film's Hyde appears to be perhaps ten years younger than Jeckyl, and clean-shaven. We're never meant to truly understand what diabolical serum turns the one man into the other, but I imagine it involved a pint of guiness followed by a vodka chaser, and either shaving cream or rogaine, depending on the need. That is the extent of the difference visually. The rest is dependent upon Malkovich's performance as a kind elderly gentleman in the part of Jeckyl and a sinister rebellious delinquent in the part of Hyde. Malkovich rises up to this challenge by not rising at all. Instead he reads his lines alternatively wooden or melodramatic. He is the villain because it is his part to play except of course when it is not. Then he is a misunderstood lover unrequited or a man hiding angst and longing. We are meant to feel pity for him, but we end up feeling indifferent. It is explained to us why Jeckyl has invented Hyde. He struggles with demons within that perhaps we all have to some degree, only he was trying to control his and use it affect freedom from the captivity of his humdrum existence. One can't help but think that all Jeckyl truly needed was spontaneity. His reasons for unleashing this monster have not enough weight to carry the film. Further, this monster he unleashes turns out to be simply a man of amoral virtues who doesn't pass for a gentleman by cultured 19th century standards. I mean in the 20th century Mr. Hyde would fit in quite well in a reality cops tv show as a man police take into custody. He's no monster. He's no madman. He's just a common criminal, and a boring one at that; like a kleptomaniac who steals lives. Diseased or merely selfish, he deserves what he gets.  Glenn Close appears laughably in what appears to be a man in drag with far too much makeup, making her performance as Cruella DeVille in 101 Dalmatians Oscar material by comparison. In Mary Reilly, she portrays The Madame Farraday, who being the manager of a nearby prostitution ring, naturally (stereotypically) has dealings with Hyde and cleans up after his antisocial outings, only to be surprised when this backfires. Close performs her role as if she knows her fate, and sneers and jeers at everything around her; there obviously for her own entertainment and amusement certainly not ours. The other performers are inconsequential to the plot or the atmosphere, and quite unremarkable. The premise sounds solid on the surface, but like a wet paper towel it breaks under any strain. The casting was misguided. The dialogue is weak. The script itself is bland where it should have been melodramatic and vice versa. The interaction between characters always appears forced and rarely builds from the logic of the moment. The motivations shown of Reilly's childhood horror appear more scary than her present plight, and cause one to wonder why she doesn't just turn tail and run. Yet towards the end we realize it is because she actually likes it when she's punished and broken. She *wants* to be Hyde's victim. This realization could have been an audience shocker, but instead it's a yawn. There's a bad joke that comes to mind. The masochist says to the sadist, hurt me please. The sadist says to the masochist, no. This is what happens to the leads in this film. Nothing. And yet they seem content with that.

I had remembered hearing things about this film, not exactly good things, but since I had nothing better to do, I sat back and watched this Julia Roberts - John Malkovich film.      Mary Reily is basically one big gimmick wrapped in a treatment of a classic tale.  The whole film deals with house maid Mary Reily's dealings with Dr. Henry Jeckyl and Mr. Edward Hyde.  The whole gimmick is the fact that this film is supposed to be the woman's take on the story.  Let's just say that while this gimmick might have been a good one, it is pulled off in the worst way imaginable.  Which is disappointing to me, because any film that starts off with an eel being graphically butchered would usually be alright in my book (kidding).  I don't want to give anything away about the film, but you probably know the whole story anyway, if you have been paying attention to classic literature at all.  I think it would just be easier going through everything that is wrong in this movie.      First of all, let me start on the performances in Mary Reily.  It seems to me that literally every one of the actors/actresses took a seminar before shooting on one-note acting.  Not one character in the film conveys more then one emotion in the whole film, even with Dr Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde, amazingly enough.  Julia Roberts (Mary Reily) is the worst of the cast, this was also during her dry spell before My Best Friend's Wedding brought her back to superstardom.  I had no idea she was supposed to have an Irish brogue until 20 minutes into the movie, and after that her accent changes about every four sentences...downright horrid.  In addition to the in flux accent, she is the second worst offender of the one-note acting.  She expresses one emotion, sadness as depression, nothing more then that, although she does do this thing with her eyes alot that is supposed to show horror, I think.  The worst offender of the one-note acting is John Malkovich.  In one case, this sort of acting works, and his portrayal of Dr. Henry Jeckyl is one of the two redeeming values in this film.  He plays Jeckyl as if he is a shell for a true inner being that lurks beneath his skin, and he does it with great subtlety.  Then his Hyde comes out and you realize that his Hyde is almost the same performance as his Jeckyl, except kicked up a notch or two.  Don't even get me started on Glenn Close as brothel leader Mrs. Farraday, who is in the film only a short time, but threw off every scene she was in, actually making the movie worse then it already was, with her acting style of sneering at anything said to her.  When she leaves, you note that the film rises in quality only a little.  The rest of the performances are of the same school, one-note acting to show their stance on Mary Reily's actions.  That was the most upsetting thing in the whole movie, but trust me there are more flaws.      The screenplay by Christopher Hampton, is so unbelievably straight forward and boring that every line in the film is completely unimbellished.  What I mean by this is that the majority of the dialogue consists of one to three sentences.  Which really doesn't help with any character development, although there is a little, but you barely notice it because the performances hinder the development very much.  It also doesn't help that the screenplay adds a completely unnecessary sub-plot involving Mary Reily and her parents, there was absolutely no reason for them to be there.  The other thing about the screenplay that is very odd is the fact that while Dr. Jeckyl is the film a fair amount, Mr. Hyde is treated as cameo-length character, which just confuses me even more.  There is one other thing that I liked about Mary Reily, that was the Set Design by Stephanie McMillan and the overall Production Design by Stuart Craig, this is the most impressive thing in the whole film, showing both gothic and classic styles at once.  The final thing, which I really can't say too much about because of my lack of knowledge of Stephen Frears other works, but the pacing during the early scenes is just bizarre, but it straightens itself about a half hour into the movie.  I am not sure how much of this film can be blamed on Frears himself, because other then the early pacing problems, I couldn't find too many glaring problems.      Overall I would say that everyone should avoide wasting about 2 hours on this film.  It isn't even good for a laugh, because of it's overly serious tone.  Even fans of Frears, Roberts, Malkovich and Close should stay far away from this thing and keep your respect for these professionals.My Rating  2/10       "},{"Title":"The only thing that grabbed me when I saw this film was my girlfriend begging me to turn it off.","Date":"6 October 1998","Score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Romance","Review":"  This movie was very boring.

In fact, whichever way you look at it; this should have been a better film. The story of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is a great base for a story, and it's shocking to see that this is all that could be mustered. I don't know if Valerie Martin's novel is any better; but given the fact that a film was made of it, I'm inclined to think that it is. The film sees the shocking transformation of Dr Jekyll into Mr Hyde from the point of view of the good doctor's maid, who just so happens to be called Mary Reilly. This is interesting because is shows the story we already know from a different perspective, thus giving it new life; but it loses so much in terms of the focus of the actual story; things such as the reasons for the experiments, and the crimes committed by Mr Hyde aren't touched on at all, and that means that any interest generated by change of perspective is swiftly cancelled out.The film stars Julia Roberts, who takes the lead role. It's not a good performance from her; the atmosphere around her gives the impression that she's either uncomfortable or bored (or both), and that ensures that she's never much fun to watch. The usually brilliant John Malkovich takes the double role of Dr Jekyll and his alter ego, and even he fails to make an interesting go of it. He's this film's biggest asset - but his performance loses credibility due to the fact that Mr Hyde is OBVIOUSLY the same person as Dr Jekyll! The fact that it's based on a story we all know doesn't help the film where the plotting is concerned. The audience knows that Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde are different versions of the same man - and that means we are left waiting for the characters to catch up. Mary Reilly makes this dramatic irony it's centrepiece, and it's not a good move as any intrigue is killed before it has chance to get off the ground. To be fair, the film does a few good moments of suspense - but these are few and far between, and all I can recommend doing with this film is missing it, and seeing either Rouben Mamoulian's 1931 classic, or the hilarious Hammer take; Dr Jekyll and Sister Hyde!

This is not a horror tale, and the violence and gore are kept to a minimum. In some sense it is a love story, but only in the most general of terms. More accurately, it is a woman who is loyal to her employer.The strangest thing about this is how little they tried to make the two halves look different. When Hyde comes out, he is still obviously Malkovich. How can they not notice? Someone remarks that they bear a resemblance, but it is much more than that.

Seen almost twenty years later, the problems that it had back then are still apparent today. Actually, in many ways it is a well made movie. Director Stephen Frears does manage to capture the cold and bleak feel of London in the Victorian era. And the two headline stars, Julia Roberts and John Malkovich, do give perfectly fine performances. Unfortunately, the central story of the movie simply isn't that interesting. The movie has the promising idea of telling the very familiar Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story from an observer's point of view, but it's told in such a slow style and not terribly exciting or intriguing. (It also doesn't help that what Hyde does in his various rampages for the most part remains unclear.) As I indicated, the movie has some good features, but all the same it ends up being one case where the book is a lot better.

Thankfully, this turgid mess bombed at the box office so we were spared sequels about Dracula's chauffeur, Frankenstein's tax attorney and the Wolfman's proctologist.Mary Reilly (Julia Roberts) works as a maid for Dr. Henry Jekyll (John Malkovich) in 19th century London. I kid you not when I state that this movie essentially follows Mary around while she does her household chores and every so often we get a scene that peeks in on the classic tale of Jekyll and Hyde. If you don't know what that story's about, go down to the damn library and check out the book or watch one of the 37,000,000,000 other versions of the tale that have been committed to film. Basically, this thing is a Cliff's Notes version of Jekyll and Hyde, crossed with a documentary on the brutal drudgery of 19th century working class Britons, mixed with a Lifetime movie about a woman overcoming her memories of fatherly abuse.The heart of Mary Reilly is supposed to be about the attraction Mary feels for both Jekyll and Hyde and the affection they feel in return. A big problem is that it's hard to believe any man being lovestruck by this pale-faced woman with Conan O'Brien eyebrows. Julia Roberts is deliberately stripped of most of the beauty artifice that props up her appearance in other films and the audience is undeniably confronted with the fact that Roberts is not that pretty. She has very distinct features that need to be accommodated on screen and that doesn't happen here.Another defining negative about this film is very poor acting jobs by three big stars. Roberts intermittently adopts an Irish accent that rivals Kevin Costner's dialect in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves for its now you hear it, now you don't quality. John Malkovich does worse than sleepwalk through his double role, even giving Edward Hyde an extremely pronounced limp early in the film which completely disappears later on. Either Malkovich and director Stephen Frears both forgot about the limp or Malkovich just got tired of doing it and Frears couldn't make him. Glenn Close is almost as bad as the owner of a London brothel. Her entire performance consists of giving her character an Elvis lip curl.The bottom line is that Mary Reilly is a movie about an uninteresting woman who stands still while an amazing story happens around her. The idea of telling a famous tale from the perspective of a minor character isn't a bad one. A movie about the London cop trying to track down and capture Edward Hyde sounds good to me. The trick is the minor character actually has to do something important in the story. Mary Reilly simply hovers and watches like the boring person on a reality show.Unless you're dying to view YET ANOTHER crappy adaptation of Jekyll and Hyde, skip this film.

But the thing is at time distance i usually get a good impression of it, and my memory retains good opinion regarding it. But while i watch it, and i've done it a few times, i don't find reasons to match my remembrances of previous viewings. I thought about it and i think it all comes down to one element, which is Malkovich. Julia Roberts is useless, she's an ornament, the girl who is there to get scared and perform the walk in the dark facing her own fears and beating them role. OK with it. Not so OK when she is supposed to provide our Hyde with a background and lend him her fears and bad memories, she fails completely and that's a weak point. Frears direction is correct, he understands pace and how to build a film respecting the mood of the script. Everything OK. Than we have Malkovich. He has a way of performing which many times gives the sensation that he is not performing at all, as if he was always being him. This is a false sensation and, in most cases, i think this works as a positive aspect of his performances. Somehow it provides him with a sensation of several layers, that of the character he performs, himself and the way he understands that character, almost as if he was always making personal annotations on what he feels about his characters (strangely this vanishes in his performances for Oliveira's films, but that's another story). Here in this film this aspect works out differently. On the one hand he doesn't establish the radical opposition between Jekyll and Hyde that one might need to watch. On the other hand this brings out the inner connection between the two, and the observation that anyone contains Jekyll and Hyde, and the establishment of ones personality is the resolution of that inner conflict. This very conflict is the one that Malkovich carries into his performance (actor versus character comparable to Jekyll versus Hyde). This is probably what confuses me and probably the most interesting element to observe in the film.My evaluation 3/5, solid work, weak points but interesting element, as referred.http//www.7eyes.wordpress.com "}{"Title":"Stephen Frears'is masterpiece","Date":"19 June 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Romance","Review":" I loved this film.

The performances are not at fault, nor is the very accurate looking Victorian look of the fog-bound London streets and the costuming of the entire cast. It definitely has the right brooding atmosphere and look.But somehow, it never comes to life. Perhaps because there's no spark to Roberts' performance, all very muted and one-key with eyes downcast in maidenly humility and later, in wide-eyed fear. But it's JOHN MALKOVICH who is the more interesting character (not surprisingly) as the Dr. Jekyll she works for and gradually (very gradually I might say) comes to suspect has a darker side.Sometimes it pushes all the right buttons and there's an air of menace hanging over even the quietest moments thanks to the brooding atmosphere and subdued photography. But it never quite becomes imaginative enough to pull off the story with any real finesse. It's a disappointment, the kind of story that should linger in the memory, but doesn't.

I couldn't tell you what it was supposed to be, but whatever it was, I doubt there was ever anyone anywhere in the British Isles that talked like that. Accents aren't the most important of things, but when your leads provide so little else for you to care about, things like accents come into focus, and Roberts, Malkovich and Close all fail on this score. All three of them just seem so out of place in so many ways. The only relief in sight in this film comes from some of the small roles. Bronagh Gallagher is good. Michael Gambon has a tiny and nasty role, but at least he's convincing. I'm also convinced that the best moment in the film comes when the the MP walks up behind the tedious Julie Roberts' character at the brothel and pushes her out of the camera's view! Sadly, that was how much I cared about the film's main character.

Yeah, the pacing is not good. Yeah, Julia Roberts is a slight problem. But there are three more massive problems with the movie.1) Viewpoint - Telling the story of Hamlet through the eyes of Rosencranz and Gildenstern? Sounds promising! Telling the story of Oz through the eyes of the Wicked Witch? Could be interesting! Telling the story of Dr Jekyll (y'know? ...the exciting character!!) through an extremely uninteresting servant too timid to have a viewpoint? Um, no. No very much. No times a hundred. This device holds no potential.2) Malkovich - Characters in the movie are supposed to believe Malkovich is two people. But this guy can't be bothered to develop one role in a normal movie, let alone two characters here; horrible, horrible piece of casting! He gives the same contemptuous, bland, disinterested, passive-aggressive performance he's been overpaid for, for twenty years. He fails to modulate anything an actor has under his control, generating tedium on screen, and ennui in viewers.3) Familiarity - We know this story. If you haven't found a way to embroider it, you can't just prolong its only revelation (duality) for an hour and a half. Because it makes the characters seem severely dull-witted. No one has two identical-looking antagonists in their life who are never seen at the same time. Every moment is the same as the next.There's a belated spfx ending which is wildly out of place, and feels like the 25th attempt to save a movie. The combined talents of the three (Roberts, Malkovich & Frears) did not produce sparks, excitement or even a feeble puff of smoke.

Others have been looser with the story. Mary Reilly is based on a novel by Valerie Martin and tells the story from the perspective of a housemaid in Dr. Jekyll's household. It also tells the story as more of a dark romance than a horror movie, as Mary Reilly, the title character develops a strange romantic triangle with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and has simultaneous feelings of attraction and revulsion.It is an interesting concept and it makes a good story. But in my opinion, it wasn't executed well on screen. I have liked Julia Roberts in some of her performances, but she just wasn't convincing in this one at all. And John Malkovich wasn't menacing or evil enough as Mr. Hyde. Perhaps I shouldn't have expected the same physical unattractiveness for Mr. Hyde as in other versions of the story, since Mary Reilly clearly found something to attract her, but I didn't see much difference between the good doctor and the evil beast. I also didn't find the dialog in the film to be very inspiring. The settings were okay, but nothing terribly special.I think it is fair to say that I was disappointed with this film and that I didn't think it was very good, though it was far from the worst film I've ever seen.

Surprising considering it's by Stephen Frears, who rarely directs a film that is less than excellent. And it start John Malkovich, one of the finest character actors today. So how could it go wrong? Start by giving Julia Roberts the lead role, that's guaranteed to lower the quality of the film by about 60%. Then you can give her an Irish accent, that'll be good for another 30%...and what you have left isn't worth the film it's printed on. Julia Roberts, who's bad enough when she speaks in her own American lilt, does the Irish accent about as well as Richard Gere in The Jackal and Brad Pitt in The Devil's Own. That is to say, she sounds about as Irish as Stephen Rea sounds Japanese. Her accent slips repeatedly (Irish voices don't 'twang') and the few moments when she *almost* sounds Irish, the other Irish accents, which are *real*, make her sound about as convincing as she acts not very. When will Hollywood learn and give Irish and Scottish and English roles to actors from their own bloody countries??? Take Bronagh Gallagher, a highly underrated actress (whose been in The Commitments and Pulp Fiction among others...) who could easily have done this role justice, but instead is thrown into the background in a bit part.And that's just the beginning. Trying to take a schlock penny-horror story, a classic in many ways but not to be mistaken with quality literature, and infuse it with intellect and soul-searching that weren't meant to be there. is ridiculous. This movie fails, as the book did before it, precisely because the story was not meant to be that kind of story; it was meant to be a suspenseful, shocking and off the wall horror novel, it wasn't about karma or the hardships of life or romance etc. etc. etc. And if they were going to re-write the story from a servant's perspective, they should not have dared to 'create' any part of the story itself, and they should not have added portions that had no bearing on the story. Mary Reilly, who barely existed in the original novel, had no bearing on the story, little bearing in Jeckyll's life. And where were Lanyon and Utterson?? Two integral parts of the story, and not even a glance? And a maid such as Reilly, especially with her background, would not be literate, nor so impertinent; suspension of disbelief only goes so far. And the romance at the end?? Give me a break!! If ever there was a story that needed to stay away from the Hollywood-ization, this is one!! That and the end of the book has the staff (Mary included) breaking down the door to discover his body...Most of all, where is the story? The good versus evil, the trials of Jeckyll's conscience and life? The whole 'story behind the story' that made it as interesting as it was, that propelled it to near-intellect? Not a hint of it. And Glenn Close's character, who for some odd reason resembled Cruella a little too closely (pardon the pun;) took up *way* too much time and space.Finally, as brilliant as John Malkovich is (and he played the two halves distinctly) wasn't too convincing as either character. Could have been the script, or the directing, or it could have been him, but Jeckyll seemed to shriveled, too anemic. And Hyde was crude and obnoxious, and vicious and strong, but he lacked two important elements the intellect (which was referred to by Poole but never actually shown very clearly), he was supposed to be a *very* intellectual man, which was part of the reason he was so horrific; and the presence he was supposed to be so eerie, as if something was wrong with him...so that even being in his presence was enough to make one frightened or uneasy, and his eyes were supposed to be piercing and contain pure evil...I'd have like to have seen a 60s era Christopher Lee in this role instead. Or, physically at least, Vincent D'Onofrio (if he could act he'd be perfect...)...*he* has those eyes (watch Full Metal Jacket and you'll understand).Overall This film was trash. Much too long and dreary, *way* off-key...it lacked most of what made the original Stevenson novel so good. The acting...someone lock Julia Roberts away PLEASE!!

However, the calmness of the household is broken when Jekyll starts to stay out all night, he then says he will be collaborating with an assistant named Mr. Edward Hyde (John Malkovich) on his experiments & he should be treated as they treat him. Reilly meets Mr. Hyde who turns out to be a bit of a bad lad, meanwhile she has secret affections for her master Dr. Jekyll & soon realises they are both one & the same person...Directed by Stephen Frears I will openly admit right here & now that Mary Reilly bored me stiff, I honestly wanted to switch it off & go to sleep but in the fairness of this comment I decided to endure the final 40 minutes. The script by Christopher Hampton was based on the novel of the same name by Valerie Martin which itself obviously took inspiration from the Robert Louis Stevenson novel The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, who was it exactly that thought telling the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde from the perspective of his housemaid was a good idea? No offence but it sounds lame just thinking about it & sure enough the finished film is total crap that I personally found ways to hate it on many levels. From the absolute tedium of it all to the snails pace, to the awful romance between the main character's & the slushy sentimental drama to the fact it's one of the most boring films I've seen. I didn't like anyone in it, I didn't like the way the makers have taken a decent horror themed story & turned it into some horrible tedious romance & the lack of any horror or scares just sinks it without trace as far as I'm concerned. By the way did I mention it was boring?Director Frears does alright, to give the film credit where it deserves it the production design & look of it are fabulous. This would give any period Hammer Horror flick a good run for it's money, then again I suppose you can stage a film like this when you have nearly 50 million dollars as your budget. Apparently Tim Burton was set to direct this but decided to make Ed Wood (1994) instead, he might have actually injected some horror & mystery into the plot while still retaining the Gothic romance just like he did with his excellent Sleepy Hollow (1999). There's no real horror or scares in Mary Reilly, it has a nice fog enshrouded look but little else. Animal lovers beware, there are shots of eels being killed & skinned, being the old romantic that he is Mr. Hyde takes Mary to a slaughter house & again there are various animal carcasses strung up being skinned & gutted along with various organs in buckets & strewn across the floor. A man is also killed with the end of his walking cane in the films most violent scene.I am amazed this had a budget of near $50,000,000, it doesn't look like it although it's undeniably well staged & made. According to the IMDb Roberts got paid $10,000,000 for this, well she's terrible in it & her accent is awful. Shot on location in London, Scotland & in Pinewood studios. Generally speaking though there's a great cast here including Malkovich, George Cole, Kathy Staff, Michael Gombon & Glenn Close as the owner of a London whore house. At the 1997 Razzie Awards Mary Reilly was nominated for two, Julia Roberts as worst actress which she should have won & Stephen Frears as worst director which considering the film looks alright is maybe a bit harsh.Mary Reilly is in my opinion a terrible film & it's as simple & straight forward as that, when I watch a film I want to be entertained & not bored out of my skull & that's just the way it is. Thank god I saw it on cable TV & didn't spend any of my hard earned money on it. Mary Reilly sucks & she should have stuck to being a lowly servant girl.

Too bad somebody didn't tell him that he's supposed to be an Engish creep, because he maintains his American accent throughout. Now and then he seems to remember that the film is set in London and makes a pathetic attempt at an accent that sounds more US upper class than British. Ditto for Julia Roberts American accent throughout, although she occasionally remembers that she's supposed to be Irish and takes a stab at an Irish lilt. Maybe the production was too broke to hire diction coaches? Who knows? The misplaced accents might be overlooked if it were an interesting film. However, it creeps along at a snails pace and is relentlessly dreary to boot. Come to think of it, maybe this was atmospherics, the result of an attempt to create a somber mood consistent with the subject matter. If so, it was a success in spades, although it stretched credibility as far as it could go. Doesn't the sun ever shine in London? Are people always shivering when they step outside? The Jekyll-Hyde story has been filmed many times. It is always a challenge to decide how to make up the lead actor for the Mr. Hyde scenes. In this film, they keep it simple John Malkovich plays Jekyll with salt and pepper hair and a Van Dyke; when he plays Hyde, his hair has a henna tint and he is clean shaven. This got me to thinking what are we to assume that the character does when he goes from Hyde to Jekyll? Put on false whiskers, maybe? Stop to take the henna out of his hair? Again, who knows?

The film begins with a lovely metaphor -- Mary's warm hands bringing a stunned eel back to life (an eel that is then mercilessly chopped up and served for breakfast), and this metaphor is a wonderful analogy for Mary's effect on the doomed Dr. Jekyll.  She brings him back to life, but only after a terrible decision has already been made. It's too late.I especially loved several aspects to this film -- not just the performances, but the literate and subtle script by Hampton, that really gives a sense of the war for good and evil within all the lead characters -- especially illuminating both sides of the coin that is Mary herself (because the film has no easy answers), and that she truly fears and loves equally -- as does Dr. Jekyll himself.  The film shows compassion toward both lead characters as the subtle victims of early abuse -- but where Jekyll seeks to become the knife as well as the blade, Mary's situation is both simpler and more complex.  She doesn't seek retribution but instead finds a kind of fascination in herself with the undeniably attractive Hyde, who apologizes to no one, who neatly sidesteps the Victorian niceties of the times.  She may want to screw Hyde, but she loves Jekyll. In some ways, it's the perfect match -- even if it is an impossible threesome.The performances are lovely -- Roberts' accent is uneven (she did a much more authentic brogue in Michael Collins), but she is really striking visually, has never been more beautiful, and makes some very brave choices as an actress nonetheless, so the accent inconsistencies didn't bother me too much. Malkovich is wonderful and equally subtle (even if Hyde does seem to simply be channeling his Vicomte from Dangerous Liaisons).  The script by Hampton is literate and sometimes troubling (there are no easy Freudian answers here), and the direction is gorgeous, as is the cinematography -- Roberts and Malkovich seem to emerge as pale haunted visages in the darkness.Overall, flaws and all, I'd recommend this film as worth a second look.

The way she kept her eyes shifting and the way she always turned her gaze downwards was wonderful.  I heard this movie didn't do so well at the box office, and I can see why.

One wouldn't think this downbeat material suitable for mega-watt star Roberts, but her lead performance is fragile, low-keyed and admirable; her Irish accent quavers, and in her quest to become this meek woman she loses her innate sweetness, yet it's still respectable work. Malkovich, on the other hand, is terribly one-note, and the film waits too long to spring surprises on us (they're all in the final act).

It's based on one of those derivative novels - this time Stevenson's classic novella Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde as seen by his parlourmaid(!) the eponymous Mary Reilly. Possibly she is superwoman in disguise because she seems to run an enormous Edinburgh house more or less single-handed (the other household staff, all four of them, don't appear do anything very useful about the place). This includes cleaning, washing-up, gardening (converting the stone-flagged yard of an Edinburgh town house?!) while running all over Edinburgh on errands for Dr Jekyll for whom she nurses an ill-concealed passion. The dialogue is dreadful; banality separated by long meaningless pauses to spin this tosh out to what seems an interminable length.

What both pieces manage to do, while inserting the Roberts character, is keep true to the feel and events of the original Stevenson novel. In fact, it manages to do this better than any adaptation on film or stage. Everything from event, to described layout for Jekyll's home and laboratory, to the various locations throughout London are presented in vivid detail on screen. That is an amazing thing for any film adaptation to do.Roberts gets points for stepping into the role of Mary Reilly, thereby making this film the only movie in which Julia Roberts doesn't play Julia Roberts. It's definitely unusual to see her as a character so introverted, in a position where, while she sees almost everything going on, she must deal with her own disbelief and her station, which demands she not say or do anything about it.This was actually my first Malkovich film, and that is really a credit to him. His versatile portrayal of Jekyll and Hyde leaves him both endearing and terrifying at the same time.Glenn Close is also a treat as Ms. Farraday.Definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of the original Stevenson novel.

In the original story the Jekyll household indeed has a maid called Mary Reilly whom has some importance to Dr. Jekyll and as such the plot is good and can give a different point of view to the story. But the adaptation does have its holes or should we say omissions, there's no way that the household won't get some gossip about the actions of Mr. Edward Hyde, even if they don't at first connect the dots, and I don't believe or have seen in other adaptations of the story that Mr. Hyde is in any way trying to hide his misdoings. Dr. Jekyll does look tired and exhausted, as he should, but he doesn't seem to be effected much by the doings of Mr. Hyde, now at first he isn't even aware of Mr. Hyde's nightly escapades but since the good doctor indeed is a very smart man he'll soon figure out that the guilty culprit is his own alter-ego. He does try to stop Mr. Hyde but there just don't seem to be much willpower behind. Mary herself is well enough carried over it seems, there at least seems to be some genuine concern in the character. Now it has to be said that I haven't read the novel, but with the knowledge I have of the basic story, I'll have to say that the adaptation is well enough but I do find it lacking, we lack something of the grisly escapades of Mr. Hyde and the research conducted by Dr. Jekyll, whichever way we put it, Mary must at least have heard some rumors and seen some research one way or the other. In fact this is part where this plot and adaptation falls slightly apart, we don't get that feeling of contempt or chock over what Mr Hyde is doing because we don't get to see anything until the very last moment and then more in flashback than real-time. Otherwise in fits well enough into the age in which it's placed (Victorian) but it's evident that this is an American movie set in Victorian England. The story is enjoyable enough but lacks the grisly business as described above.Actors The actors do an okay performance but this won't win any of them an award for good acting, there doesn't seem to be much emotion towards what the Hyde character does, either they haven't got any more clue than somebody who doesn't know the setup or the writers/directors haven't been able to convey this to the actors. Julie Roberts does portray Mary Reilly good enough but doesn't have the right accent; it's easy to hear that she's an American because she doesn't have that London way of speaking. Otherwise there isn't much to fault her in that doesn't go for all involved actors. Michael Gambon does a very good portray of Mary's Father, a very abusive one at that, but this is in line with the age and the way that life was at the time in the poor quarters. We don't see him that much but what we see of him is well within his character, heck if you didn't know you wouldn't even notice that it's him (always a good sign), so he's probably the actor with the best performance in this movie. John Malkovich does a good job as Mr. Edward Hyde, but his portrayal of Dr. Henry Jekyll is lacking in warmth or in the caring that the character originally has for his fellow people. He is usually good at these semi-dark character portrayals but his aura somehow lacks that quality that is needed for a character of Dr. Jekyll's type. Glenn Close is also hard to place, as I don't know that much of her character, Mrs. Farraday. The character seems like one that Dr. Jekyll wouldn't be friends with, she has a very gruff tone and appears to be one that won't have any one push her around and yet she'll do anything for Dr. Jekyll, but as I said I don't have enough knowledge of the character. Her performance also seems to be missing something that I can't quite place, but I'll take a chance that it's the same that the others lacks.Effects The clothes and sets (such as the operating theater) looks to be of the right time period as does the props, the only thing that I have any gripes about is Mary's noose, now I can't remember the description of her that I have heard but that noose looks wrong, it's clearly a fake noose and looks out of place on Julia Roberts.Overall The overall feeling I'm left is that this movie is a good enough time waster when shown on TV; it's not one that I would pay to see in a theater. I will probably buy it on DVD at some point but only because of the alternative view of the Jekyll/Hyde story. I would give this a 6 on a scale from 1-10 due to the Jekyll/Hyde factor.

L. Stevenson, introducing however here a new element aimed perhaps at rendering it more human. This element is personified by Julia Robert's role as Mary Reilly a house-maid in Doctor Jekyll's domestic staff. She is now the main character in the story something that Stevenson never had in mind. But this beautiful and sensitive actress does a great job by playing a role of a maid feeling a hardly concealed attraction by her mysterious master and by his mysterious behaviour itself. It's a pity that Frears didn't want (or wasn't able to) to explore more deeply this relationship between master (in his two personalities) and servant instead of following more or less faithfully the plot conceived by Stevenson with its dichotomy between Good and Evil living in the same person and the general atmosphere of thrilling horror in which the story develops itself. That deepening would have brought a new spiritual dimension to the story and would have enriched even the above mentioned dichotomy. This was however only barely suggested and sketched. Nevertheless it's still this relationship that gives the movie most of its value. Julia Roberts is exceptional indeed. As to the rest images and sceneries are fairly well filmed and the players'acting is also good. "},{"Title":"Horrifying and accomplishes what R.L.

John Malkovich as Jekyll and Hyde was perfect casting. Jekyll is a doctor whom everyone around him loves, and he creates a serum that can bring out the real him, the side that nobody else can see. Having the story told through the eyes of a housemaid who actually sees the transformation, and has to live with both characters is far more effective than having a lawyer who only hears stories about what happens from other people tell the story.I was surprised that Julia Roberts was able to play a character of this depth so well.

The story is told from the point of view of the title character, Dr. Jekyll's housemaid, Mary Reilly, played by Julia Roberts. Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde are terrifyingly portrayed by John Malkovich. His transformation between the two characters is stunning. He actually looks like a different man, but only his clothes and hair color have changed. And although Julia Roberts' accent leaves much to be desired (that unmistakable twang somehow works its' way through), her portrayal of the character is actually rather brilliant. She perfectly shows us a woman who is at once surrounded by fear, but also touchingly courageous.This movie makes a careful examination of the rigid Victorian mores that inspired Stevenson's classic, and of the lengths the human heart will go to escape them.

Mary Reilly is talking about the dark side of man, so is Mallick, only in his case the context is war.

The photography, design and dialogue are simply first-class, and Stephen Frears' direction is, as usual, nothing less than inspired.In short, this film should be savoured, absorbed, and watched quietly and carefully.

He does this in a subtle, slow and dark style. That all combined makes Mary Reilly an uneasy and unpleasant movie to watch that's all style over substance. The movie lacks scares, tension, mystery and an overall good pace.It's hard to say what is the biggest problem and failure of the movie, since there are so many little things present in this movie, which all combined makes this movie a failed attempt. One of them is the story itself. It not only is told slow and perhaps even boring, it also features lots of unneeded sequences with uninteresting characters involved. Another major problem I had with this movie was its style. This movie is darker than dark. I don't know, for some reason a movie that is entirely dark just doesn't ever work out as a scary or mysterious one. Its dark style rather makes this movie an uneasy one to watch. Granted that the cinematography is good and so are the sets and costumes but this is mostly ruined and pushed to the back by the overly dark and depressing atmosphere of the movie. Everything also isn't told in the most arousing pace, which causes this movie at times to be a drag and far from interesting one.Normally Julia Roberts obviously is one fine actress but not in this movie. She feels out of place and basically all she does in this movie is look scared with her big eyes. Not her finest moment. I also expected more from John Malkovich. I mean, he seems like the perfect guy to portray the evil and scary Mr. Hyde but he gets very little interesting to do in this movie. Lots is implied in this movie but very little is actually shown on screen. The movie also features Michael Gambon, Glenn Close, Michael Sheen and Ciarán Hinds in an early role. They are fine but they basically add very little to the story in their little roles, which seems to have been written just for them, so they could be in this movie. I also don't like how they changed the Mr. Poole the Butler character. Poole is a loyal, friendly, hard working man but in this movie he is more portrayed as a villainous tough boss, who you don't want to mess with.Also perhaps the most laughable and unbelievable element of the movie is that the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde character look obviously alike. Both are of course played by John Malkovich but no make-up is applied and he doesn't alter his voice. Some voice, same hands, same face, same eyes but yet nobody recognizes Mr. Hyde as Dr. Jekyll. Basically only difference between the two characters is that Mr. Hyde has long hair and Dr. Jekyll is unshaven. Also their personalities are actually much alike. I really didn't see so much difference between the 'good' Dr. Jekyll and the 'evil' Mr. Hyde.The ending, although it's good looking and effective, is a letdown that doesn't feel like a fitting ending at all.This movie is definitely not an easy one to watch. If you're not familiar at all with the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde story, written by Robert Louis Stevenson, than this movie is completely unwatchable and not understandable to watch for you, as well as an even bigger bore than it already is at certain moments.A failure but a beautiful one, that still is not worth seeing.4/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Julia Is Prepared For Anything","Date":"28 March 2006","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Romance","Review":" The Film was Good because Julia can act in any Genare of film her performance was very good, put her Irish accent was disguised.
