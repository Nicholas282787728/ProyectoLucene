It's under her roof that I heard some of my favorite dialogue in the movies.I am not a violent person, but  Old man . . . you give those dogs another piece of my meat and I'll kick ya til ya dead! has got to be on my top ten list of memorable quotes.I like the conversations around this family's kitchen table maybe because growing up, meals in my house were pretty silent even though there were seven of us.  Funny that it took an Irish screenwriter to capture the Italian cadences.  These people aren't caricatures of Italians or any other ethnicity, they are just a vocal family.In another time, with just a few changes in the script, this story could have been high operatic drama.  But it's not.  It's a romantic comedy not a tragedy - even though it contains elements of tragedy - death under a bus, a lost limb, betrayal of marriage vows, and misinterpretations and misunderstandings.But these characters TALK about what's on their minds. You want to know where the Met is located? You ask your hairdresser.  You think your husband is flirting with another woman? You tell him that while you're both working behind the wine counter - in front of a customer.  You're mad at your brother, you want to know why men need more than one woman, you want your son to pay for the wedding of his only daughter?  If you really want to know, if you really want results or answers,  you speak up!Besides movies based on Agatha Christie novels, it is rare that a story ends with bringing the entire cast together more satisfyingly than Moonstruck. The morning-after-the-opera scene in Rose Castorini's  sunny kitchen with all the characters present is one that I can watch again and again. You've got a love-bite on yer neck - your life's goin down the toilet! I want you to stop seeing her  Who are we waiting for?  Johnny Cammarari You're a part of the family!No matter what sort of table you grew up around, rent or buy this movie.And remember, No matter what you're gonna do you gonna die, just like everybody else!

She is engaged to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello), a bland man, more out of a resigned duty than actual love. Before their wedding Johnny takes a trip out to visit his mother who is sick and leaves Loretta the function of playing the olive leaf with his brother Ronny by notifying him of their impending wedding. Ronny (Nicholas Cage) hasn't forgiven Johnny for being the cause of his accident which caused him the loss of his hand (and subsequently, his then-bride-to-be), but he does fall for Loretta, and hard. After a heated affair Loretta out of respect for Johnny tries to avoid Ronny, but his dark looks and overpowering masculinity win her over. Meanwhile, Loretta's mother Rose Castorini (Olympia Dukakis) is not only suspecting her husband Cosmo (Vincent Gardenia) is seeing another woman, but is also herself the subject of admiration from a college professor and wonders why do men chase women. Things get complicated when Johnny returns from Sicily to tell Loretta they can't be married.The setup is pure sitcom, but the story, written by John Patrick Shanley with a deep understanding for Italian-Americans living in New York, is genuine he gets the idiosyncrasies of these people and their day-to-day foibles and quirks, and all of the characters have a deep romanticism that comes through in key moments throughout the story. Loretta, a character hardened by the loss of her husband and knowing her chances of happiness are slim, slowly emerges as a woman who is so swept by the sudden recognition of love she becomes the heroine of La Boheme -- the one who acknowledges the love of the man with the wooden hand (in a clever gender reversal), and Cher inhabits the role and makes it hers and in her own style subtly trades her frumpiness to a deep, dark beauty. Ronny is pure fire and Nicholas Cage exudes masculine power as if he were channeling Marlon Brando. The Castorini's and the Cappomaggi's, counterbalancing the central couple, both express their love for each other in two very crucial moments the latter couple, on the night of the full moon when Loretta and Ronny consummate their affair -- a rare scene depicting love and intimacy among the elderly --, and the former at a tense moment over breakfast when Rose bluntly reveals, in touching words, that she wants Cosmo to stop seeing his mistress Mona (Anita Gillette).MOONSTRUCK is not only the romantic comedy and date movie of choice, but also a beautiful examination of love and passion among regular people. The ending is a tour de force of emotional impact, the family situation going beyond the momentary complications to cement it in tradition going back to the days of immigrants, and is one that elevates this movie from being just another feel-good movie to a classic. MOONSTRUCK deservedly got its Oscars for Best Writing, Actress, and Supporting Actress, and has proved to grow beyond its time.

It takes about 15 minutes for the picture's rhythm to kick in (there's an early sequence with the grandfather and his dogs at the cemetery that's a little rough, and a following scene with Cosmo and the elderly man at the gate that seems obtuse), but the patchwork of the plot is interwoven with nimble skill, and the movie's wobbly tone and kooky spirit are both infectious. ***1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Cher is great","Date":"10 February 2004","Score":"27 out of 31 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  'Moonstruck' is a love story.

He and Johnny haven't spoken each other in five years and Loretta wants to invite him to the wedding. Of course they fall instantly for each other.How this story and love stories of Loretta's parents and uncle and aunt develop is something you simply have to see for yourself. Every seen is a delight to watch, with Cher as the bright star in the middle of everything. She won and really deserved the Oscar that year.

Only a pretentious, humorless moron would not enjoy this wonderful film. This movie feels like a slice of warm apple pie topped with french vanilla ice cream! I think this is Cher's best work ever and her most believable performance. Cher has always been blessed with charisma, good looks, and an enviably thin figure. Whether you like her singing or not - who else sounds like Cher? Cher has definitely made her mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others have come and gone. She is one of the most unique artists out there. It's funny, because who would have thought of Cher as such a naturally gifted actress? She is heads above the so-called movie stars of today. Cher is a real actor on the same level as Debra Winger, Alfre Woodard, Holly Hunter, Angela Bassett and a few others, in that she never seems to be acting, she really becomes the character convincingly. She has more than earned the respect of her peers and of the movie-going public.Everything about Moonstruck is wonderful - the characters, the scenery, the dialog, the food. I never get tired of watching this movie.Every time single time I watch the scene where they are all sitting around the dinner table at Rose's house, I pause the remote to see exactly what delicious food Rose is serving. I saw the spaghetti, mushrooms (I think), but I can't make out whether they are eating ravioli, ziti? What is that main course? It looks wonderful and its driving me nuts! Everybody in that family was a hardworking individual and they respected and cared about one another. The grandfather wasn't pushed aside and tolerated, he was a vital part of the family and he was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom. He seemed to be a pretty healthy, independent old codger too.Loretta's mom wasn't just a housewife, she was the glue that held the family together and was a model example of what a wife, mother, and home manager should aspire to be. She was proud of the lifestyle she had chosen but she didn't let it define who she was. High powered businessmen aren't as comfortable in their skin as Rose Casterini was. Notice the saucy way she said I didn't have kids until after I was 37. It ain't over 'til its over. You got the sense that she had been the type of young woman who did exactly as she pleased and got her way without the other person realizing what had happened. She was charming, quick witted, and very smart. What a great mom! I didn't actually like Loretta right away because she seemed like a bit of a know--it-all who wasn't really as adventurous and as in control of herself as she wanted others to think. She could tell others about themselves and where they had gone wrong, but she really didn't apply common sense to her own life. She was going to marry a middle-aged mama's boy simply because she wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose to her life. She was more conventional than her own mom. She dressed and wore her hair like a matron at a house of detention and seemed humorless and bored, but underneath you sensed that she was vulnerable and lonely and had a lot of love to give the right man. She would probably end up making an awesome mom too.I could see in the future, a house full of Loretta and Ronnie's loud, screaming happy kids and Rose and Cosmo enjoying every minute of it.

It is virtually flawless! The writing, acting, production design, humor and pathos are all wonderful! Even the music -- from Dean Martin to La Boheme -- is captivating and delightful!Every character is peculiarly delightful and memorable, from the leads played by Cher and Nicolas Cage, to the many supporting roles -- Olympia Dukakis , Vincent Gardenia, John Mahoney, Danny Aiello -- even grandpa with his dog pack! Each of these performers, plus Norman Jewison as Director, performs above their normal quality in this ensemble work. For several of the actors, this was an early major exposure in film, so the casting is also exceptional -- and we have many current acting powerhouses whose careers were altered by their effectiveness in this film.I've seen this film several times all the way through -- which can sometimes deflate the impact of a film substantially. More tellingly, I realized some years ago that whenever I channel-surfed my way into a scene from this film -- any scene -- the scene was compelling and beautifully crafted. There are so many stunning and memorable scenes the original meeting between the Cher and Nicolas Cage characters, where Cage tells his tale of woe; Vincent Gardenia discovered with his paramour at the opera, amidst the splendor generated by his gold-mine plumbing business; Olympia Dukakis scolding John Mahoney for philandering with his student in the classic line about liaisons with co-workers Don't sh-t where you eat!; Danny Aiello at his dying mother's bedside; Nicolas Cage taking Cher as the rapture of an aria soars in the background! There are of course many great romantic comedies, among them Sabrina (both versions, but especially the Audrey Hepburn/Humphrey Bogart/William Holden original); When Harry Met Sally; The Apartment.None quite equals Moonstruck!

Nick Cage plays an over-the-top, brooding romantic to Danny Aiello's safe, stodgy, stingy older brother. Dukakis is brilliant as the sad and wise mother and I can't stand Vincent Gardenia but even his role is irreplaceable. The movie is beautifully filmed and so full of fun it overflows. Each scene is perfect. The characters intertwine and if you don't like the love scene between the Cappomaggis you aren't human. Another poster asked what the purpose of the lost deposit bag is. It's the reason the Cappomaggis come to the house early in the morning. It's a foil to get all the family in one place. I have no idea what Italians in NY are like. Frankly, I have no idea what NY is like. But this film makes me smell the streets and the bread shop and the old home. All the characters move comfortably in the environment and they all come together at just the right time. It's about la luna, l'amore, and la famiglia. This film may never be considered an all-time great piece of work, but based upon the horrible romantic comedies coming out today, making a good one is pretty difficult and this is an excellent romantic comedy.

Although it's comic moments aim lower than the rest of it, the movie has a wonderful specificity (Italians in Brooklyn) that isn't used to shortchange the characters or the viewers. (i.e. Mobsters never appear in acomplication. It never becomes grotesque like My Big Fat Greek Wedding) The secondary story lines are economically told with short scenes that allow a break from the major thread. These are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary movies where their immediate value cannot be impressed upon producers and bigwigs. I miss these scenes. It also beautifully involves older characters. The movie takes it's own slight, quiet path to a conclusion. There isn't a poorly written scene included anywhere to make some executives sphincter relax.

Just being around my loved ones gave me the feeling of comfort.When I get very melancholy and miss them, especially around the holidays, I put in MOONSTRUCK and feel that a part of my family is with me. The kitchen scene when Loretta is feeding Ronnie, the  not so well donesteak, so it can feed his blood, is hilarious. Those words would have come out of any of my female relatives.Ronnie's white kitchen with the white fixtures and white tile is a copycat of my aunt Elvira's spotless kitchen.When Mrs. Casterini is fixing the breakfast of fried eggs in the Italian bread blankets for Loretta and herself, I was in my grandmother's kitchen.I get such comfort when the movie scenes are in the Casterini kitchen, dining room and parlor.

Then Again, So Does Everybody Else!!","Date":"8 March 2010","Score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" The bittersweet twist to this movie contains a wonderful element of romanticism that evokes an impetuous passion! These characteristics of idealistic imagery which Moonstruck possesses, spur on an end result of a resounding thumbs up verdict by virtually every prominent critic in Hollywood. Let me describe the circumstances to this film, simply put, they are yesteryear. Moonstruck is a cohesive film which sparks the naivety of an old Italian neighborhood in New York City. New York City has always been one big melting pot that is galvanized by many bicker-some mannerisms which are indicative of typical New Yorkers, this includes a lot of Italian Americans living in New York as well! The mid and late eighties brought on an abrupt conclusion to many strong associations with various cultural stereotypes. Ethnicity polarization was a firmly embedded scourge in American history that was far more prevalent several generations before this movie was made. These generalizing proclivities still exist today, however, they are more mollified and less identifiable! For this Italian family of a bygone era, confusion, indecisiveness, agitation, and yes, of course, love, all have the comical camaraderie of an utterly human understanding to them! The kindred spirits with everyone in Moonstruck seems to be that of comprehending individual frailties. One might wonder about Cher playing the lead role, as she is more known as an entertainer than a big box office first billing star in a movie. In Moonstruck, however, I think she was incredibly well suited to her role, and came off as thoroughly believable in a relatively unbelievable situation. All of the characters in Moonstruck are very rough around the edges, really tough, and not afraid to have a formidable duel with adversity. The most hilarious aspect to their lives is imperfection, and they are thoroughly aware of the fact that weathering the storm definitely serves a constructive purpose! I thought the acting in this movie was sensational. All relationships in this movie garner an auspicious potential to vividly illuminate because everybody knows how everybody else's basic nature is really like!! For this family, nothing is glamorous, nothing is pretentiously romantic, and nothing is overly emotional (just moderately so). The fact is, this entire family is plainly and perpetually afflicted and overcome by an extremely zealous and candid cupid in all of their lives. Taking moon beams literally can indeed have a pleasantly enervating impact on one's resolve, masqueraded mystique, and resistance to the proverbial am ore'. Thus signifying everything!! The homey and mercurial tenet in this film is basically one of ; Be honest, get angry; Be honest, get confrontational; Be honest, get distorted and emphatic; Most importantly; Be honest, and fall in love!! This is Cher's best performance ever as an actress!! Nicholas Cage, Danny Aiello, and Olympia Dukakis, were wonderfully flawed in Moonstruck Such performances by these three were perfectly appropriate for the kinetic energy of the characters in this movie! Director, Norman Jewison (Famous for Cincinnati Kid, Thomas Crowne Affair, and most famous for In The Heat Of The Night which won the academy award for best picture in 1967) depicts many keen and humanistic instincts in the process of purveying the deliberate incongruity to this film! I am Italian American in descent, (Partially anyways) Cher is not Italian, and, for that matter, neither is the writer nor the director! I guess since non-Italians like eating our food, they may as well use our culture to make a fabulous film too! It is refreshing to know that a film can be marvelous and have an incredibly happy ending!! For those of you who didn't like this movie, I just have one thing to say Snap Out Of It!! This movie Moonstruck is totally happy go lucky!! Totally eighties!! and Totally five stars!! See it!!

Okay, that's no shock, because most films are shot that way, but the image on the Moonstruck DVD is, in fact, the full un-matted image that was shot for the theaters.Tough to believe, but true. So, when people complain about a non-widescreen version they're in fact raising a non-issue. If anything the home viewer is seeing more of the image than what was originally shown. Specifically there's more room above and below the actors. In a sense you're seeing nearly the full frame of the picture.Myself, I can think of only one other film where this was done (though I'm sure there're ample examples of other such films), and that film was Boorman's Excalibur. The original VHS release of Excalibur is a typical 1.331 image, though, if you look carefully at that version of the film, you see slightly more image than in the widescreen presentation; specifically room above the actors' heads, and below their feet.The reasons are usually sound related. Often on location most of the sound is unusable, though it's recorded and kept as a reference track. Hence there's no real reason to stick the mic out over the actors to clearly pick up what they're saying. As long as their duologue is recorded, along with room tone or other ambient sound, the sound that will be used in the final version of the film can be added later. Hence more of the film frame can be used, because there's no worry about a boom mic creeping downwards into frame since it's off to the side of the camera.I don't know that this is what was done for Moonstruck, but it seems credible enough to me as I've seen this done before.But this all my opinion. I don't really know for certain, though I'd put good money on my educated guess.So to all you folks dying for a widescreen edition, relax You've already got it -) "},{"Title":"The complicated chaos of love in the face of mortality.","Date":"29 March 2015","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" There's something endearing about movies about love that try their hardest to be as unromantic as possible. First the clunkiest proposal you can imagine, nestled in a backdrop of rocky marriages, then the bride-to-be falls in love with the fiancé's brother and the film follows that thread. Sexually charged infidelity as the main plot in a film about love. Fortunately, John Patrick Shanley's tight witty script is what holds it together and it offers profound insight into love in the face of mortality. Love is complicated and Moonstruck encapsulates that chaos. It's a film drenched in its Italian American culture, paired with its operatic score, and that needs an acquired taste. I struggled to feel close to any of the characters, though I empathised with Cher and Nicolas Cage, an unexpected highlight in his most vibrant scenes. I wasn't as impressed with Oscar winners Cher and Olympia Dukakis as I hoped, they're both subdued and a little too much is lost in what they hold back.

Widowed by a freak bus accident, she wiles away the shank of her thirties as a self-employed accountant who lives with her aging family under the skyscrapers of the Big Apple. Just as she readies herself for a loveless marriage with the sweet-but-simple Johnny Cammarini (Danny Aiello), love strikes in the form of Johnny's bitter brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage). Can Loretta do the right thing, even if she doesn't quite know what that is?Moonstruck is a comedy that works in serious themes, like death, infidelity, faith, and hopelessness. Writer John Patrick Shanley operates with a deft hand and an ear for how people say what they really mean even when they try to say something else, like when Loretta's cheating father Cosmo (Vincent Gardinia, along with Cage one of the authentic Italian-American cast members) warns her against marriage because, well, he's cheap and doesn't want to pay for it.Seeing her ring from Johnny is just a pinky ring (Johnny wasn't prepared when he popped the question), Pop complains when she tells him it's temporary Everything is temporary! That don't excuse nothing!Cher won an Oscar for her performance, which wasn't maybe the best of all performances that year but carries the film ably. I'm not a Cher fan myself, but it's hard not to admire the way she plays Loretta against expectations. She's quiet and subtle when you expect big and loud. Even late in the film, when she undergoes her expected transformation into a glamour queen, she doesn't go all diva about it.You look beautiful, Ronny tells her. Your hair.Yeah, I had it done, she says with a shrug.Cage is the other over-the-top actor here, but he succeeds with that by playing his part more for laughs. He blames Johnny for the loss of his hand and his fiancé, not that it's fair of him and he knows it. I ain't no freakin' monument to justice, he exclaims.Cage's best work in the movie comes at the end, when he's not talking so much as listening in the background while the other characters have their big confessional moments at the breakfast table. That concluding scene is a showcase of fine comic acting and writing, which director Norman Jewison (another guy who liked to go big in other productions) plays very lightly and well, working the silences as much as the speeches to wry effect.Even the secondary performers, like Feodor Chaliapin as Cosmo's confused father, and Julie Bovasso and Louis Guss as Loretta's aunt and uncle, make their marks. This is a film about family that celebrates all its members.I don't quite buy a central premise of the film, that a man cheats on his wife because he's afraid of death, and feel some of the secondary scenes take up too much time, but there's a simple joy even in those scenes which sticks. Olympia Dukakis, the other Oscar-winner in the cast, has a great scene with Aiello which justifies his character's somewhat superfluous presence.To be in love is to die a little, but dying seems like a small price to pay for the pleasure of love. Such is the simple magical lesson on offer in Moonstruck.

At first, I was wondering if this was going to be just another sappy romantic movie but then I had some of the biggest laughs plus being mesmerized by the La Boheme score that was playing (Tebaldi/Bergonzi/Bastianini/Serafin on London DECCA. I left the theater that night hearing the La Boheme score swelling in my head! It was because of Moonstruck that I fell in love with Boheme and Opera itself and eventually decided to sing opera myself. Cher truly gave the performance of her life as Loretta Castorini. She really showed me a new dimension of not only her acting craft but also her personality. I don't think she has since given such a fine, funny and truly endearing performance. I love how she initially hides behind a no-nonsense rock of strength persona only to slowly have that unravel to show the audience a vulnerable woman who just wants to love and be loved. Olympia and Vincent were both superb as Loretta's parents. Nick Cage shows us a preview of his acting chops and how he worked hard to make success happen for himself without relying on his family's popular name Coppola to become famous!Julie Bovasso and Louis Guss were wonderful as Loretta's aunt and uncle. Feodor was brilliant as Loretta's grandfather and of course there's Danny Aiello as Johnny, Loretta's safe but boring fiancée. His character came close to home for me. It was also funny to see Peggy Hitler the mean cookie lady who beat up Ray Romano in an Everybody Loves Raymond episode AKA Amy Aquino playing one of the hair dressers in the beauty salon in a tiny part and several others.Moonstruck truly has many of the elements of a Puccini opera romance, comedy, and tragedy to some degree. This was New York City at its finest...at a time when I remember her to not be without problems but still has a certain charm and inviting allure despite her difficulties which has since been lost primarily after 9/11.(Haunting to watch scenes of the World Trade Center from Brooklyn) I personally am so glad this movie was made when it was and with the cast which was chosen.

When I worked in sales, I would stick in a Moonstruck reference when trying to convince someone to buy the step up, saying This is pretty good, unless something goes wrong. And something ALWAYS goes wrong. When cooking in our house, the request for someone to hand the cook the butcher knife is always, CHRISSY, BRING ME THE BIG KNIFE! (and there's no one named Chrissy in my family). If anyone says the word temporary someone will inevitably say, EVERYTHING IS TEMPORARY! Yes, we've seen Moonstruck a lot! Awesome movie. Great acting, great cast, likable characters...and it's not even a movie that needed to have a twisted storyline or absolute angst. It's one of those rare movies that really doesn't have much in the way of weaknesses. It's a simple slice of life film about two Italian families in Brooklyn. Simple as that. With the lovably passionate, eccentric personalities that come from such a culture as New York Italian, there's little need to insert jokes into this movie. The reality of the almost poetic communication among the family members is funny (at times hilarious!) enough. Plus, anyone who is passionate about Italian food like I am gets the urge the take a day trip to Little Italy to pick up a good loaf of bread every time they see the bread Ronny takes out of his bakery's old coal-fired brick oven! Every character is believable and likable, flaws and all. Loretta is a superstitious, but smart and level-headed widow who, in a rare loss of self-control, makes a passionate decision that causes a riotous chain of events within her family. Cosmo, Loretta's father, is a successful plumber who, now in his mid to late 60s, has begun to feel he has done nothing with his life and fears death. He turns to extramarital affairs in order to fill gaps he feels are in his life. Rose, the cynical, dry-witted wife of Cosmo and mother of Loretta, remains supportive and loving of her husband and daughter despite their moral failings. There's Johnny, Loretta's soft-spoken fiancé, is still controlled emotionally by his mother, who lives in Sicily. Ronny, Johnny's estranged brother, is an impulsive and tortured man who developed a vendetta against happiness ever since he lost his hand in a bread slicer (causing his then-fiancé, who did not want to be with a crippled man, to leave him). That is, until he meets Loretta. There's Raymond, Rose's brother, and his wife, Rita, who are still madly in love even after being married for many, many years. And there's the Old Man, Cosmo's immigrant father who spends most of his time sneaking table food to his many dogs (much to Rose's dismay), scolding them in Italian, and grunting his displeasure and exasperation with his family's chaos and morally questionable activities. Despite being frail and old, he is shown to still be very wise and authoritative, condemning Cosmo for breaking the family and demanding that Cosmo pay for Loretta's wedding.All these personalities come together and make a very ordinary story interesting and funny.All in all, I offer one piece of advice See this movie. It's unforgettable.

The film takes place in modern day Brooklyn.The film starts off with Loretta Castoroni (Cher) in a restaurant with Johnny Cammareri (Aiello). Johnny proposes to Loretta and after a bunch of little jokes she agrees to it. Loretta was married once before but her husband was killed by a bus. She claims that she had bad luck because they did not have a proper marriage and she wants it to be so that this time everything goes just right. Loretta lives with her mother and father, as well as her grandfather. She also sees her aunt and uncle very often because they as well live in Brooklyn. Johnny goes to Sicily to be with her on her deathbed and gives Loretta the task of contacting his brother, Ronny (Cage), and inviting him to the wedding. The two brothers have not spoken to each other for five years so Loretta has to patch up their relationship. Well when she goes to see him she doesn't do anything to help patch that relationship up...The screenplay for this film was very good from John Patrick Shanley and he won an Oscar for it. Loretta was a very real character which is always great because an audience can't relate to a main character that seems fake. He did a great job of creating a family vibe and getting a lot of very smart and funny dialogue in the script. Ronny Cammareri was an over the top character yet in a way he added much to the plot because Loretta was so real and down to Earth. Overall a very well written script and a classic romantic comedy.The direction of the film was fine as well. Jewison had many memorable shots throughout the film, such as when Loretta went to confession how only the priest's hands were shown of his and nothing else. Also, I liked how the framing of the shot of Loretta and Ronny looking at the moon, it just had a classic feel to it. Jewison did an excellent job working with his actors since two of them received Oscars the one was nominated. He as well deserved the Oscar nomination that he received.The acting in the film was also very good. Cher gave an excellent performance as Loretta and it is very memorable. She is definitely one of the most talented entertainers out there to be such a great singer and a great actress. What was great about her performance I thought was her eye movement. It was just brilliant the way she looked at the other actors. Nicolas Cage was a little over the top but he needed to be because his character was. His performance does not really show any range, but his career is still young and as it grows he proves that he is as well a great actor. Vincent Gardenia and Olympia Dukakis gave marvelous performances as well as Loretta's mother and father. Gardenia was a very over the top kind of man that was kind of a stock character of a Brooklyn father but he did a fine job as the role. Dukakis was basically an older version of Loretta and played the part as well as Cher. A finely acted film.Overall I give this film a very strong 7/10 because romantic comedies aren't really my favorite genre, but this is one of the best ones out there. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of romantic comedies.

Who knew that Cher could act? Who had ever heard of Olympia Dukakis? Nicholas Cage was the beginning of his career, and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not known for their comedic talents, nor was Norman Jewison the director.The only really flat note in this splendid work is When the Moon Hits Your Eye Like a Big Pizza Pie, That's Amore, a song that is sung too many times in the movie (once is already too many) and that went on to have a long afterlife in popular music. Cher is -- forgive me -- sensational as Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to be married and does not have to be in love with the groom. Aielo (Johny Cammareri) obliges by proposing, offering her his pinkie ring as a substitute for an engagement ring, then rushes off to Sicily to be with his dying mother. He charges Loretta with seeing to that his estranged brother, Ronny, attends the wedding. Loretta confronts Ronny and quickly falls in love with him. Meanwhile, her father (Vincent Gardenia) is cheating on her mother (Olympia Dukakis), which Loretta accidentally discovers when Ronny invites her to the Metropolitan Opera.Everything works out in the end, as it inevitably does in films of this genre. In the meantime, all the actors acquit themselves admirably and the audience enjoys itself. In its way, Moonstruck is how Hollywood used to be at its best rollicking entertainment with no social significance whatsoever. If they'd only lost That's Amore along the way, it would have been perfect.

Most films are lucky to have one scene that is perfect, but director Jewison hit a home run every time. The cast got just the right take on the excellent script, and in addition, Dick Hyman's musical settings of the opera and the other music made for a perfect match. Hard to imagine how they kept the precise mood going throughout the long production of a film. The comedy is subtle (mostly), and the camera-work mirrors every little emotional inflection of the narrative. Cher is such a comedy natural, Vincent Gardenia (who I know mostly through his Frank Lorenzo role on All in the Family until I saw him in this and then off-Broadway in the 80's)deserved far greater stardom than he ever got, and Aiello's hapless loser are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to giving kudos to this tremendous cast.

I have re-visited it many times and it always holds up. A little too stylized for some but I fancy that any opera lover will love it. Norman Jewison, a fellow Canadian, takes enormous chances with his movies and his casting and it nearly always pays off in movies that are off centre and somehow delicious, as this one is. I have often wondered at the paucity of Cher's acting roles, whether she has chosen to minimize this part of her life or she does not get enough good roles to chew on. I have found her to be a superb actress who can retreat into a role, as in this particular one or be loud and daring and fierce as in Mask. I found the comedic strokes broad at times ( a hair salon called Cinderella)but this was the whole intent of both the writer and director. Nicolas Page plays the angst ridden tenor of opera, all extravagant gestures, at one point demanding a knife so as to slit his own throat. The Brooklyn scenes are magical, this is a Brooklyn under moonlight, romanticized and dramatic, just like opera. All in all a very satisfying film not to everyone's taste by a long shot, I loved the ending, everyone brought together like a Greek Chorus, every part subtly nuanced and blending with the others, the camera pulling away down the hall, leaving the players talking. 8 out of 10.

Cher is believable and lovable as Loretta, a tough-and-tender widow of 37, who becomes engaged to sappy, mama's boy Johnny, played by Danny Aielo, whom she likes, but doesn't really love.  As Johnny leaves for Sicily to be with his dying mother, Loretta meets his younger brother Ronny, played by Nicolas Cage, in order to smooth out the bad blood between the brothers and invite him to the wedding...  As the two sort through their stories of blighted lives with loves lost and wrong decisions made, they become drawn to one another with a sort of animal magnetism and they fall for one another.  Meanwhile, Loretta's father, Cosmo, played by Vincent Gardenia, is tinkering outside his marriage with a cannoli named Mona.  Olympia Dukakis does a marvelous job as the steadfast, honorable and wise wife and mother, Rose.The cast plays off each other magically, with natural timing, which makes the story so believable, and makes the quirky family moments even that much more funny.  I hope everyone gets a chance to see this movie, and I hope you enjoy it as thoroughly as I have.

Twelve years later and Norman Jewison's charming tale of love and family in the                            Big Apple is as good as ever.                           The movie was originally intended for Sally Field but when she proved                            unavailable, Jewison plumped for Cher instead. Having released Suspect and The                            Witches of Eastwick in the same year, the rake-thin singer and actress wasn't                            exactly desperate for work. However, there was something about John Patrick                            Shanley's script that worked its magic on her from page one. Cher took one look at                            the role of Loretta, an Italian-American widow in her late 30s, and signed on the                            spot.                           It was a decision she would never regret.As the movie opens, Loretta becomes engaged to Johnny Cammareri (the excellent Danny Aiello), not so much out of love as out of fatigue. But after he flies to Sicily to be at the bedside of his dying mother, she falls for Johnny's estranged younger brother, Ronny (Nicolas Cage).Aside from a great cast, fine photography and a delightful soundtrack, the movie also boasts some of the best dialogue of the Eighties, such as Cage's one-handed baker, desperately trying to make Cher's character fall for him. Loretta, I love you, he pleads. Not like they told you love is, and I didn't know this either, but love don't make things nice - it ruins everything. It breaks your heart. It makes things a mess. We aren't here to make things perfect. The snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. Not us! We are here to ruin ourselves and to break our hearts and love the wrong people and die.Well, quite.On the surface it may look like a star vehicle for Cher but you don't need to be a fan to warm to its charms. This is essentially an ensemble comedy, and a lot of the laughs grow out of the sense of family that Jewison and Shanley create. Needless to say, the movie proved an instant smash hit and also worked its charms on the American Film Academy.Moonstruck landed Cher a Best Actress Oscar, garnered screenwriter John Patrick Shanley a gong for Best Screenplay and turned Nicolas Cage into one of Hollywood's most sought-after actors.If star spotting is your favoured pastime, then look down the cast list and you'll see Frasier's John Mahoney, Julie Bovasso (John Travolta's mum in Saturday Night Fever) and in an Oscar-winning role, Tales of the City's Olympia Dukakis. Oddly enough, Cher literally seems to have turned back time in the dozen years since its release and with the double whammy of a number one song and big screen arthouse hit Tea With Mussolini, it seems Miss Sarkasian is more unstoppable than a dozen Terminators. If you've just had your heart broken or are feeling blue over yet another lottery loss, then you could do worse than curl up on the sofa with a big box of chocs and the drink of your choice.Alas, as with Goodfellas, this is one of those movies where lovers of Italian food should be warned. By the first set of adverts, you may find yourself rushing into the kitchen, cooking a handful of pasta and hoping the Parmesan cheese doesn't give you strange dreams as you enjoy a Moonstruck feast.

It's the story of a young widow who was ready to settle for a dull second husband, and a bitter, injured younger brother (of her fiance) who hates the world and was ready to give up on it.

But alas, it came up against the near perfect The Last Emperor and played runner-up.Moonstruck is a perfect romantic comedy with an ensemble cast. This is rare treat in the tradition of Tootsie and A Fish Called Wanda. All of these films focus on a single character, but the complete cast makes it work.Right down to the Old Man - the aging Italian grandfather, warned by his daughter-in-law to stop feeding table food to his dogs or I'll kick you til you die.Moonstruck follows an Italian American family in New York and how they discover, realize and run from true love. Its best feature is its wonderful mood, perfectly capturing the Italian core family - hostile and critical, but always loving and caring and ready to defend eachother.Cher won a well-deserved Oscar here for delicately playing a stereotype without becoming a caricacture. She agrees in an early scene to Marry Johnny (Danny Aeillo), a man she does not love but feels would make an adequate husband. In the movies best line, Cher's mother (Olympia Dukakis) asks Do you love him, and when Cher answers no, mom says Good. If you love them, they'll drive you crazy because they know they can.It is this tender, bittersweet attitude towards love and relationships that makes this movie watchable and enjoyable. It is an all-time favourite and a must see. Absolutely no objectionable content - just pure fun. A true gift to movie-goers. **** out of ****.

I won't illustrate it - you can see a remarkably long list of quotes on this thread - but any film that can make subjects like the defense of using expensive copper piping rather than brass for plumbing purposes into memorable dialog is amazing to me. It is not the only line that pops up and makes an imprint on our memory. How about a restaurant waiter who regrets a planned marriage proposal because it will mean the loss of an old bachelor client? Or a nice, elderly dog fancier encouraging his pack to howl at he moon? Or Perry (John Mahoney's) description of a female student's youthful promise as moonlight in a martini (my favorite line).MOONSTRUCK is a wonderful example of brilliant script, first rate direction, and a good ensemble cast that fits perfectly. There are other examples (the drama THE OX-BOW INCIDENT is another example, but a grimmer one). Cher, Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardenia, Nicholas Cage, John Mahoney, and Danny Aiello are all involved in plots and cross purposes that examine the nature of love, and how to handle it. Is it a good thing to be totally in love? Cher and Cage, at the end, seem to think so, but Dukakis knows that real love drives the individual crazy (and Cage gets a glimmer of realization of this too, when he and Cher argue outside his home after they return from the opera La Boheme). Is infidelity by men a way of avoiding thoughts of death. Dukakis believes so, and (oddly enough - although he is not totally convinced) Aiello. Chance reveals infidelity - Dukakis realizes early that Gardenia's odd behavior is tied to unfaithfulness, and Cher literally stumbles onto Gardenia and his girlfriend at the opera (but Gardenia also stumbles onto Cher's similar unfaithfulness to Aiello). But chance also causes misunderstandings Fyodor Chaliapin stumbles on Dukakis walking with John Mahoney and thinks that she is having an affair.There are lovely little moments in the film too. Cher's observation about flowers leading to receiving one. Her hearing the argument in the liquor shop and it's resolution. But best is the sequence of Louis Guss and Julie Bovasso as Cher's uncle and aunt Raymond and Rita Cappomaggi and Rita's charming and kind comment to Raymond about the effect of the moonlight on him. It is the sweetest moment of the entire film.It is close to a flawless film. After seeing it over a dozen times in as many years I can only find two points that do not seem as smooth as they should be. When Cher is at Cage's bakery, his assistant Chrissy (Nada Despotovich) mentions how she is secretly in love with Cage, but has been afraid to tell him. Earlier she was slightly snippy towards Cher, who put her in her place quickly. Yet nothing seems done with this potential rivalry. At the same time, the fact that Cher forgets to deposit her uncle and aunt's daily business profits is brought in momentarily in the concluding seven minutes of the film - but just as quickly dropped. Was there supposed to be some plot lines that were dropped, besides one about Cher and Vincent Gardenia working at a homeless man's shelter as penance? It is a small annoyance, but I think it is just based on a desire to see more of this film because it is so very good.

The sexual indiscretions are treated with humour and honesty in an Italian neighbourhood of New York that is more like a village. One amusing scene shows Loretta played by Cher, a 37 year-old widow and daughter of an Italian family, as she makes her confession to the parish priest, who speaks to her on a first name basis. Then she runs into her mother, Rose, played by Olympia Dukakis, praying in church. This typifies the close society of her neighbourhood where the restaurants, churches, delis and corner groceries are meeting places for neighbours and family. The locale is New York City near the Metropolitan Opera, which enters into the story when Loretta and her new boyfriend, played by Nicholas Cage, go on a date. Coincidentally, they happen to spot her father, Cosmo, played by Vince Gardenia, with a girlfriend. Loretta has become engaged to Johnny, performed by Danny Aiello, who she fears will find out about her new boyfriend after his return from Italy. The new boyfriend also happens to be the brother of her fiancé. Things seem to unravel and then be resolved for the family, friends and neighbours under the influence of a full moon. Nicholas Cage and Cher seem to be made for each other in this movie as the still young widow and the hard-luck, angry butcher. It is all great fun for a group of people who have all seen their share of tragedy, success, and strained family relationships. Good luck and good sense does not always win the day. Yet, the movie is full of heart and is something of a lesson on how to put egos aside and let our best instincts work things out. Norman Jewison directed this delightful movie.

She tries to resist, but Ronny lost his hand in an accident he blames on his brother, and has no qualms about aggressively pursuing her while Johnny is out of the country. As Loretta falls deeper in love, she comes to learn that she's not the only one in her family with a secret romance.......Moonstruck is a very odd affair, it's a good film, that goes without saying, but nothing really happens in the film, apart from a few family revaluations that are not that surprising anyway, as you find during the beginning of the second act, there is not one happy member of Cher's Nuclear family.Then the moon comes out and Cher realises that Cage is the one for her. Why? Because he's edgy, he's angry, he's unhinged, and the fact that he more or less forces himself on her makes him irresistible, but then, Aiello is portrayed as a bit of a wet blanket, so,you can't really blame her.But what makes the film so watchable is just how natural the family seem when they are siting around the table eating dinner, or whatever meal it is, and the scene where they are waiting for Johnny to return is an absolute hoot.It's harmless fun, Cher does grieving by adding a little grey to the front of her hair, and Cage is as brilliant as you remember, but you will find yourself wondering at what exact point he got his eyebrows and teeth done.And it also goes to show that My Big Fat Greek Wedding was a cop out, and ripped this film off no end.

I have just seen it for the third time, after several years. It is as fresh as 'a flower newly plucked'. The quirky, tempestuous zest of the irrepressible Cher fills the film with more fizz than a case of Pepsi. (And no, I don't drink such stuff, but you have to admit it is fizzy, if one ignores the aspartame and other dire threats to health.) Cher plays a wildly independent 'handful', the kind of gal who has true character and is very lovable if you can put up with her. Her husband died some time back and she has not found love again, so she is grumpy, being 37 years old and about to settle for the marital proposal of the feeble mama's-boy played by Danny Aiello, whom she proudly tells her mother she does not love. ('That's good,' says the mother, drolly played by Olympia Dukakis.) Aiello flies off to Palermo to see his mother who is always dramatically dying but never does. Before going, he asks Cher to contact his brother. 'What, you have a brother?' asks the incredulous Cher. Aiello says they have not spoken in five years but he must be invited to the wedding. So Cher goes to a great deal of trouble to locate and invite the brother, who turns out to be the young Nicholas Cage. He is pretty much of a slob to look at, but he is charming and passionate, and they fall in love at first sight. Cage is very good indeed at the part. So romantic complications arise. Meanwhile, Cher's parents are having romantic complications of their own. She also has an eccentric grandfather who lives in the house but is in love with his five dogs, so that's OK. He asks his dogs to howl at the moon, and they do. (The moon keeps recurring in the film and wakes everybody up because it is large and full and stirs the blood.) The screenplay of this film by John Patrick Shanley crackles with lively wit, sending off sparks of laughter and satirical asides like an exposed electric cable thrashing about in a storm. And then at the helm is the amazing Norman Jewison, one of Hollywood's best. So this film is a classic, truly it is. They make such affectionate fun of the New York Sicilian Italian families and their quaint ways. (This would make a lot of sense to Nick Cage, who is a New York Sicilian Italian by origin. As for Cher, she seems to be 'Armenian or something'.) Jews and Italians both have mamas and they understand each other, even though the Jews have the better sense of humour about it all. This film is so continuously hilarious and delightful that any attempt to review it, other than as a stand-up comic, is an insult. Anyone with joie de vivre (I know that's not Italian, but I don't know how to say joie de vivre in Italian, do you?) and a sense of fun, and who knows how to laugh, can only be 'over the moon' about MOONSTRUCK, as I have been all these years, and I'm still howling.

As the matriarch, Dukakis not only tries to hold her family together, but she's so good that she also holds this film together. "},{"Title":"That crazy moon","Date":"22 November 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" From The Godfather onwards, the Italian American world was a popular cultural backdrop for movies of all sorts in the 70s and 80s. Most of these were about gangsters (even when they were comedies, as in the 1985 movie Prizzi's Honor), but as Moonstruck shows, there were plenty of other stereotypes to be exploited without resorting to gun-toting Mafiosi.Moonstruck features numerous tropes of Italian culture &#x96; vendettas, elderly matriarchs, romantic opera etc., etc., etc&#x85; Often these are in a satirical light, such as Nicholas Cage's absolutely pathetic excuse for bad blood. But none of this is actually very funny. The movie is really a mess of clichés and crisscrossing romantic subplots, with occasional musings on the nature of love and fidelity, none of which seems quite as intelligent or cohesive as it seems to thinks it is.Cher carries the movie's Italian American cliché through to her performance, which is full of extravagant gesture. She just about keeps the lid on theatricality, and does some fairly good emoting later on, but she was nowhere near deserving of the Academy Award. Nicholas Cage continues his then-current trend of playing the young, pretentious tortured soul, and while he's not outstanding there aren't many actors who could make such a ridiculous figure into a credible romantic lead. Danny Aiello is always fun to see but he is underused here. It is Olympia Dukakis who really gives the picture its only great, solid dramatic performance.Director Norman Jewison directs with an eye towards beauty and eye-catching imagery. Early on, Cher is often duplicated in reflection, concentrating us on her visage. There's a really neat set-up when Cher is on the phone to Aiello, with Aiello's dying mother in the background of one shot and the healthy Dukakis in the equivalent position of the other shot. The whole thing has that wonderful late 80s/early 90s look, of a city glowing in the night, and this is perhaps the only thing I really like about it. That, and the fact that at 100 minutes it is mercifully short. As a romantic movie, it moves me not at all. I speak English and I can even get by in Italian, but for all that it meant to me Moonstruck was incomprehensible.

What an endearing and exquisite romantic comedy &#x85; Moonstruck left me with a gigantic smile and a heart red and shining like a Christmas ball. What more can I ask? Norman Jewison's unpretentious film is like a modest jewel box full of so many small but valuable jewels. I would feel like spoiling the film by using such big words as 'masterpiece' or any superlatives&#x85; let's just say, that you start watching Moonstruck with curious eyes and end up wondering if your heart isn't crying while your lips are smiling.On one hand, Moonstruck is a feel-good movie in the sense that it doesn't use big conflicts before getting more optimistic. The film has no room for bad intentions. It doesn't end as a feel-good movie, the script is confidently positive from beginning to end. Not naive or preachy either, the film invites us to contemplate with a poetic approach, the life of three generations of an Italian American family during two full-moon nights. To those who believe that sunsets are overrated, this is a movie for you. Legend says that full-moon heightens the love inhabiting your hearts and a strange desire strikes men and women they're literally moonstruck. And this magic strikes Loretta, played by Cher in a delightful performance, and a natural, strong but imperceptible, comedic appeal.On the other hand, Moonstruck explores the many forms the most beautiful feeling of the world, take regardless of age, social status, whatever. Love as a universal magic sometimes corrupted by the passing of years and fears. A recurring question is asked by Loretta's mother, Rose. The question is Why do men chase women? The question is simple and despite its depth, the answer really sounds obvious. Because they fear death And as a man, I got it. Love is one thing, but death is a whole other matter. Men indeed have a tendency of desire to conquest, as to prove themselves they still got it. And the idea of dying with the same women is something almost inconceivable.Never cynical, the film avoids the stereotypical comedies' situations and instead of denouncing, its approach is more magnanimous, more understanding. The mood is too positive to let itself embarked in polemics. We're not here to be shocked by the behavior of Cosmo, Loretta's father, cheating on Rose, but to try to understand, why he's doing this. Of course, Rose plays the role with such a poignant authenticity, a serene majesty making her one of the greatest Italian mamas, we can see why Cosmo seeks some more flamboyant sentimental adventures. But the point is that he's lying to himself, trying to be what he's not, and indeed, after a simple but heartbreaking Ti Amo from his wife, he swears between two tears, not to see that woman again. He didn't cheat with his wife, he cheated with his life.So did Loretta actually, in one of the funniest, yet unromantic marriage proposals in the restaurant, she says yes, to a priceless touching Danny Aiello as Johnny, her teddy-bear love. She's unsure as the 'Yes' approves the fear of dying alone. As she felt she wasted her previous marriage by waiting before having a child, unknowing that God would betray her by killing off her husband. It's like women are romantic for the same reason men are unfaithful? Or both are just victims by persuading themselves that this is the thing to do. And thanks to Loretta, when the hazard will lead her to Ronnie's, Johnny's bother, played by a boyish yet magnetic Nicholas Cage, we know they'll end up together, but this is not what will happen, but how it will.The film is just too special to embarrass itself with romantic clichés, it's all about characters knowing each other and trying to cook their lives, with love as the special ingredient. When you think of it, all the characters of these charming gallery have someone to love and someone who loved them. At the end, it's just of matter of sincerity and acknowledging. There is something comical but almost sad in the memorable slap Cher gave Cage, shouting Snap out of it! as she's the one who's in denial, not Cage. After his sincere I love you he takes the slap without reacting as if he was already victim of one bigger slap in the face, his realization that Loretta is the love of her lave. A slap is painless after a moon strike.Rarely a movie had portrayed the splendor of being in love in such a romantic and tender way, so 'bella' and so universal, without that fashioned cynicism. I'm thinking of the other couple who works in the cheese shop, Raymond and Rose, their complicity is so obvious after so many years, you're almost jealous. The whole film is a tribute to love, and punctuates the plot with little old couple who love each other after many years. In a certain way, Moonstruck reconciles between two visions of love traditional, focused on family, built on the past, and modern built on the present, as Ronnie said, which means, with no fear of death anymore.Universally appealing, despite its specific cultural setting, Moonstruck invites us to rediscovers our own vision of love. If we're married, we dream to become like these old couples with a great family, if we're not, we'd love to end with the right person. It's both traditional and modern, it's unique. Moonstruck is like a delicious plate of spaghetti served with a sweet rosy wine, under a full moon light, with a warm summer breeze tickling your neck.Cinema provides so many unforgettable atmospheres, Moonstruck is one of them, floating in pure poetry on its own universe, like the clouds that caress the moon on the night. Moonstruck creates a universe we'd love to be part of, as we'd love to cheer with this family.Kudos to Jewison, for such a magnificent and beautiful romantic comedy!

Norman Jewison directs this Romantic-Comedy, with great sincerity. Cinematography & Editing are good.Performance-Wise Cher is Superb in the central role, from start to end. Her Oscar-Win is justified! Nic Cage is likable as a angry yet lovable guy. Olympia Dukakis, in an also Oscar-Winning role, is genuine. Vincent Gardenia is fabulous. Danny Aiello does well.

Set against an iridescent Manhattan skyline, it follows the romantic misadventures of a sensible 38-year old widow (Cher) engaged to marry a man she calls a lamb while falling in love with her fiancé's wolfish younger brother (a miscast Nicholas Cage). The plot might suggest a knockabout bedroom farce, but the film is more an affectionate Italian-American character piece, charming without trying too hard, and with a surplus of idiosyncrasies for such an otherwise unambitious comedy. Cher has her comic timing honed to a reflex, but she has the advantage of strong support from her temperamental Italian family on screen. It's all pure fluff of course, with a soundtrack drawn from Dean Martin and Giacomo Puccini, but the film is easy enough on the eyes and ears to make any more criticism not worth the effort.

Reviews are disposed to make it sound like a madcap ethnic comedy, and that it is. But there is something more here, an undeniable both pleasant and painful longing that comes across as inexpressibly warm, and a definite mystical element that is indicated in the film's title. This endlessly charming movie has Cher as an aptly down-to-earth Italian-American widow in her late 30s, but she is not the only moonstruck one in the film. There is the moonlit night that her keen but crabby mother Olympia Dukakis goes out for dinner by herself, and meets middle-age university professor John Mahoney whose usual MO is seducing his young students, but who finds in this mature woman a particular unerring sexuality. There is the sneaky and still kind of adorable affair that Cher's father, hilarious Vincent Gardenia, has been carrying on for years with the seasoned, disabused Anita Gillette. And at the core of the story, there is Cher's staggering revelation that she is still capable of love.As the movie opens, she becomes engaged to Mr. Johnny Cammareri, played by Danny Aiello, not so much out of love as out of boredom. But after he flies to Sicily to be at the bedside of his dying mother, she goes to talk to Mr. Johnny's alienated younger brother Nicolas Cage (who though he is indeed Italian is nonetheless the very least Italian actor in this entire film) and is overwhelmed when they are drawn almost spontaneously into a steamy caress. Moonstruck was directed with amazing grace by Norman Jewison and written passionately by John Patrick Shanley, and one of their achievements is empowering the film to be about all of these people. This is an ensemble comedy, and many of the laughs are drawn from the impression of family that Jewison and Shanley establish. There are crisp, priceless occasions of pure Italian-American physical theatricality and grand timing, and others involving the irritation that Dukakis feels for her ancient father-in-law, who lives upstairs with his dogs.As Cher's absent fiancé clings to his mother's bedside, Cher and Cage grow even more hopelessly in love, and Cher learns the story of the enmity between the two brothers. Yet long-harbored resentment and bad blood and timeworn grief and contempt are everywhere in this film. The mother knows, in this manner, that her husband is having an affair. She asks from the depths of her heart why this should be so, and a friend replies, Because he is afraid of dying. She sees immediately that this is so. Though does that make her offer consolation to her husband? Barely No matter where you go, or what you do, you're gonna die. Nonetheless, all of the ardor is emptied of its power to wound, by the ineffable control of the moon, which has beckoned these people and defends them from the ramifications of their weaknesses.This pleasant surprise is permeated by fine performances, even though no one is young or old enough for their roles by any stretch, Cage playing a character about fifteen years older than his real age, eighteen years younger than Cher's and thirty-one years younger than his on-screen brother Aiello, not to mention there is only a fifteen year age difference between Cher and Dukakis, who play mother and daughter. But the delivery is all fine, by Cher, who in spite of an astonishingly generous Oscar win still was never funnier or more self-possessed, by Dukakis and Gardenia as her parents whose love runs as deep as their aggravation, and by Cage as the unfortunate, aggressive brother, who is so brimming with outrage that he has lost track of what began it all. In its affection and in its charm, as well as in its laughs, this is one of that small handful of romantic comedies that truly delivers on both counts.

Check it out on YouTube, search on Moonsock. I think this movie is amazing for several reasons 1. John Patrick Shanley has perfect pitch when it comes to the logic of the Italian-American dialog (an oxymoron). The scene with Cosmo and Johnny (I'll say no more) is a perfect example. As my Italian grandmother used to say, 6 of one, 7 of the other, or If your father were alive, he'd be rolling in his grave. 2. The dialog is so universal to the range of human emotions, that in any given conversation, you could respond with a line from the movie. For example, someone asks, How's your mother? you could respond, She's dead, but I could still hear her big mouth. Try it for a day, you'll see. 3.

I liked it, but I think it may be a tad overrated at times. For me, this was the type of film that could have been a masterpiece, in which some scenes were done so superbly that I just loved them. Other scenes needed some work, however, and some of them left me a little bored and waiting for better. The first 30 minutes or so was spectacular, and I couldn't help laughing at so many things, such as Cher coming home announcing her engagement and her family's response being Again?, though she was only married once. After Cher goes to meet Nicolas Cage, the film slows down and there seem to be less laughs for a while. The ending scene, however, is perfectly done and makes the whole film worth watching, as it is filled with laughs and happy endings. Cher and Olympia Dukakis both deserved their Oscars for this film, and the Oscar-winning screenplay also works well. My main issue is the morals of this film, such as Cher sleeping with Cage on the first night they meet and the father having an affair. Without those issues, we would have a near perfect film on our hands.

It is great to simply see a family with an ordinary business living through ordinary issues, and no Goodfellas anywhere in sight. Yes, I know Cher is Armenian; but all those years married to Salvatore Bono must have left an impression about Italian-American families.

An uncommonly cavalier attitude toward such casual intimacy.

Set in the Italian region of New York under a moon so big and bright, glowing down on the characters, casting its spell of joyous love on them.  At the front line are Loretta Castorini (Cher), her fiancée's brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage) and her mother (Olympia Dukakis) and father (Vincent Gardenia).  These characters, among others, fall in love with each other and others.Loretta is the central character, and her story is started when Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) proposes to her.  She accepts, and Johnny flies off to Sicily to be there when his ill mother dies, but he leaves Loretta instructions to call up his estranged brother Ronny and invite him to the wedding, in an effort to settle some `bad      '.  She visits Ronny, who works in a butcher shop, and we meet him when she does, in one of the film&#145;s grandest scenes.  She learns that the `bad      ' is that, five years earlier, Johnny         ally distracted Ronny while he was using a meat slicer, resulting in the loss of his hand, and his own fiancée left him because of the disfigurement.  Ronny is a complex character but an easy one to accept, Cage comically combining the manly ferocity of Stanley Kowalski and the kind of goofiness you'd see in a Mel Brooks film.  His best scene is when he shouts in anger at his wooden hand as a stunned Loretta watches.But, surprisingly, Johnny's absence over the next two nights of the full moon and its spell allows Loretta to find love she never thought she'd have in Ronny.  Meanwhile, her mother Rose learns that her husband Cosmo is seeing a         , and starts searching for the answer to why men always chase women.  Rose also has a sort of         al dinner with a college professor (John Mahoney).  He's looking for a woman, but she's just looking for release, and when he asks her to come to his apartment she refuses because she `knows who she is'.  But, still, it's a great scene, mostly because of the writing.  Rose isn't turned into a weepy mess because of the news on her husband, and Mahoney isn't a    -crazed, slimy character; he sort of looks on in wonder as she dispenses all the knowledge she's gained with a quiet, confident wisdom.It's not a sad story, though, and the characters all come together at the end, in the best scene, in Rose's kitchen at breakfast time.  The scene is funny and touching, when everything is resolved.  Rose demands Cosmo stops seeing his         .  He allows himself a moment of anger (hitting the table) and then nods, quietly, and agrees, because he loves his wife dearly.  Johnny also arrives, confused at everyone's strange behavior, but not angry.  And, of course, the right people end up with the right people, but it's not as obligatory as it sounds.The cast is wonderful, especially Cher (in her Oscar winning role) who surprised me with her greatness, the funny and poetic Cage, Dukakis is awesome as the wise mother (she also won) and last but not least Gardenia, a perfect Italian father, who took a potentially        character and made him lovable.  And the others - Mahoney, Aiello - are great in there scenes too.Still, there are quite a few flaws.  Norman Jewison's direction could've been a lot better, personally I don't think he captured the fairy-tale grandness of a lot of the scenes very well (the Italian New York feel was mastered in `Marty').  But it's not Jewison's worst work, and now that I mention Marty I think it's possible he gained some inspiration from it (the scene where Cher kicks a can is reminiscent of the scene in Marty where Ernest Borgnine swats a Stop sign).  The writer could've worked harder too, some scenes seem too long and aimless.But, a good film nonetheless, with terrific performances and some truly great scenes, 7.5/10.

When he goes to Italy to be with his mother as she dies, Loretta goes to invite his brother to their wedding.  When Loretta and Ronny end up sleeping together it sparks an affair that risks ending her engagement.  However as she tries to deal with it she finds that the relationships of the rest of her family are just as convoluted.I can't remember if this film won awards or anything but I do have it stuck in my head that it is a good film and well worth a look.  To confirm this unexplained impression I decided to watch it last week and found a film that, while quite enjoyable, doesn't really have too much going for it outside of some stereotypical Italian mama-mia charm.  The plot features a couple of tangled relationships - be they loving marriages, damaged marriages or affairs.  The plot doesn't really do much with any of the threads other than bring them all together towards the end, and, as a result, it heavily relies on the charm from the characters to carry it.  This it does pretty well and the characters are quite amusingly exaggerated or stereotyped (depending on your point of view).  Only Loretta and Cosmo really emerge as characters with a touch of reality to them.Cher does OK with her character and down plays it fairly well.  In contrast, Cage hams at any chance - he's the most tragic man i know comments a character and, boy, does Cage make sure that we never doubt the validity of that statement.  Gardenia is great as Loretta's father and produces one of the more subtle yet comic characters; Dukakis is also good as his wife.  Aiello is given a pretty thankless role but does OK and various other walking ethnic stereotypes drift in and out like a pizza advert.Overall this has enough gentle charm to win over the weaknesses in the plot and characters.  The central romance doesn't really ring true and the film relies on the slightly comical characters to keep things going.  A little sentimental at times without having a real heart of it's own but enough charm to make it worth watching.

There have been plenty of very good and worthy comedies nominated for Oscars. As Good As It Gets, Little Miss Sunshine, Juno, A Serious Man. But there is no question that one of the best ones has to be Norman Jewison's Moonstruck. It is easily one of the most delightfully funny (and it's hilarious by the way), charming, clever, and entertaining films ever. And it has a 7 on IMDb. Outrageous.Moonstruck tells the story of Loretta (Cher in her Oscar-winning role), a widowed Italian woman who has just gotten engaged to Johnny (Danny Aiello). Johnny says that he won't marry her until his mother is dead (she is dying very soon). So when he goes to visit his mother, he asks Loretta for a favor Invite his estranged brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage), who had a falling out with him some years ago, to the wedding. But once Loretta and Ronnie meet, something unexpected happens. They fall in love.I'm thinking it, so I am going to say it. Moonstruck should have won Best Picture. I don't know what The Last Emperor is, and if I don't know what it is, then it probably didn't matter. Moonstruck is not just a great movie, but it's also great for a romantic comedy. I love a comedy that feels real even though there is nothing to take seriously. Moonstruck is just that movie.Cher and Olympia Dukakis are wonderful. I don't know if I can quite say that Cher deserved Best Actress (she beat Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction), but she is terrific. Loretta is quite a character, and that character may not have came alive as well without Cher's charisma. Olympia Dukakis, who plays her mother, is terrific mainly due to her sarcasm. Also, believe it or not, a good Nicolas Cage used to exist, and that is him in this movie.I love Moonstruck. It is easily the best movie of 1987, and it should have won the award. But I'm glad that it won Best Screenplay, Supporting Actress, and Actress. Easily one of the greatest romantic comedies of them all. IMDb needs to boost up their ratings a little bit. Put Magnolia, Boogie Nights, Tootsie, Titanic, and Moonstruck on the Top 250 today!

MOONSTRUCK not only picked up an Oscar for Cher but the screenplay also won as did Olympia Dukakis for Best Supporting Actress. I'm not going to call this a bad movie because the performances are way too great and there's no question that the screenplay has some great dialogue but I must admit that I'm quite confused by some of the praise this film has received. It seems most reviewers see this as a four-star movie and some consider it one of the best of the decade and there are even some who consider this one of the greatest movies ever made. I thought it was charming and sweet at spots but I can't help but think it's highly overrated by many. While the dialogue might have been terrific and could have been the reason it picked up the Oscar, I thought the story itself wasn't all that impressive. What really kept me from connecting with the movie was the fact that I really didn't care about any of the characters. The love triangle between Cher and the brothers really wasn't all that interesting nor was the issues going on between her parents (played by Dukakis and Vincent Gardenia). I thought that all of the characters seemed to be trying to spoof the Italian stereotypes and it just didn't work for me as it didn't make me laugh nor did it make me care for those I was watching. With that said it might sound strange that I'd still recommend the movie but there's no question that the performances are great. Cher not only perfectly nails that accent but she also manages to be very believable in the part of this widow. I thought that inner toughness she brought to the role was great and she also shares some great chemistry with the supporting cast. Dukakis is good in her role but I thought it was Gardenia who nearly stole the film as the cheating husband. Aiello could play this type of role in his sleep so there's no issues with him. Cage is the main reason to watch the movie as he perfectly nails the part and also manages to get quite a few laughs and especially early on when we first meet his depressed character. Director Norman Jewison handles the material quite well and keeps the film moving at a nice pace. MOONSTRUCK is obviously a film loved by many. I can't say I share that feeling but the performances and dialogue make it worth watching.

Another hackneyed performance by Nicholas Cage undoes the work of an otherwise superb cast. I deeply admire Norman Jewison. I believe he intends to make serious films. He has great skill as a storyteller. He addresses important social and political themes. There are moments in this film that utterly delight this viewer. Cinematography by David Watkin, one my favourite cinematographers and a very much unappreciated one, brings immense joy to watching this movie. I don't know if he or Mr. Jewison is responsible for the close up of eggs in the middle. I love that shot. I also very much love the score by composer Dick Hyman. It is a perfect work for this film. No one does better film scores than Mr. Hyman, whose remarkable work with Woody Allen became an important part of my love of many classic Allen films. The script by John Patrick Shanly, the writer of Joe Versus the Volcano, a much neglected and undervalued film, seems (to me) to personify a love of New York and Italian New York culture and society. This is beautiful writing. If editor Lou Lombardo had somehow been able to edit Nicholas Cage from this work, the film would rate close to a ten. The rest of the cast does outstanding work. For a look at what Mr. Jewison did achieve look at Fiddler on the Roof, A Soldier's Story, or The Hurricane. At any rate, this is a fine work to enjoy in spite of that fundamental flaw in casting.

Cher almost makes up for this with her reactions to Cage's shifting accent and out of control body language. Cage simply never settles into his role. He tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than real person and that's what's needed in a love story. Cage has had these same kind of performance problems in other roles that require more of a Jimmy Stewart type character. Cage keeps taking these roles, perhaps because he likes those kind of movies but his own energy as an actor doesn't lend itself to them, though he's gotten better at it with repeated attempts. He should leave these type of roles to less interesting actors who would fully commit to the film and spend his energy and considerable talent in more off beat roles and films where he can be his crazy interesting self.

It is almost perfect, the right actors play the right roles, the story touches the heart of every (Italian) immigrant, Dean Martin's song comes always at the right moments, and the director from whom we unfortunately have movies like The Fiddler on the roof and Jesus Christ Superstar, did for once in his life a masterpiece.The Italian language plays a very important role in this movie, since the story plays exclusively amongst Italian immigrants and their descendants in a kind of Little Italy in New York. The bakery, the grocery, the flower shop, even the funeral parlor are Italian. And everybody seems still to speak Italian, although it is astonishing that in Moonstruck, one hardly hears one complete Italian sentence. However --- what Italian do we hear? Feodor Chaliapin, who plays the grandpa, is for the director (interview in the specials) a famous Italian actor who worked with Fellini. In reality, Chaliapin was a Russian who spoke almost as bad Italian as he spoke English, and he had an uncredited extra-role in Roma and not one main film role in his life. Everybody who understands Italian recognizes that he addresses his dogs in the singular formal way instead of using the informal plural which he uses only when he says guardate la bella luna. Chaliapin even addresses Vincent Gardenia, although this one plays his son, in the formal way. The few Italian words he uses when he talks to his alleged Italian emigrant-friends in the scene on the cemetery, are completely mistaken. The waiter in the restaurant Il Ticino (whose name is interestingly Swiss and not Italian), the very much underrated great Robert Weil, serves a minestroni instead of a minestrone. Even for Dean Martin who supposedly grew up Italian speaking, candela (candle) rhymes first with bella and second with fellow (fella). Martin seems to switch freely between amore and amori. One more word about the name of Loretta's family. I have full understanding for people who change their name after they arrive in the U.S., because they are suffering from the constant mispronunciation. However, the Italian name for the server is cameriere. Besides that, there is a family name Cammariere, but no such name as Cammareri, pronounced approximately as ka-ma-re-rey. Since this name can be heard at least twenty times in the movie, it hurts one's ears. Similar is the case of Cappomaggi which is correctly Capomaggio. The only one whose one Italian sentence is fully correct is Vincent Gardenia's Anch'io ti amo. He was born - as it sung by Dean Martin - back in old Napoli.

Basically Loretta Castorini (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Cher) is the simple thirty-something Brooklyn bookkeeper asked by nice and simple, but also slightly dull middle-aged fellow Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello), to marry him, and she accepts. She has put off getting married again for many years as she lost her last husband after he was killed in a bus accident, and she believes it is the location she got married, City Hall, that cursed their life together. Loretta admits to her mother Rose (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Olympia Dukakis) that she is not marrying Johnny because she truly loves him, she just feels it is a safe and sure thing to do, but even though her mother suspects it, she is unaware he is cheating on her. Loretta meanwhile has met his estranged brother Ronny (Golden Globe nominated Nicolas Cage), who works the ovens of a neighbourhood bakery, and he lost his left hand to a cursed wedding of his own, she is inviting him to their wedding. They do start off bickering and disagreeing a lot at first, but as she and Ronny spend more time together they do find a connection, and form a passionate love affair that may change the wedding plan. In the end, it turns out Johnny changes his mind about the engagement for the sake of his mother, and Ronny takes advantage of this relieving moment proposing to Loretta himself, to which she accepts happily, and all the family celebrate with champagne. Also starring Oscar nominated Vincent Gardenia as Cosmo Castorini, Julie Bovasso as Rita Cappomaggi, John Mahoney as Perry and Louis Guss as Raymond Cappomaggi. Cher does indeed prove that she is a credible actress with her charming performance, there is still a tiny bit of me preferring Glenn Close won the Oscar, but I can let the singer off in a way, Cage is also very impressive as the emotionally tortured but likable love interest for her, it is a pretty simple setup where the girl falls for the brother of the man she is going to be marry, but with witty script and dialogue and terrific acting this is a fun and watchable romantic comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated for Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Score for Dick Hyman and Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay. It was number 96 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (Snap out of it!), it was number 17 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, and it was number 41 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

Wonderful characters and performances by all. I loved the music and the way the music was incorporated into the scenes. There are few movies I care to own because I would never watch them a second time. The performances in Moonstruck are so engaging that I like to replay them over and over. In case anyone doesn't know what this movie is about.....Loretta, Cher, has no luck or bad luck. She is desperately marrying a man who is OK with her but she is definitely not head over heels in love with him. She is getting into her 30's with graying hair. She goes to meet her fiance's brother to find out what the bad blood is between them and why he won't come to the wedding. That night several people get moonstruck.

Upon her acceptance of his Proposal of Marriage he's off to Palermo to inform his dying mother that he will be married.  In the meantime Cher is left to invite his estranged brother to the wedding.  She is unprepared to meet Ronny (Nick Cage), a bitter shell of a man who has lost in love and can summon no joy for his brother's impending nuptials.  What she does as she does with everyone is take care of him only to find that he fills her with emotions that she doesn't have for her fiance.  Their dialogue about why he is at odds with his brother were classic and hilarious all at once.The characters plays nicely off each other and the whole family is typical of Italian-American - from the style of cooking to their mannerisms. Olympia Dukakis' Rose was phenomenal and her portrayal as the intuitive wife to Vincent Gardenia's Cosmo was wonderful; she completely stole the show! Cher slipped surprisingly easily into the role of Loretta like a glove and although at times her Italian accent seemed a little too Italian she was impressive.  Danny Aiello was a great comic foil and the other supporting characters could have easily been cast from true New Yorkers.Full of lots of outside shots of New York City this is a great date movie served best with a good bottle of wine and fresh Italian bread!

I own that film on DVD! The movie deals with a New York widow (Cher) who falls in love with her boyfriend's (Danny Aiello) angry brother (Nicholas Cage) who works at a bakery. I'm glad Cher won an Oscar for that movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are great, too. The direction from Norman Jewison (who directed Fiddler On The Roof) is fantastic. Moonstruck is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh. A must-see!10/10 stars!

As the plot consists only of a predictable romance, whether you like it depends largely on whether you find tough stoopid Noo Yorkers heartwarming or merely wearisome.  Quite funny in places, but quite how it won all those Oscars is hard to fathom.

Although I'm no Cher fan, she gives an excellent performance and her part was well written.  The cinematography was well done and captures a sense of romance.The Rest a thin plotline, Nicholas Cage's performance, and a totally unhumorous and weak attempt to portray an Italian-American family from New York.  Firstly, everytime time Cage opened his mouth I cringed.  I don't know what kind of accent he was trying use.  I honestly don't, it sure wasnt any New York or Italian accent I've ever heard.  It was quite surreal. And it wasn't because I'm some stickler for accuracy, his voice just cloyed in my ears.  And I like Nicholas Cage in other performances.  Secondly, and this is purely anecdotal, but I have many Italian relations, friends and acquaintances in New York City, and frankly I've gotten more laughs and felt more joy in the appreciation of the Italian ethnic family by far than this movie provided.  And that would be on a boring night at the house.  What a let down.

Granted, there were long term side-effects and risks of brain damage, memory loss (and) intellectual impairment, upon the screening such a film. A 1989 survey of Moonstruck fans by the UK Advocacy Network revealed that one-third of 300 Moonstruck fans surveyed believed Moonstruck had damaged them and an astounding 80% claimed it had irreparably destroyed their minds.Cher plays someone very un-Cher in this movie, a dowdy young widow named Loretta living in New York with her extended family. They're anti-American, pro-Italian and always at each other in someway. She has been going out with Johnny Camarary for a while, a nice mamma's boy man, and he asks her to marry him. She says yes. I loved her mom's questions Do you love him Loretta?, No., Good. If you love him he'll drive you crazy because they know they can. But you like him then?, Oh yeah, he's a sweet man Ma. When Johnny goes off to Sicily to care for his dying mother, he asks that Loretta make contact with his brother who he's been estranged from for years.This victory for human rights carries even greater significance, as Sicily was the birthplace of electroshock treatment. In 1938, Italian psychiatrist Ugo Cerletti, saw slaughterhouse workers using electric shock devices to cause epileptic fits in pigs, easing the job of slitting their throats. Cerletti was inspired, and began experimenting with electroshock on humans, developing the first Electroshock machine. Broken bones and fractured vertebrae that resulted from the convulsions appeared to be of little concern.This was,in so many ways, an anti-American movie. It's about love, to be sure, but it's also about infidelity, secrets, lonely people, and strange behavior brought on by American policies. The characters, from the frumpy BoBo at the favorite restaurant, the aunt and uncle, her parents and their problems, the ancient grandfather and his dogs are all well developed and intrinsic characters. It's somewhat of a chick flick, as it's how Loretta stops being a dowdy stuffed shirt and awakens the flower of the inner vamp. It's a Cinderella story in many ways, and that is every little girl's dream to emerge from the ugly duckling into a beautiful swan...Assuming free and fully informed Consent, it is well to reaffirm the individual's right to pursue happiness through brain damage if he or she so chooses. But we might ask ourselves whether we, as fans of cinema, though in no way sworn to any Hippocratic Oath, should be offering it.

My life cannot go on... i accidentally cut off my own hand...my brother was close by. Obviously his fault. And since when have happy endings included the nice guy who takes care of Mom sad and alone. No closure, bad script, and doesn't have enough extension of minor characters. Save yourself, unless your up for a good laugh. Costumes were done appropriately, and extras did a fabulous job. I'm sure it would have been a fun movie to make, but keep it more genre specific, I can't recommend this movie to anyone I know, because it is not an intellectual movie. It is not a chick flick. It is not a strict romantic. And I can't show kids because of the sex and questions to follow. All in all, just not a good flick.
