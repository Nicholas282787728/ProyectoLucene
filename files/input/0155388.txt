Therefore, my evaluation of it purely concerns the film itself.   I saw the movie during its brief stint in American theaters, and I was very surprised.  It is the sort of film that I was amazed made it into Anerican movie theaters at all.  It is neither fast-moving nor action-packed, and it contains no sexual content or violence.  It centers around a functional British family and has very little romance.  It does, however, address many issues and has a great deal of sophisticated humor.Rebecca Pidgeon's performance was particularly memorable.  She had the perfect combination of restraint and sarcasm.  I have heard complaints about her-that she was too stiff and lackluster, but I found her character very believable.  Perhaps this is because I come from a close, sarcastic family myself.  The Winslows came off as very attached to each other, but their Britishness prevented them from being mushy.  I would definitely not recommend this movie to everyone.  It is a very specific type of film and probably would be enjoyed by someone who is a fan of slow-paced, dialogue-driven period pieces or by someone who is a bibliophile.  It is an unusual film, but I personally think it is pure gold.

Last year it was Shakespeare in Love and Elizabeth and this year it is An Ideal Husband and The Winslow Boy.  I also liked Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels but that's another story.  Why our fascination with the English?  I have some theories but I guess I shouldn't get into that here.  The Winslow Boy is a terrific film because of its simplicity.  A father defending his son's and thereby his own honor.  There are no gimmicks, violence, and stunts, and everything and everyone is what and who they appear to be.  As a result this film is driven by strong characters and strong, terse dialogue.  I also enjoyed the use of newspaper clippings and caricatures from the editorial page to guide us thru the movie.  The use of a scripture which appears a couple times dealing with feast and famine was a great metaphor for the father and the family's prospects.  The performances were spectacular, especially Jeremy Northam playing Sir Robert Morton....what a stage presence.  Rebecca Pidgeon as Kate as the strong willed suffragette daughter in the family was good as well.  I must also mention Nigel Hawthorne, the father on whom the struggle took its toll, performed strongly as usual.  I would recommend this to all members of the family from the very young for whom it could teach value lessons to the very old for whom it may awaken some feelings of nostalgia for at times it feels like a film from the 40's.

A satisfying film indeed -- down to the very last word spoken.","Date":"12 June 1999","Score":"27 out of 28 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  A MUST SEE for Mamet fans and anyone who appreciates performances by Nigel Hawthorne, Jeremy Northam and Rebecca Pidgeon -- a pinnacle tour de force! It's costume drama, if you fancy PBS Masterpiece Theater productions, you'll definitely enjoy it.Simply Perfect. It's perfection to a tea (high tea at four). It's so comfortable and relaxing to watch a Mamet film even when it's a story of intrigue and suspense.Without stress of anticipation or worrying how the film might turn out, I entered the theater already satisfied -- I am seeing a Mamet film (a relieve from the Hollywood blockbusters!)  I totally trusted the writer/director, serenely sat there knowing I will have a pleasant film experience, and immensely enjoyable it truly was!Every character is well acted by a perfect cast! Nigel Hawthorne as the senior Winslow, Arthur, head of the family. Gemma Jones as the matron of the house, Mrs. Winslow, Grace. Rebecca Pidgeon (Catherine Kate Winslow the daughter who works for her cause in women suffrage) flawlessly matches Jeremy Northam (Sir Robert Morton the renowned lawyer who has his influence on the House of Commons). What a fine pair opposite each other. Northam is impeccable and as handsome as he is. Pidgeon is no less brilliant and shines reflectively. There are the other two sons in the Winslow family the key role of the Winslow boy in question, Ronnie, played by Guy Edwards, and the older son Dickie played by Rebecca's brother Matthew Pidgeon. Also Sarah Flind as the twenty-four years faithful family servant Violet, Colin Stinton as cousin Desmond and Aden Gillett as fiancé John (the two men who keenly pursue Kate) just about do the job for this faultlessly put together story on film.Mamet's screenplay once again superbly presented. Every line, every word in every scene came across so befitting for the moment -- such timing and delivery. This is a politically conscious film subjects include family unit value, honor and honesty, class structure, influence of a well-known lawyer, along with father and son relationship, father and daughter, husband and wife, and romantic notions being tossed about around Kate -- all integrally paced yet seemingly choreographed together so effortlessly.Mind you the case is not the only central interest, the tension (and subtle tender friendship) between Kate Winslow and Sir Robert Morton is fascinating to watch, as they grow to observe each other closely and exchange banters. Kate, with her seemingly restrained manners, is holding back her feelings, while Sir Robert is opening up steadily and showing (obvious to us viewers) interest in getting to talk to Kate more often than he would a man of his stature.For me, there are four key scenes of exceptional energy, be it in high or low-key delivery. 1) Arthur Winslow (Nigel Hawthorne) talking initially with Ronnie (Guy Edwards). 2) When Kate (Rebecca Pidgeon) first entered Sir Robert's office, our very first glimpse of Sir Robert (Jeremy Northam) and his initial reaction. 3) Sir Robert interrogating Ronnie in his office. 4) The last verbal exchange between Pidgeon and Northam, as Kate and Sir Robert bid goodbye -- miss not a single word of this as you will be satisfied (probably more music to a woman's ears when Northam speaks!)Music score by Alaric Jans complements the film effectively, so do the costume design by Consolata Boyle and photography by Benoit Delhomme. All in all, I repeat, a perfectly satisfying and enjoyable film. Bravo to Mamet, once again.Other gems (screenplay-director) by Mamet besides The Spanish Prisoner 1998, are his first film House of Games 1987 and Things Change 1988. They both have the unique energy of Joe Mantegna, and fascinating strong lead performances from Lindsay Crouse in the former and Don Ameche in the latter -- perfect casting they were, with music score both by Alaric Jans. If you appreciate well written dialog and plot, miss these not.

This 1999 version is by the American director David Mamet, with his wife Rebecca Pidgeon in a lead role as the Boy's sister Catherine, along with Nigel Hawthorne and Gemma Jones as the parents. The acting honours however truly belong to Jeremy Northam as their barrister, Sir Robert Morton, who finds himself strangely attracted to young Ms Winslow. He is the full QC-MP, urbane, smooth as silk (dammit he is a silk) and deeply cynical, scambling up the greasy pole at Westminster, using his legal skills as best he may. Yet he compromises his career by taking the case. It involves the absurdly trivial matter of the alleged theft of a five shilling postal order but by the time it's over Sir Robert and his clients have managed to put the Navy and half the government on trial. Northam make this almost unbelievable transformation seem not just likely but inevitable.`The Winslow Boy' is of course based on a real case, the Archer-Shee affair, though Rattigan modified the story substantially. In particular the Archer-Shee's counsel, Edward Carson, the prosecutor of Oscar Wilde and raving anti-Irish home ruler, never became personally involved with the family. He was made a law lord (top British judge) shortly after so his quite spectacular career was not affected by his involvement in the  Archer-Shee case. Yet the most interesting thing in the film is the entirely ficticious relationship between Sir Robert, the conventional male supremacist and Catherine, the dedicated suffragette. In the end sex triumphs over politics, as it so often does. A pity it did not do so in the case of Lord Carson.The Boy himself has a wonderful line in English Public School patter (I'm sure an American audience would need sub-titles). Sadly the real Boy was killed in WW1, which also killed the society to whom the Archer-Shee case was so important.

I saw this one sitting on the shelf of my local video store and rented it on a lark.  This is an adaptation of a play written by the late Terence Rattigan (The Browning Version, Separate Tables).  Here it is brought to the screen by another famous playwright, David Mamet, who wrote the screenplay and directed this film.  It concerns the true story of a young boy who was expelled from the British Naval Academy early in the twentieth century for allegedly stealing a postal order.  This movie is very much a play put onto film.  The sets are almost exclusively interior and the action is carried forward through dialogue.  Events not at hand are explained through theatrical devices such as reading a letter or someone remarking on what's happened.  At times I wished the director had made it more of a movie but it's still a very good film, mainly because the key actors are so good.Mamet's wife, Rebecca Pidgeon, plays Catherine Winslow, the little boy's older sister.  She's an outspoken but gentle woman who's strongly in favor of women's rights.  Jeremy Northam plays Sir Robert Morton, the lawyer and member of the House of Commons who takes the Winslow case.  He's outwardly reserved but inside he's as passionate about justice as Catherine.  Both of these actors give outstanding performances.  And as you might expect, there's a little romance suggested between the two by the end of the film.I wish I knew more about the Winslow case because the film assumes you know most of the facts already.  It must have been an important event in early twentieth century British history because they've made several films about it, including one made in 1948 with Robert Donat (Sir Robert Morton), Margaret Leighton (Catherine), and Cedric Hardwicke (the boy's father) that I'll have to see.  There must be nuances about the relationship between the government and the common man in this case that are only hinted at here.Very good entertainment and the acting will knock you off your feet.

The youngest and very dear son has been accused of theft at his school and expelled. The boy swears his innocence to his father & family so the patriarch begins a court proceeding to clear his son of any wrong doing. A rising young attorney (Jeremy Northam) is found willing to accept the defense of the boy. The publicity is intense, making the older sister's wedding engagement in jeopardy. Will the family continue to try and prove their son's case or will circumstances make them give up the fight?This is a beautiful movie, in many ways. The cast is stellar, but, especially, the handsome and intelligent Jeremy Northam excels in his role as the attorney. The sister's role is also portrayed very well and her feisty yet genteel character is extremely attractive. The sets are lovely, the minor characters deft, and the costumes are superb. Mostly, though, the script and direction are of the highest caliber, showcasing what is good and noble in a family with exceptionally high morals. Do you want good character building films without any objectionable scenes, which are also highly enjoyable? This one should make the top ten list every time.

Their breath of fresh air soon became a gale of fetid air and the complacent middle-aged men soon had their slippers back in the hearth -some of the former A.Y.M.joining the ranks of the reactionaries. Mr Terence Rattigan's story of the boy accused of theft and his family's extraordinary campaign to prove his innocence is open to the same questions of interpretation.Ronnie Winslow's guilt is never considered by anyone except his prospective counsel,and,in a rather melodramatic scene,he too appears to be convinced that a miscarriage of justice has taken place.Or does he just take on the case to get closer to the boy's sister?Is it the film's premise that no price is too high to pay nor is any cause more noble than establishing the truth - or is it that truth becomes irrelevant in the battle between two opposing lawyers or in the escalating juggernaut of publicity? Set in the uneasy peace preceding the first world war,The Winslow Boy examines that most excoriated of institutions,the middle class family. Gruff but loving paterfamilias,supportive wife/mother,strong-willed independent-minded daughter,charming,polite but slightly rakish older son and the eponymous younger son.The dynamics of such a group of people are skilfully portrayed in a number of short well-written scenes that establish their relationships.Mr Nigel Hawthorne and Miss Gemma Jones are outstanding as the parents,she having the more difficult task of seeming slightly subservient and at the same time the real strength of the family and the one holding it together.Mr Hawthorne starts off the epitome of male rationality and at the end of the film has become obsessed by his campaign perhaps even to the edge of madness,whilst Miss Jones despite her emotional involvement with her younger son becomes more pragmatic as the campaign goes on.Driven to virtual bankruptcy by the costs(echoes of Bleak House here)the Winslows are driven closer together by the experience. Miss Rebecca Pigeon plays Kate,the rebellious New Woman,cigarette smoking supporter of womens' suffrage.She is completely believable in the role and I can only think that the severe criticism of her is of the sour grapes variety.Her brother Matthew plays her brother and it works very well.There is a subtle interplay between them that reflects their real-life relationship and enhances all their scenes together. Kate supports vaguely leftish causes that are anathema to her father and is ambivalent about briefing the eminent barrister Sir Robert Morton,scourge of the Trade Union movement(the devastatingly handsome Mr Jeremy Northam) but he wins her over by declaring his belief in her brother's innocence after a cross-examination in his office. As the family's money is gradually drained away Kate loses her Lifeguards officer fiancé but doesn't seem unduly bothered despite declaring lifelong love for him to her motherI love him in every possible way a woman can love a man,she told her discomfited parent.The family solicitor (Mr Colin Stinton) her devoted swain for years is gently rejected and her relationship with Sir Robert Morton slowly develops from confrontation to co-existence with room for development. At the end of the court case the two have a loaded conversation and the final exchange is worthy of Oscar Wilde. Guy Edwards as Ronnie Windsor recalls the kind of boy who once rolled hoops along the banks of the Serpentine under Nanny's careful eye. The change from fierce denial to apparent disinterest in his fate is well-observed.From a slightly sanctimonious prig he turns into a readily recognisable somewhat bemused teenager whose priorities in life have inevitably altered.Only Mr Hawthorne's steely determination remains unbending and he has paid for it not only financially but also with his health.Whether it is a price worth paying is the question at the heart of this film.

Donat has been missing for far too long          from the cable stations and video rental lists. I'm getting a campaign started to force Amc and TMC to bring back all the old Donat films such as the original version of The Winslow Boy, Count of Monte Cristo, etc. First I'd like to state that by comparing Mr. Northams' performance to Mr. Donats' that I'm in no way diminishing it. On the contrary I find that his ability to evoke the memory of Donat lies in an amazing talent and an astounding technique. His first appearance in The Winslow Boy more than satisfied my glee at the casting of him in this role. When he first steps into the view of the camera, glimpses Catherine and then holds his legal files against him as if to shield his nakedness,( he is of course only naked in the sense that he is not entirely appropriately dressed without his tailcoat)my heart leapt at the thought that I was in for a deja vu movie experience. Excellant direction by Mr. Mamet.I was further pleased throughout the film to realize that although he was pulling out all the wonderful Donatisms, I never once for a moment doubted his sincerity in the role. He was Sir Robert and he was at that moment truely smitten. Mr. Northams' ability to let you see his characters thoughts is so finally tuned he hardly needs his own remarkable gift with dialogue. Other fabulous Donat moments from the film His court room orations, No sir' I will not stand down, very reminiscent of Young Mr. Pitt and his stuttering admonition not to endow an unimportant incident with a romantic significance.Richard Hannay and Mr. Chips are alive and well. And don't get me started on the sexuality of the cigarette smoking.Also check out on the video his uncanny ability to match his shots in cuts on action.Well thats enough about Mr Northams riveting multi-leveled performance. Mr Mamets restrained, precise, intelligent direction, breathed such vital life in to this 53 yr. old stage play that I'm eager to see what else he has planned. And how many other actors are lining up to work with him. This is a director who knows what he wants.  Most of you have already pointed so many of this films tremendous merits I won't be redundant by repeating them. That is after all Mr. Mamets gig. But to the others of you who claimed to of missed the point or couldn't see the tension, drama or eroticism than all I have to say to you is,stuffy, wordy, Edwardian drawing room drama, my aunt Fannie.

Mamet usually overdelivers. But with his Vanya and this play, both adaptations, he explores subtle layering. What the layering concerns is the second point. But the fashion of the layering in this case is extreme understatement. One can see where Mamet is experimenting to see how far he can go, and that's not too enjoyable, since the mechanics of writing show. He was masterful with Vanya. Here, he tries too hard.But the point of the play is very fine. Here we have yet another film about acting. The event which gets the wheel turning is a young boy who lies about his guilt. (His guilt is never really in doubt as the overwhelming evidence is presented...Spoiler ahead! ...and he is acquitted in an OJ-like confabulation of legal tricks. This is why the British public was so upset.)But never mind that the boy is acting. Or that his father is pretending to believe in the family's honor. Or never mind the other minor Victorian deceits (that the maid pretends to not know of her impending dismissal, the black sheep son pretends to not despise his father, or that the soldier pretends to love his fiance.)No, this film is about the lawyer/lord. Jeremy Northam is perfect. He never believes in the boy's innocence. He is one artifice laid on top of another. He lies to his friend about a judgeship knowing the confidence will be shared with the woman he is toying with. His entire behavior in chambers and the house is an act. The last scene which is superficially lovely is actually an escalation of the artifice.Northam pulls this off well. He lets us know at root he is Northam the actor, playing Mamet's lord, who is an elaboration of the original play's character, who in turn represented a very real person. But because that person was a Victorian, he himself was false. As with Vanya, the point of the play is to allow the actor to weave in and out of these layers. Northam is perfect, I say again.One cannot get so excited about the female foil. When will directors ever learn not to direct the people they sleep with? She smiles well.

Court scenes are almost nonexistent; what we do see are preparations and aftermaths in the Winslow household, and the fallout of the case on the family's welfare. For every character, there is something more at work than the pursuit of truth. Is Arthur Winslow motivated by paternal devotion and sense of justice or merely by pride? Does Sir Robert care about the case, or he just fancies Ronnie's spirited sister Catherine (Rebecca Pidgeon)? Catherine herself, the idealist, at one point appears ready to drop everything to save her imminent marriage with a conservative officer; the mother (Gemma Jones) worries about their waning wealth; the other son (Matthew Pidgeon), forced to abandon his studies, becomes eager to join the impending conflict and will probably end up on the trenches of WWI a few years later.Even sneakier, is Ronnie truly innocent? The movie seemingly implies he is, but leaves a trail of breadcrumbs leading in the opposite direction as well.

But gradually, you see Mamet is not subverting the form, like he did in HOMICIDE, but rather playing against it, so it's not hyped and obvious(like another Rattigan adaptation, SEPARATE TABLES, was).  Nigel Hawthorne, Rebecca Pidgeon, Gemma Jones, and Jeremy Northam do reveal themselves, they just choose to do so in subtle terms. And like many, I found the jousting between Northam and Pidgeon the most interesting part of the film.Another review suggests Mike Figgis made a more fluid Rattigan adaptation with THE BROWNING VERSION, and Mamet is not a good filmmaker.  It is true this movie is more stage-bound than the Figgis film(except for the use of headlines), but I found it worked for this film.  Again, while it isn't Mamet's best, I still enjoyed it.

However when the military court of appeal rejects him he has to appeal to the highest court in the land through MP Sir Morton.A turn of the century English drama may not be the subject you'd expect Mamet to tackle but here he does and he brings his usual skill for writing with him.  The characters are very well developed and manage to be very easy to get to know even with the very polite and guarded dialogue.  The characters and dialogue need to be good because much of the drama takes place in stilted conversations or off-screen.  The plot managed to keep me fascinated throughout due to the strong original story and the good writing.  Sadly the film loses something by keeping the main drama off screen (the court cases etc) and this can be quite annoying and slightly sullies the water.The talented cast has plenty to work with and do very well indeed.  Hawthorne revels in this type of role and does the gradual decline very well.  Northam, Pidgeon, Jones etc do well &#150; all manage to deliver very Merchant-Ivory style performances without having the cold edge that those films tend to have.  This is partly Mamet's writing and direction but also the talents of a good cast.Overall this is not typical Mamet fare and many of his fans may struggle with the sheer Englishness of it, but those not put off will find that the characters and dialogue are as strong as ever and the story is gripping even if the off-screen action sometimes appears to be more interesting that what we are allowed to see.

Nigel Hawthorne as patriarch of the Winslow family is in sparkling form, and is ably assisted by an excellent ensemble cast. Particular attention must be given to Jeremy Northam's Sir Robert Morton who works tirelessly to persue the case of the wronged Ronnie Winslow (nicely played by Guy Edwards). He does have ulterior motives of course, even if they go unrequited. Nicely paced The Winslow Boy concentrates more on the effect the case has on the family members rather than on a court-room based drama.

Why did the boy's father go on with the case, despite its devastating effect on his health and finances, his family and reputation?

I advised him to continue making movies that are for the whole family, but with an appeal for adults.  Well He did it! This is the first G rated film, intended for an adult audience, that I remember in years.At the onset, Ronnie Winslow (The Winslow boy) has been expelled from a prestigious English Naval prep school.  When Ronnie tells his father Arthur Winslow (Nigel Hawthorne) that he was innocent of any wrongdoing, Arthur begins a fight to restore his son's name.The film is not a courtroom drama; it is more of an examination of characters that choose to make great personal sacrifices for a beloved. Interestingly the film opens with the family coming home from Sunday services.  As they enter their house they chat about the scripture reading of the day.  The reading happens to be from Gen. 4118 about Joseph's interpretation of Pharaoh's dream.  In pharaoh's dream the seven lean cows eat the seven fat cows, foreshadowing the coming meager years in their own household.The story mainly focuses on three characters, Arthur Winslow, his daughter Catherine (Rebecca Pidgeon, who also had a leading role in the Spanish Prisoner and is the directors wife), and the family attorney Sir Robert Morton (played by the handsome Jeremy Northam).  Catherine is a liberated but temperate suffragette.  Sir Robert is the cool and apparently passionless, self-interested lawyer who is opposed to feminism.  The most fun scenes are when these two are juxtaposed.  A little Pride and Prejudice without the pride.  Once again we see the age-old dichotomy between the logical man and the intuition of a women; I never tire of it.The film's premise is that justice and truth are worth sacrificing for. God the Father's Son was unjustly accused and was made to pay even while he was innocent.  So to, we see this earthly father watch his son unjustly accused. Conversely, just as with Isaac and Abraham, our Father in heaven is often more gentle with us than He is even with His own Son.Keep in mind while you watch the film that there are certain devices that David Mamet uses that give the film his signature; devices that make the films Mametesque, if you will.  The first thing to look for is how the characters will often rephrase their statements; they rephrase their statements.  Get it.  Another device he uses is omission.  Characters may be talking to one another and you are listening just fine until they walk behind a wall and then you don't hear them any more.  The thing omitted is always something seemingly important that you really wanted to know. Sometimes you find out later in the story and sometimes you don't.  If it's important to understanding the characters you will find out, but if it is nonessential to the plot, i.e. how much money the process is going to make, you won't find out.I highly recommend this film.  My three and five year olds fell asleep. My eight and ten year olds enjoyed the film and I think they learned a lesson about telling the truth.

I may be the only one who thinks so but I believe the director has the beginnings of a comedy here. I'll explain later.Poor young Winslow, the great hope of a proud upper middle class family, has been sacked at Osbourne.  His crime?  Nothing as base as say dropping his aye-chez.  No, he's alleged to have stolen and forged a five pound postal money order in a fellow cadet's name.  Enter Arthur, the proud father of this prodigy.  This is a low blow to the Winslow Honor. Arthur shall fight this calumny if it means the family fortune.  Nigel Hawthorne shows us the highs and lows of  Winslow family pride, as Arthur, supported ably by Gemma Jones as his wife, Grace. Ronnie Winslow, his black sheep brother Dickie and the older Winslows then step mostly offstage.  Young Ronnie is later seen being interrupted in the midst of a tennis game, having happily and readily adapted to a new school.The family is teetering on the brink of insolvency. The action has shifted to the two characters I believe are really the focus of the film Superbarrister Sir Robert Morton and Arthur's headstrong daughter Catherine Winslow.  Ms. Winslow wears interesting sunglasses and her manner is brusque and unfeminine.  Sir Robert is smitten instantly if you can grasp almost invisible movie subtext.  The romance seems doomed at the couple's first meeting.  Ms. Winslow remembers Sir Robert's earlier tiff with a suffragist group she supports.  She believes that Sir Robert may not be able to save the family name.  Sir Robert is taken aback- and I say, delighted- to be so grandly challenged from such an interesting quarter. It is cut and thrust between this unlikely pair for the rest of the film. Neither Sir Robert nor Catherine gives an inch.An enormous and expensive public relations and advertising campaign is mounted to exonerate Young Winslow. Though the period of the film seems to be just before World War 1, the newspaper headlines and ad tactics appear similar to those employed today.  Even the bloody Kaiser is evoked as a symbol of evil in the battle to prove the boy's innocence.Mr and Mrs. Winslow are apparently too sensitive to appear in Court or stand in the gallery at Commons as Sir Robert conjures political business on poor Ronnie's behalf. Ms. Winslow does this instead. She brings news, bad or good, back to the Winslows at home.  Meanwhile, the belt must be tightened, the purse grows lighter.  Cheaper rations must suffice, the maid may be let go.  Never mind. The great question is whether Sir Robert is making headway with Ms. Winslow. Does he know what he is doing? It is a very long way to first base here.There is a sharp interrogation sequence in which Sir Robert questions Ronnie closely.  Young Winslow makes mistakes that dismay his family in answering Sir Robert.  Thats alright, the innocence of these mistakes has convinced Sir Robert the boy has been wrongly charged.There is bad news and good news as the campaign ebbs and flows. The privations at home contrast with successes in court and commons.  Ms. Winslow's assessment of the barrister has changed not a whit. Sir Robert is confident.  Ms. Winslow is unconvinced.  The audience has no idea where this is going.  It is particularly difficult to read Catherine. She simply has no screen subtext.  Some critics say actress Rebecca Pidgeon is not playing the part correctly.  They believe Mamet's girlfriend is giving a bad performance here.  She is not.  It is for Sir Robert, played by the intelligent Jeremy Northam, to provide all the character shading necessary to untangle this web.  He isn't interrogating a witness, he is watching Ms. Winslow's reaction to the witness, perhaps not necessarily with a view toward winning, but to simply get to the bottom of Catherine. Exonerating poor Ronnie is not  Sir Robert's goal, its winning  Sis over that matters.  Except you can't quite be sure this is true until the film pays off; Not with just a single surprise, but two of them.  There's a comedy brewing here but Mamet/Rattigan- I'm not sure who is the author of what here- never let any scene quite reach the level of comedy.  You have to watch the interplay between Sir Robert's smirk and Ms. Winslow's drollery awhile, before you know it is not the verdict that interests, but whether they'll get on.

As a portrait of social history, we are amused at the restraint and civility of all, at a time when people subscribed to convention and no one actually said anything directly but intimated through verbal exchanges. Feelings were carefully hidden behind words and true emotions were expressed in code.The highlight of the film has got to be the bantering between the key players the head of the household (Nigel Hawthorne), the barrister engaged to defend the boy (Jeremy Northam) and the sister of the boy (Rebecca Pidgeon).

Pidgeon does well with her character but the aloofness of the character made it difficult for us to empathize with her.We live in an age where permissiveness is the order of the day; when not expressing your true feelings is called repression; where the media encourages individuals to reverberate their personal conflicts through the air waves.

It's interesting the way different members of the audience will probably have different views on what the main point of the movie was. Was it the actual theft of the money and whether young Ronnie Winslow is guilty or not? Was it Arthur Winslow's (brilliantly played by Nigel Hawthorne) obsessive and personalized fight to clear his son's name? Or was it Catherine Winslow (perhaps Rebecca Pidgeon's best performance) and her various romantic possibilities and how they affect her involvement in the case? People who choose the theft itself may be the ones disappointed in the movie since it's interest in the theft pretty much corresponds with Ronnie's. Halfway through he's moved on happily to another school and has practically forgotten about it.This is not one of the more immediately exciting dramas you'll see. There are no fireworks; all the characters are proper and restrained. But David Mamet films everything in a way which made me feel like I was another member of the Winslow household. A shy member who doesn't speak up and just observes the goings-on. ***1/2 out of **** "},{"Title":"Subtle, powerfully acted film about love , honor and moral choices.","Date":"21 June 1999","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  This film will disappoint those looking for an action thriller. Instead , The Winslow Boy finds its thrills and its action within the minds and hearts of its characters. Mamet, accomplishing a feat reminiscent of Scorsese's the Age of Innocence, creates an adult film without sex or violence. Also like Scorsese, he fashions a film which remains true to his abiding concerns while ostensibly dealing with a theme and a period that is alien to his sensiblity. Mamet tells his story and develops his characters with a subtlety and richness that Merchant Ivory and their ilk ( please, let no-one mention the ludicrous Anthony Minghella!) can only envy. Nigel Hawthorne(who should have gotten an Oscar for The Madness of King George,) and Jeremy Northam ( one of the few good things about the over-rated Amistead), give Oscar-worthy performances. The scene where Hawthorne asks his son if he stole the note, and the scene when David Norton  cross examines Ronnie, are among the most powerful ever put on the screen. The final exchange between the Winslow daughter and Morton is genuinely funny-and genuinely sexy. In fact , I will go so far as to predict that it will be a contender at Oscar time.

You can. Can you make a mystery whodunit without a cliched flashback sequence showing us what REALLY happened? You can, and David Mamet has done it.  This brilliantly gentle movie is a true work of genius.  I am not familiar with the play on which it is based, nor of the other 3 previous filmed versions, so I cannot tell how much of the brilliance is already in the words and actions of the actors on stage.  However, this movie pleased and delighted me beyond my expectations.If you told me that David Mamet were to make a film without any four-letter words, and that would be rated G, I would tell you you're crazy.  Yet he's done it.  For once he allows looks and glances to speak volumes instead of the usual foul language that overfilled his previous films to the point of satire.Nigel Hawthorne is wonderful as always as the father of The Winslow Boy, who makes it his life's concern to clear his son's name of stealing and forgery after the lad is expelled from school.  But Jeremy Northam is the surprising standout as the lawyer who takes the case.  The scene where he grills the young boy about what really happened is Oscar-calibre.

His ear for dialogue and eye for human weakness have always fascinated me.  And though his films may seem rather different--he's written the elegant The Spanish Prisoner as well as the action/adventure The Edge--all of them are about characters who play everything close to the vest; their dialogue always hides their true motivations and intentions.So it is really no surprise that Mamet chose to adapt Terence Rattigan's play The Winslow Boy.  It too is about characters who shroud their feelings and beliefs.  But where this deviates from his previous works is that all, or at least most, of the characters are aware of the deception. Some of the scenes between Rebecca Pidgeon and Jeremy Northam are spoken almost in code.  It's really quite amazing.This is certainly David Mamet's finest piece to date, and he has become a truly excellent director.  The acting is first rate, especially Jeremy Northam as famous barrister Sir Robert Morton.  And Mamet's writing presence is felt throughout, as he no doubt altered some of the dialogue to suit his patented rapid-fire exchanges.In a time when most of the movies out are special effects monstrosities that feel empty and lack any sense of humanity  (though I admit that I really liked The Mummy), it is refreshing to find a film that is so vibrantly alive.

While the performances are all good, I found the boy's character to be less compelling than the rest of the cast; this problem is compounded by the fact that is is hardly on the screen at all during the second half of the film, which gives us even less opportunity to connect with him.But the biggest (dramatically speaking) problem I had with the film is that the major plot point--the courtroom scenes and the ultimate legal decision--is played totally off screen!  It seemed as though, rather than dramatizing the story of The Winslow Boy, Mamet decided at some point to instead angle for the romantic interest between the lawyer and the Winslow sister, as well as her struggle for women's suffrage.

I am unfamiliar with the play or its several other adaptations so I can't compare, and I'll judge this film based solely on itself. What's unusual with The Winslow Boy is that it's a court movie which hardly spends any time actually in court, concentrating instead on how the case affects the lives of the Winslow family, and in particular the father Arthur (Nigel Hawthorne) and the daughter Catherine (Rebecca Pidgeon). As such the ultimate resolution of the Winslow case is actually of little importance to the movie, like a bit of a side story, something which may be quite off-putting to some viewers who'd perhaps find it boring and/or pointless. All in all, while The Winslow Boy isn't a masterpiece of epic proportions it's a very well-made solid little film who's greatest strength is probably the excellent performances all across the board.

The drama is admittedly light, centring on the impact of a teenage son's expulsion from naval college and the truth or otherwise of this occurrence. Strangely enough, you never get to learn whether the boy was actually guilty or not of his crime - although he gets off, it's never fully resolved and could be attributed to the superior advocacy of his attorney - sadly still a predilection in modern society. However the dramatic content could have been increased with some kind of courtroom climax, or confession, but now I'm arguing with the original play, hardly the fault of David Mamet or his actors. The Edwardian, pre War golden - era is nicely evoked with the big house, coterie of servants and upper - class manners of the family, although contemporary influences such as suffragetism (strongly) and the approaching war (mildly) are referred to. I'm not sure Mamet properly and fully brought home the sensational aspect of the Winslow case on the British public, even as I appreciated his subtlety in demonstrating this via newspaper hoardings, contemporary cartoons and the like. He does however marshall his acting troupe well. Nigel Hawthorne shines as the patriarch who sacrifices the wants and needs of his wider family for the sake of clearing his son's name. I didn't get the impression that it was the family name he was defending and genuinely believe it was for his youngest son's future which concerned him, which is as it should be. I'm not quite sure however that Hawthorne seems just too old to have fathered the boy. The rest of the cast play very well although some of their roles seem stereotypical and perhaps more could have been made of the interfamily tensions...but again that takes us back to Rattigan's source material. Mamet this time, quite rightly eschews all opportunity to contemporise the play and his cinematic devices are subtly reined in, no overlapping dialogue or sharp cross-cutting here. I liked the utilisation of the swinging garden gate at the start of the film, letting in the bad from outside, which recalled to mind J.B. Priestley's An Inspector Calls. How often English dramatists seemed to write about the so called idyllic society of the upper classes breaking down...nothing lasts forever it seems. Anyway, in summary, a wordy piece, well shot, well played but ultimately probably best enjoyed as a stage play.

Thirteen year old Ronnie is accused of being dishonest and scrubbed from an elite boys school operated by the British Navy. His family is quick to defend his right to a trial, etc., although, oddly and unfortunately, the boy, so central to the plot, has little say in all the events that happen to him or the political and legal battles fought for him.

I thought the old version with Robert Donat was excellent and couldn't be topped, but I am exceedingly happy to be proven wrong here by, in my opinion, Mamet's best cinematic achievement to date.  In THE WINSLOW BOY, Mamet benefits from an impeccable cast, especially the great Nigel Hawthorne (one of the best actors working either on stage or screen presently) and Gemma Jones as Mr. and Mrs. Arthur & Grace Winslow, both of whom give tremendously layered and moving performances.The story, nominally about honour and right prevailing over all adversity, is made into a complex story of moral ambiguity, a territory Mamet knows very well. Jeremy Northam proves himself to be a rising star as the mercurial barrister who Arthur hires to defend his son, whom he believes to have been falsely accused of theft. With a voice inflection or an elevation of an eyebrow, Northam transforms Sir Richard Morton from a cold theologian to an amused cynic to a sexy potential lover. The sly double-entendre between Northam and Rebecca Pidgeon's Catherine Winslow is so deliciously done that I was reminded of the famous horse race talk between Bogart and Bacall in BIG SLEEP. I initially had some problem with Rebecca Pidgeon as a dramatic actress, but even she fares well, probably because Catherine Winslow is such an engaging character (sort of reminded me of Elizabeth Bennett in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE).Interestingly, Mamet eschews putting in dramatic court scenes and instead focuses on the effects of prolonged trial on the Winslow family. A wise move indeed, if the reaction of the audience at the screening is anything to judge by. I haven't seen a movie theater audience bursting spontaneously into applause in a long, long time.

The beauty of this piece is, of course, the dialogue.  Not so much for what is said, which is mostly irrelevant, but for what is not said and for how it is said.  This is the key to following the movie and empathizing with the characters.

He was turned off by the tendency of the Brits to restrain the showing of emotion.  Another commenter here said the same thing.  To me the other side of the coin is more important.  I am not sick and tired of period pieces of old England.  They have a lot to teach us.  Just because they don't wear their hearts on their sleeves, does not mean they are cold and distant. There is an element of powerful subtlety that most Americans don't understand and don't relate to.  In comparison to these principled adults, we are a wild and crazy bunch, addicted to consumerism and the bottom line. And our teenagers are seriously testing limits, to the point of mass killings of their classmates.  I pick restraint to melodrama and hysteria. Too bad Americans turn toward gratuitous sex and violence.  In this movie, the plot, acting, costumes, set, photography, direction are all of the highest order.  Viewers need to be sensitive to nuances and subtlety to enjoy this great film.The film is based on a play which was based on a true happening, in which a historic, landmark decision was made in England, on the basis of examining the question of fairness when a young boy was dismissed from a military school for thievery and forgery.  He said he was not guilty, but no one would believe him.  The case hit the headlines and there was a dramatic turning point. "},{"Title":"Let Right Be Done","Date":"10 June 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  The Winslow Boy is a wonderfully acted film about British civility. Taken from the play by Terrence Rattigan and placed in the hands of the craftsman, David Mamet, this film evokes a time in British history when manners was everything, even to the point of denying a person their heart's desires. This is why the play was such a success in England when people craved for a justification for acting the way they did, betraying their own selves just so they could act proper and decent.  But don't take The Winslow Boy as just another The Remains of the Day.   While that aspect of characters sublimating their powerful passions is common to both films, The Winslow Boy chooses to balance despair with hope and certain defeat with undeniable victory.  Here are the particulars.  A well to-do family, the Winslows, does something no one has dared before.  Because the young master, Ronnie, has been expelled from Admiralty School for allegedly stealing and cashing a postal order, the family chooses to appeal by bringing a court case against the British government.  In order to do that, it must first ask Parliament for the very right to sue. That's call civility but civility also means one must never side with the mighty against the weak.   The case becomes a cause celebre to the point of preoccupying the government's time while other matters like that nasty thing in the Balkans is brewing.  The Winslow Boy is intentionally without much dramatics.  There is no musical score to speak of , the subtle intentions of the characters can be missed if you don't pay attention to the dialogue (a heavy hearted suitor tells his love that he will write down his proposal in a letter for her to think about even as they converse without ever mentioning to marry), and the most dramatic moment of this film takes place, not in a courtroom, but in the gentle foyer of a much comforting home, where even the triumph of the moment registers little more than a smile of relief.  Mamet does all he can to make us live the British mannerly life and he uses the slow pace of this film to illustrate the enormity of time that must be spent to fight the government.  It is that aspect of the film that might turn some people off for even though it is just under two hours, you feel you have been watching a lot longer. The flavor and mood of  The Winslow Boy is captured very early when Arthur Winslow informs his older son, Dickie,  in a less than amicable exchange that he doesn't approve of his son's romancing in their house, kissing and dancing in plain view with the music of the gramophone blaring away.  It is a powerful reminder that in this household, in this proper society, you do not wear your heart on your sleeve.  Further on, the trusted solicitor and family friend, Desmond, learns of the news from the house servant that Kate Winslow, the daughter, is about to be wedded to a military officer.  He is particularly peeved because he has always loved Kate and would have wanted to hear this news from her but his anger is controlled because he is, frankly, civil.  The highly touted lawyer, Sir Robert Morton, is hired to defend the schoolboy Ronnie but when he and Kate are together, there is a certain twinkle in their eyes for a longing neither one is willing to act out.  Kate learns Morton has refused a high political offer in order to defend the case and tries mightily to tell Morton of her admiration and (read between the lines) love for such a sacrifice.  She does it clumsily and Morton adds insult by blowing off her attempt.  Not the kind of thing you expect in courtship.  Mamet emphasizes two characters who have to struggle with their own integrity.  The father Arthur literally gives up all his wealth to fight the government.  It is a wonderful study of a man full of power and dignity at the beginning and one reduced to looking feeble and incoherent, ready for the nursing home, at the end.  The second character study is Kate, who willingly gives up her life for woman's suffrage, to the point of not seeing the forest from the trees. Even as she is engaged to marry, she carries around a book titled 'Social Evil and Social Good' while her father admonishes her for not reading Lord Byron.  Even as life around her is crumbling, she foregoes everything for a cause, finally swallowing her pride to request a small salary in order to help her family.  The Winslow Boy is  well acted with a wonderful ensemble starting with Nigel Hawthorne's Arthur to Rebecca Pidgeon as Kate to Jeremy Northam as Morton. You leave the theater thinking about a time when people acted according to convention and not to their heart.   Now we live in a different age, an age of getting everything we can when we can get it, never mind who gets in our way.  Maybe things really were better back then.

He has expressed this through subjecting his audience to tedious repetition, forcing us therefore to study the differences between the similar.  He has illustrated the nuances of the con, making the unimportant into the superbly important.  Sometimes it works, other times it does not.  For some people it works, for others it does not. But now Mamet has finally achieved what is inarguably his finest directorial effort to date.  He unfolds his story delicately, but with such acute insight (he wrote the screenplay) so as to have no point become belabored. His dialogue is swift and efficient, as is his trademark, though without the bluster and profanity many have mistakenly come to expect.

Jeremy Northam (Mr. Knightly in Emma) is a highly successful barrister who agrees to take on a case involving the young son of Nigel Hawthorne (The Madness of King George).  The boy has been expelled from school for allegedly stealing a money order.  Rebecca Pidgeon (Mamet's wife in real life) plays Hawthorne's 30-year-old, about-to-be-married, suffragette, daughter.As it is adapted from a play, most of the scenes take place indoors, and the sets and costumes are spot-on.  Although it concerns a legal action, there are no traditional courtroom scenes.  The script is intelligently written and well performed.  The actors recite their lines in typical Mamet style--direct, almost flat, but strangely explosive.  The emotions are tightly restrained but only just below the surface and all the more focused because of it.  Although it is a drama, it has enough satire and humor so that it never bogs down.If you live in a two-bit town you might have to wait a week or two before this movie reaches you, as it is in limited release.

In fact, Mamet -- who it was once fashionable to dismiss as a misogynist -- has made his first woman's movie, and a feminist one at that. (No, it's not TITANIC.) At first glance, there would seem little to distinguish it from a dry, little BBC production.  But small and dry is just how Mamet likes it, the stiff manners of Victorian England a perfect venue for his controlled dialogue.  Language is of course what Mamet is all about and Rattigan's play on a petty-theft trial that became media sensation in Edwardian England, conjures a time when language was the both the finest virtue, and instrument of sexual repression.  Words are whispered and obscured by sudden walls.  Letters are hidden and read silently alone. Words damn and redeem, leaving the audience to guess just how strongly the characters actually believe in their pursuit of petty justice.  Don't expect a riveting court-room drama though, unfortunately Mamet doesn't expand much beyond the walls of the Father Winslow's study -- rather, off-screen events are conveyed by news-boys, maids and other stand-ins for Greek chorus.  Mamet was attracted to this convention as it followed the antique rule of `don't show the unshowable.'  REBECCA PIGEON shines in the role of Kate Winslow, the suffragette who wants to, and could be, a lawyer. Here she walks about icily sexy (occasionally sporting the same sunglasses she wore in THE SPANISH PRISONER), her wooden intonations ever contrasting with her deeply expressive face and sly manner.  (Seeing her in person, I dare say, it seems like Mamet is frumping her up a bit for the camera, I suppose for reality's sake, because in person, she's supernaturally beautiful.  There're some great bits on smoking cigarettes, which doubles as sex between her and JEREMY NORTHAM who plays Sir Robert, the arrogant lawyer who takes on the case for publicity, then justice and possibly love. Ultimately, the movie is a handsome, satisfying, if low-key, plea for siding with the common over the great and letting right be done, but if you found the Spanish Prisoner boring, I would steer clear.  I didn't talk to a single woman who didn't like this movie, though. When asked why this radical departure, Mamet replied, how so? and then quoted Major Pat Buckly's most important thing he ever learned, While life is mostly froth and bubble, two things stand in stone; kindness, mostly trouble; courage and your own.

He has adapted it from the 50 year old Terence Rattigan play which is a legal drama without a courtroom scene. Jeremy Northam stars as an attorney (barrister) in early 20th century England who has been retained to clear the name of a young boy who has been accused of theft and forgery and summarily dismissed from military school. His father (Nigel Hawthorne) and sister (Rebecca Pidgeon) crusade to bring this case to court with aid of Northam. In the process they effect the lives of everyone in their lower middle class family. Their family has their 15 minutes fame. Was it all really worth it? It was the O.J. case of its day. Almost the entire film is set in the Winslow family home. The courtroom drama takes place off-screen and we are privy only to the repercussions of the case on the family. Performances are excellent. Hawthorne and Gemma Jones (Mrs. Winslow) beautifully mirror the mores and customs of the times. Emotion is rarely outwardly shown. However, it is right there simmering beneath the surface. Rebecca Pidgeon (Mamet's real life wife) is a suffragette whose engagement is threatened by the notoriety of the case. Mamet has filmed the story in his deliberate stately manor. Even the speech patterns of the principals telegraphs the repressions of that age. The production is quite modest compared with the other English dramas of recent years (Howard's End, Remains of the Day, Emma, Sense & Sensibility). However, the whole is satisfying and you'll leave the theater wishing to see what happens to Northam and Pidgeon after their ultimate scene.

But Arthur Winslow (superbly played by Nigel Hawthorne) isn't angry. Instead, he believes his boy to have been wrongly accused. And so with the help of his suffragette daughter (Catherine) and esteemed attorney Sir Robert Morton, Arthur sets out to clear his son's name.What follows is a beautifully written legal drama. But unlike The Verdict (also written by Mamet), there are no courtroom scenes here. No tense battles between lawyers or nail biting cross examinations, Mamet film revoking the usual legal maneuvers and opting instead to explore a family's determination to retain its dignity.But how can they remain dignified when their case becomes a nationwide news story? How can they remain dignified when their steadfast belief in their son is mocked by journalists and newspapers? How can they remain dignified when the British Parliament argues the case in the House of Lords? How can they remain dignified when the family suffers financial loss, much self-doubt, media scrutiny and even the break-off of Catherine's engagement to a status-sensitive snob (Aden Gillett)?A fine old rumpus, the maid calls it all. And indeed it is. As Arthur's health deteriorates, his steadfast wife demands to know why he's sacrificing the family's well-being. For justice! he says. Are you sure it's not pride and self-importance? she counters.Of course, this being a David Mamet film - all Mamet's films are con games - The Winslow Boy is also a film about misdirection. On the surface, we're asked to wonder whether or not the Winslow Boy is really guilty, whilst below the surface, Mamet works in another layer of misdirection. On this level, every character is lying, every one of them misdirecting the audience by putting on a false facade.In this regard, every character's behaviour is precisely the opposite of their actual beliefs. So the father cares not for his son but rather his own family honour. The Winslow boy is guilty and stands embarrassed out in the rain. The older son is broke, hates his father and shall be shipped off to war, yet he accepts it all with cheerful good faith. Similarly, the maid, who always enters frame when there is talk of no money, is ambivalent to the fact that she will surely be fired soon. Then there's the three way relationship between the hotshot lawyer, the Winslow daughter and her fiancé. Her fiancé pretends to love her, yet leaves as soon as the case gains momentum, whilst she pretends to fight for women's independence (she's a suffragette) despite being entirely dependent on her family/men for her income. Similarly, the hotshot lawyer pretends to take the case because he believes the boy to be innocent, when in fact he's simply after the boy's attractive sister. When he confides to his friend that he has turned down a promotion to take the case, he does so knowing that this news will be confided to her, thus making him seem more appealing in her eyes.The entire film is thus an exercise in misdirection, the film communicating one thing while the truth sits just below the surface. The artifice is all a lie, a slick Edwardian card trick. End result we're so busy looking for clues of the kid's innocence, that we don't realize that the whole family is guilty. 8.5/10 - Worth two viewings.

The story was a compelling account of honor and the fight for what is right no matter what the cost.  Ronnie Winslow (Guy Edwards) is expelled from the Naval College for allegedly stealing and cashing a postal order of seven shillings.  He is resolute in his denial of the deed and his father Arthur Winslow (Nigel Hawthorne) risks everything the family owns to take up the legal battle to clear his son's name.  It was generally an engaging story, although it bogged down in places when it became overly introspective.  Too much time was spent on scenes devoted solely to the cost/benefit of the fight.  Is it worth it? Yes.  But is it really worth it? Yes.  There were at least four such scenes when one would have sufficed.  This is a minor flaw in an otherwise good script.  This story was about a legal fight but oddly had no scenes in court.  It would have benefited by a stirring closing argument by Sir Robert.  However, the suspense of how the family received the news of the verdict was excellent. The direction in this film is superb.  The sets and costumes were wonderfully matched to the period.  The photography was rich and full of complimentary colors.  Mamet was meticulous in subtle details, such as the scene where a hanging piece, as evidenced by its outline, was obviously missing from the wall due to the costly fight for the boy's honor.  Mamet uses the camera well to create impact with extreme close ups, like the close up of the wax seal on the letter from the school and another of a passage from the Bible.He directs the actors adeptly with just the right mix of restrained passion and proper English demeanor typical of early 20th century England.  The dialogue was delivered crisply with rapid fire exchanges, reminiscent of films made in the 40's and 50's, a style that has been all but lost in contemporary films.  The portrayal of the subtle romantic tension between natural antagonists Sir Robert, the staunch conservative and Catherine Winslow, the crusading liberal, was marvelous.   The acting was fabulous.  Jeremy Northam (Sir Robert Morton) had an excellent 1999 with this role and his role of Sir Robert Chiltern in An Ideal Husband.  He seems to be inspired by roles where his name is Sir Robert.Rebecca Pidgeon reunites with Mamet again after The Spanish Prisoner and gives a strong performance of the phlegmatic liberal woman's suffragette who is caught in the maelstrom of her brother's fight.  Her's was a difficult role because her character was a highly passionate crusader compelled to restraint due to the constraints of the etiquette of the times.  She did a good job of portraying a sardonic disdain for such phoniness delivering simple courtesies with obvious contempt.  Yet, she was often a little too deadpan about her own emotions.Nigel Hawthorne gave a fine performance as the patriarch.  He gave a good rendition of a proud and powerful man in decline as age, his infirmities and the legal fight took their toll on him.  Newcomer Guy Edwards was excellent as Ronnie Winslow.  He was the picture of a proper British boy, but when confronted with the postal order, he would stare you right in the eyes, plant his heels and convince you he didn't do it and that he was telling the truth.I gave this film a 9/10.  It is yet another terrific British project that is a must see for the intelligent and refined viewer.

Even more disappointing to me was that Mamet cut some very good scenes and dialogue that provided the perspective of the barrister's reasoning, for why he took the case. The cross-examination of the boy is much more cogent in the 1948 version.

The actors' performances seem to have been captured a rehearsal or two short of a good take, or may be suffering from weak direction. The script is also patchy and pedestrian, suggesting it is fairest to lay the blame at the feet of director/screenplay writer Mamet. Such sterling actors as Nigel Hawthorne and Gemma Jones struggle to make an impression, with only the spirited Rebecca Pidgeon making much of her part. This is until the appearance on the scene of Jeremy Northam as barrister Sir Robert Morton. Northam is powerful in his screen presence and unerring in his delivery down to the smallest touch. His acting range as demonstrated so far may not be huge, but for this reviewer he can do no wrong. The subtly expressed and low key sexual tension between his character and Rebecca Pidgeon's character gives the audience something to be interested in, in this stodgy film. The final few exchanges are classic. Where was the sure touch demonstrated in the last few minutes, for the rest of the film? It's worth it though.

Underlying the main theme of proclaiming this young boy innocent of stealing a minute amount of cash is the superb glance at life in a privileged English household at the turn of the century.  Life definitely happened at a slower pace.  While some may think it moved at a ponderous pace, I am glad I rented the video so I could stop and go back to be certain of their words.  The broken engagement was what one could expect of the upper class at that time.  They were so afraid of being tainted by adverse publicity.  I only hope that Sir Robert's and Catherine's paths crossed at a later date.

The playwright obviously understands his target audience and ingratiates himself to that end by accommodating middle class values and pretensions, mocking them with kid gloves, in order to elicit pathos that seemed unearned and underhanded. In the film version, David Mamet makes no attempt to update the work or conceal its fake premise let right be done excepting the poor and underprivileged with no political clout or monetary means to avail themselves of a prominent lawyer to bail themselves and their ego out of such predicament.  It is unlikely that anyone will overlook the age-old myth that the middle class can have it all.  Give up the prospects of marrying a military officer, who conveniently turns out to be a cad, and hold out for a rich lawyer who can not only restore the family's honor but provide an even better physical match for a dutiful, self-sacrificing daughter and suffragette, and you will walk away with everything in the end.  It is clear that Mamet, like Rattigan, knows precisely who his target audience is and milks it for all it is worth, vanity and all.

This film however did bring Jeremy Northam to my attention who was superb in this and anything I've seen him in, that's why I've given it 7. I thought the woman playing Catherine was rubbish and let the whole production down. She had none of the subtlety or underplayed pathos of Margaret Leighton, they might as well of had a wooden puppet playing the part. Nigel Hawthorne put in a creditable performance. One of the comic highlights of the original is Katherine Harrison's loud, cockney maid. The girl in this film seemed to sleep walk her way through the scenes, which should have made you sit up and at least smile. In fact that just about sums up Mamet's directorial style-somnambulent. If you want to see the definitive version though check out Donat and Co. you even get the screenplay written by the Author!

The plot is as that of countless other courtroom dramas, individuals against the might of state. However, set in pre-war London the drama of the film is almost conceptual, with the characters playing out their lines from behind a veil of propriety. This has its point, made after the denouement concerning the nature of law (Northam's relatively flambouyant law lord Morton warns against the indulging emotion in pursuit of justice/right).I can't see the justification here. Despite the undeniable tension in the narrative that the dialogue builds (I'd imagine it's all very close to the stage play) I keep having to suspend my dismay in what looks like disastrously bad acing in order to keep watching - especially in scenes where there is layered dialogue and the lines tend more toward texture.Out of all of this does come a miraculously balanced performance from Nigel Hawthorne. Whether he's just much better than everyone else (undeniable) or has ignored the injunction to deliver lines divorced from their emotive impetus (possible) he manages to draw in the themes of the serious vs folly, legal machination vs romance, the corruption of state vs the irreducible core of faith and integrity like satellites. It's amazing.The support is able but subordinated - Mamet's (well researched and well dressed) exercise has its use but as an object in itself. 5/10 "},{"Title":"A Masterpiece Neutered and Shrunk","Date":"27 September 2002","Score":"5 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  David Mamet's version of The Winslow Boy quite fails to understand Terence Rattigan's play, from which the film is derived.  The film is glued to a one-dimensional stereotype of pre-World War I English behavior, decorous and emotionally suppressed, which defeats the drama at every turn.  Warning in support of my comments, some facts of the movie's plot are mentioned.  The play, on the contrary, is not a period piece.  It portrays the agony, humiliation, disbelief, indifference, anger, confusion, determination, persistence, idealism, sacrifice, protective love, cynicism, and fear with which a boy's nearest and dearest react to his expulsion from naval cadet school, and the crusade to vindicate him.  Their language may be more refined and their emotional expression more controlled than often occurs, but within these limits the range and conflict are substantial.By combining his stereotype with extensive deletions, Mamet cuts off his characters at the knees, if not higher.  The father's determination and persistence remain, but most of his tendency to dominate and humiliate is gone.  The sister's intelligence, loyalty and tact are there, but not the poignant depth of her love and vulnerability.  We see the mother's protective love, but not the formidable passion of her attack against the crusade.  The original play feeds the intellect by raising questions about the boy's innocence, and about the worth of the crusade in his behalf; contrary opinions are not merely stated, but supported with cogent reasons.  It feeds the soul by raising the banner of doing Right, and by facing the substantial sacrifices along the way.  It feeds the heart by showing the deep and vulnerable love of a father for his son, of a mother for her family, of a daughter for her fiance, of a family friend for the daughter.  All this food is on short ration in Mamet's remake.Rattigan has a fine dramatic sense, which Mamet often spoils.  Watch, for example, what should be the most striking scene of the story, a cross-examination of the Winslow boy in the family parlor. England's best trial lawyer is deciding whether to take the case.  In the original, the questioning starts quietly but builds to an aggressive harshness that has the boy muddled and crying, and the family angry and alarmed.  Whereupon the lawyer, to everyone's surprise, accepts the case, calling the boy plainly innocent.   Mamet doesn't cut the text in this scene, but he does cut way back on the lawyer's aggressiveness and the boy's distress.  The dramatic excitement of the original, based on powerful emotional reversals, is mostly lost in the remake.Within the limits of the Mamet stereotype, Nigel Hawthorne as the father and Jeremy Northam as the lawyer are interesting and pleasant to watch.  The rest of the cast is not memorable.

In the role of Morton this time is Jeremy Northam - something of a film darling after portraying Mr Knightley to Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma - with Nigel Hawthorne as the father of the boy who might or might not have stolen a postal order.Guy Edwards plays Ronnie, the accused boy, effectively, and the story - although slight and somewhat preposterous to modern eyes - continues to engage and involve the viewer as it always did.David Mamet's film of 'The Winslow Boy' did fairly well at the box office and was an intelligent film, sticking to what it did best without resorting to cheap sensationalism or unnecessary updates.

In a nutshell, it was boring and it feature a very annoying lead character in Catherine Winslow (Rebecca Pidgeon). Her feminist agenda was a little too strong to swallow, like Kate Winslet's super-irritating role in The Titanic. It's not a bad film, just not interesting enough and one of those movies that after an hour, you realize you don't care about any of the major characters.One thing I did appreciate the dry humor. In fact, it was refreshingly dry. (I've always appreciate sarcasm, unless it's too strong against by beliefs, of course!) It's also a period costume film, set in the early 1900s, an era I like.One question why wasn't this the courtroom drama it was supposed to be? Instead, we get all this feminist agenda and stupid romance between two idiots. Also, it's supposed to also center around the title - the Winslow boy. Where was he? He took a backseat, far back in this stagy yawner. Mamet's Hannibal, The Spanish Prisoner, and Ronin are all far superior work to this one.

One only needs to contrast her lackluster performance as Catherine in this version of Winslow with Emma Thompson's in the 1988 TV version to realize that a really good British actress in the role would have elevated the whole movie and actually been up to the exemplary work done by Jeremy Northam and Nigel Hawthorne. Too bad.

It took me, and most people by surprise. A intoxicating bouillabaisse of mystery, intrigue, and a healthy selection of solid actors. It was a grand film and made me very excited for what Mamet had next up his sleeve.  The man has been working for years, churning out amazing plays and scripts, but who could have guessed The Winslow Boy would come from this original goodfella. Set in the early 1900's, this period costume film is about as far removed as a Mamet movie can get.  My hatred for all things tea and cakes is widely known, I was hoping Mamet would turn this awful genre of films on it's head.  I was wrong, dead wrong.  What we have in front of us is the same old jokes about late tea service and brown shoes! and the typical but it's about our times too! message of justice and decency.  We've seen it all before (and better, you listening Emma Thompson?). When the movie concentrates on the trial of the young boy, the film is seamless. But the rest of the movie concerns itself with unrequited love and the effects of aging. It's all extra fat and the picture suffers for it. What the film excels at is the basic production values that these film always do perfectly.  It's a handsome movie with a lot of good actors and writing to support it.  I admire how rapid the dialog is fired.  With the pace of a turtle, all the good sours to bad quickly.  And how am I going to get excited about restraint?  Mamet will recover from this lethargic film, we all know it.  I don't think that I missed the point of the film.  I just don't like a movie that cannot get excited about itself. ------------- 4  "},{"Title":"Utterly Disapointing","Date":"3 December 2003","Score":"0 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  I have seen pretty much all of David Mamet's films over the years and he has quickly climbed the charts on my board for one of the best Directors and Screenwriters out there.
