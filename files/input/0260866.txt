[{"Title":"Ve Haff Vays of MAKING You Talk...","Date":"8 October 2001","Score":"53 out of 64 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  They say there's nothing new under the sun, and that's especially apt in sunny Hollywood.  So it's tempting to ask, merely as a theoretical exercise, can you make a movie that is essentially a model kit assembled from other movies, and still make it effective?  Don't Say a Word proves that the answer is Yes.  WHY you would want to set out to do such a thing is another question; you'll have to ask the producers about it.In the movie, Michael Douglas plays an affluent, happily married psychologist who has to contend (as Michael Douglas does in every movie), with a seriously disturbed woman.  The femme-looney in this outing is Elizabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy), a 10-year, 20-institution veteran with enough contradictory diagnoses to sink a DSM textbook.  He is called in to consult by a colleague (Oliver Platt) and then is bewildered as a shadowy band of Bad Guys snatch his daughter and demand that he work his famed empathy thing with poor Britt and get her to give him a ten-digit number that they need.  Her dad, it seems, ripped them off during the heist of a precious red jewel, and they need the number to find it.  Douglas figures out that while she has problems of her own, Elizabeth has been confounding her doctors by imitating various symptoms, in effect, staying institutionalized to hide from the evildoers.  Me, I would have gone to Tahiti; to each his own.The kidnap-flick tropes then come in fast and heavy the Panicked Discovery, the Initial Phone Call, The List of Rules (no cops, yada yada), No Deal Til I Talk to My Daughter, the Desperate Clock-Race Across Town, the Tough Female Detective trying to Figure It All Out, and more.  We get a host of other familiar faces, too the Bad Guys are a band of high-tech thieves (which are so common in movies, they must have a hell of a union), with black leather jackets, sleek laptops, and a guy whose job during the robbery is to stand in the middle of the bank with a stopwatch calling off the time, as though they were at the Olympic trials for the 100-meter Felony.But all this is skillfully handled, with just enough tweaks to the familiar formulas to make it feel fresh.  At one point, Douglas makes the kidnappers relocate to meet him, a nice twist on the usual kidnappers run the bagman all over town scene.  And the bit with the mental patient, well, it beats can-we-raise-the-money-in-time?  For his part, Michael Douglas does well, though he is a little too slick to portray besieged decent men.  My hunch is that Harrison Ford was first choice to play this role.  Famke Janssen is good as his wife.  Though the script gives her little to do, she is really the one who makes us feel the panic and despair that attend the abduction of a child, and though it's a familiar movie scenario, it is still able to play on the nerves quite effectively.  The little girl playing Douglas' daughter does well, too, cute but not cloying, smart but credible; there is an amusing scene where she attempts to make conversation with the hulking, tattooed murderer who is guarding her, eventually cajoling him into making peanut-butter and jelly sandwiches.  And, carrying on the proud tradition started by Alyssa Milano in Commando, does her level best to foil her captors.The Bad Guys are a little disappointing.  They are assigned quirks rather than characters (one never appears to have a name).  As the head villain, Sean Bean makes what he can of his feral charisma, but he literally phones this performance in.  I think the poor guy is doomed to spend the rest of his career playing Hibernian heavies in leather jackets.  Their operation seems a little too well-orchestrated, especially since the movie supposedly take place less than three weeks after they've been sprung after doing a dime in Attica (where one guesses they studied electronic eavesdropping in between lifting weights).  And while the movie doesn't say how much the priceless rock is worth, by my estimation, after splitting the proceeds and covering their overhead, surveillance equipment, and tattoos, the gang should have just enough left for a celebratory lunch at the IHOP.The best performance is by Brittany Murphy as the twitchy, wary Elizabeth. With her weird hand gestures and tuneless singing, this character could have been really annoying.  But Murphy makes her guileless and affecting. Watching her stare out her barred window at the tugboats in the river, your heart breaks just a little.The story is not always credible, especially the parts involving Jennifer Esposito as the detective, who is really a sideshow anyway.  We also see several New Yorkers who are surprisingly pliant when deprived of everything from cell phones to speedboats.  And the parents adhere blindly to the don't tell the cops rule, even after it is laughably impractical to do so.The thing that really makes the movie work is the setting and the way it is shot by director Gary Fleder, who made the underrated Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead.  Fleder puts us in claustophobic, oppressive places, from underground morgues to puke-green institution hallways with prison doors and disturbing graffiti, to the fog-shrouded darkness of Potter's Field, graveyard of the anonymous dead of New York City.  Even Douglas' luxury apartment seems at tight quarters, and these places are filmed in such a way to make this close to a horror movie.  The dark climax is formulaic, but give a neat twist in location.  The number, incidentally, doesn't refer to an uplink code or satellite designation or encryption key or any of the usual millenial McGuffins of late.  What it represents is something surprising, sad, and refreshingly old-fashioned.  Which kind of goes for the rest of the movie as well.

That's pretty much what we're dealing with here. Even if you haven't seen this movie yet, you have.With Don't Say a Word, it's like whoever made it was so enthralled by the high-concept, give-it-to-me-in-ten-words-or-less premise, they figured they didn't have to try real hard with anything else. Sure, it's competent. But with its intriguing premise, it should have advanced way past that.Oh well. It doesn't. Michael Douglas -- who in this film is wearing more make-up than the women I see on Santa Monica Blvd. at midnight -- puts in the kind of performance that, if this were an office job, wouldn't get him fired but wouldn't get him promoted. It's more than a drive-by paycheck pick-up, but Douglas has been around long enough to size up a script and know when he should bother trying and when he shouldn't. He goes with choice B here. And it doesn't really matter.(As a side note, when is the last time Michael Douglas had an on-screen wife within 20 years of his own age? I mean, come on. Do you really think that in real life the man could...oh, wait, never mind.)As for everything else, Brittany Murphy scores some points for playing a schizophrenic disaster of a girl who you'd still like to nail. Oliver Platt, who is getting fatter faster than Aretha Franklin, shows up for some day player-level acting work. Famke Jannsen looks sexy in a cast, but isn't given much to do. And as for the cop, played by Jennifer Esposito, she is so irrelevant to the plot that she's practically in a different movie altogether.The plot? If you can't figure out how this movie ends, you're trying even less than whoever wrote it.Having said all that, it will still kill two free hours just fine. Little ventured, nothing gained.

I can't quite agree with that, but the level of intensity and the fast moving plot really impressed me, even if it all didn't quite add up in the end.  I can't remember a movie that I've seen in awhile that just MOVED along so well and had so little downtime. Given the 'deadline', it felt like it was in real-time for the second half of the movie. I was a little bothered by Michael Douglas having a wife the age of Famke.  I love her and its not a knock against her but there was no need to keep up Douglas' legacy of attracting wives under 35 for him.  Gwyneth Paltrow, Demi Moore and Daryl Hannah have all been love interests for him - why?  Because its the male fantasy?  Reeks of insecurity to me.  Plus I don't see Dame Judi Dench romancing Leo, do I?  Meryl Streep and James Franco?  Anyway, this is not important, just slightly annoying.  There are questions I'd like to ask the screenwriter because there are inconsistencies along the way and about one or two things that are totally out of the question.  However, as I mentioned, the movie moves along so fast that you might not have time to dwell on anything for too long. I don't think it was speeded up to cover anything up either.  The best part is the acting, especially by Brittany Murphy.  I didn't enjoy her in Clueless but really loved her in Girl Interupted and thought she was the best thing about that movie.  Here she gives it all, in a part that could have been laughed off the screen if it weren't played exactly right.  Jennifer Esposito is also very believable as a cop, Sean Bean as a kidnapper and, as mentioned, Famke as a trophy wife.  Worth watching, for sure.  7/10.

The trailers I had seen for it had me thinking it was going to be kind of cheesy for lack of a better word, but this was actually very engrossing. It had an interesting story line, sustained suspense and for the most part was well acted.I particularly liked Brittany Murphy as Elisabeth Burrows, the psychiatric inmate whose tortured mind holds the information that Dr. Conrad (Michael Douglas) needs to get in order to save his young daughter Jessie's (Skye McCole Bartusiak) life. Murphy seemed so into her character that it was almost spooky to watch her. She was extremely convincing. Douglas I thought also offered up a good performance, as did Sean Bean as Patrick, the head kidnapper. Young Miss Bartusiak was commendable but to me didn't seem to portray the range of emotions I would expect a young child to be feeling in Jesse's circumstances. She just seemed altogether too calm. The same could be said for Famke Janssen as Jessie's mother Aggie Conrad. I realize the character had a broken leg and apparently couldn't get out of bed, but again she just seemed to take the whole thing too calmly (and, when her own life was threatened she seemed able to move around well enough, broken leg or not!) As for Oliver Platt as Conrad's colleague Dr. Sachs? I find that, depending on the movie, I either like Platt or don't (no middle ground) and I didn't care for him in this movie.Overall, though, the movie was quite good as a vehicle for Douglas. I'd rate it as a 7/10.

Why does these hollywood movies all end up with the guy/gal who never raised a fist suddenly becomes the fighting Rambo figure, while these career criminals becomes so dumb and careless, all at the same time.  Anytime you think to yourself why doesn't the criminal kill or subdue their victims on a certain situation, then you know these dumb acts by them were written in so that the heroine could escape from their grasp.Situations like when the mom found out they got their daughter in same apt one floor away, why did the whole gang run off and send one guy to finish her unsupervised?  Could they have not have easily monitored her through the video system while sending two guys instead?  What was the big rush?  They had the whole surveillance setup only to abandon it when discovered by someone whom couldn't have done anything anyway.  There are many other scenes where people make illogical decisions.For a desperate doctor in a mental hospital, he sure skipped out on alot of the options available at his disposal like hypnosis or sodium pentothal.All in all, a really bad film that make you cringe, not for the suspense, but for all the situations where you would say why didn't they just, why would they do that or this is so dumb.  Avoid it at all cost.

The next morning he awakes to find his daughter kidnapped and him and his wife under surveillance by a shadowy group of men.  He is given until 5pm that day to get the patient to reveal a 6 digit number to him that is locked up in her head.  Meanwhile his wife is trapped in their flat and police woman Cassidy is piecing together a puzzle that begins with the discovery of two related murders.It doesn't matter how daft a story is if it manages to convince you for as long as it's on screen.  For example Face/Off has the most absurd plot in the world, but for 2 hours it doesn't matter and it carries you along.  This doesn't quite manage the same trick.  The plot is daft - every single part of it is silly from the idea of a girl being unreachable is daft, the idea of the gang doing this is daft and the way that with very little notice the gang manage to set up cameras everywhere.That said it has it's moments - the opening robbery is good and some of the drama works well.  However for too much of the film you feel like the director is really trying to make it feel more tense than it is - witness the scene where Conrad first finds talks to Patrick Koster on the phone, the camera spins wildly all round him.  Similarly he uses a lot of handheld stuff to give the impression of more action than is really happening, he also uses other lazy tricks like having everyone shouting their lines at times and making everyone squeal their tyres etc when they drive!  These combined with the silly plot make it hard to get into.Douglas is OK but he doesn't convince as the strong father figure that saves the day - he looks too old to take on Bean in a fight.  He also looks far to old to have a beauty like Famke Janssen.  She does well despite being stuck indoors all the time - the only problem with her is that she is far to warm and perfect a character.  Murphy is good although she has moments where she's too hammy.  Bean and his gang are good but they are distant from the action and never feel like a real threat - in fact you could almost sympathise with Bean, having been double-crossed at the start and wasting 10 years of his life.  Esposito is OK but she doesn't really have a character - she tries to be tough and slightly sassy (a role she did so well everyday in Spin City) but she comes across as nondescript as her black leather coat.  Victor Argo is a pleasure to see, but he's wasted here with nothing to do in a really small role.  Fans of Abel Ferrera will know him while he's been in other things (notably the two Smoke films) and know how good a character actor he can be.Overall this never manages to rise above it's silly plot.  It has it's moments but with lesser stars this would have been just another silly straight-to-video thriller. "},{"Title":"Somewhat formulaic thriller, simple story drawn out to elapse in 110 minutes, but with really good DVD extras.","Date":"2 March 2002","Score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  SPOILERS - DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET. The current IMDb average rating of 6.5 is a pretty accurate number. The story is simple. A crook Patrick (Irishman Sean Bean) just out of 10 years in prison needs to find the valuable red jewel that got him there in the first place. The daughter (Elisabeth, played by Brittany Murphy) of the double-crossing partner he threw in front of the NYC train in 1991 is now 18, the jewel was in her doll which she placed in his casket, buried on an island with only an 8-digit number identifying the burial plot. Having gone from one hospital to another as a mentally ill child, she knows the number but won't tell anyone. So famous child shrink Dr Conrad (Michael Douglas) is forced to find out, in 7 hours on Thanksgiving Day, or they will kill his kidnapped daughter Jessie (cute, talented Houstonian Skye Bartusiak).Put that into a straight story and it wouldn't be too exciting. So, we see the 1991 robbery and double-cross at the beginning, then the caption says ten years later. We see thugs break into an old woman's apartment, no idea why. Dr Conrad gets a 911 call from his associate (Oliver Platt). Dr Conrad's daughter shows up missing. Patrick tells Dr Conrad he has to get an 8-digit number from the patient by 5PM or his daughter will be killed. They don't give him any idea what the number is supposed to represent, no reason other than to create some audience suspense. We don't yet have any idea why she would know the number or what significance it might have.As the film unwinds we see the crooks have set up elaborate surveillance of Conrad's home, where his wife (Famke Janssen) is immobile, in a cast from a skiing accident. However, near the end she gets on her crutches and puts them to good use battling one crook. Early in the movie we see her scratch her leg under the cast using a long, pointed stick, which she then stores in her cast. We know it will come into better use later, and it does as she shoves it through the heart of the bad guy.Through a series of somewhat improbable actions everyone ends up on the little island at night where all the anonymous graves are. Liz wants to help save Jessie and, recalling herself on the ferry 10 years earlier, writes the number on a dusty plate of glass. As we watch, it looks like she is writing it backwards and, when they dig up the grave it's the wrong one. Dr Conrad turns the glass upsidedown, they dig up that grave, and presto! the doll and the jewel. In a somewhat innovative ending, Conrad fights a bad guy, a policewoman shows up, shots are fired, Conrad ends up with the jewel and a gun at Patrick's head, throws the jewel into a big pit shored up by wood bracing, pushes Patrick into it, more shots are fired, the pit caves in, Patrick is buried, everyone else lives happily ever after.A good movie is hard to write, especially writing a good ending.  I know I couldn't do it, and this author can't either. The whole movie pretty well follows typical Hollywood thriller formulas, but it is pretty entertaining anyway, especially since the story is told in a way that you don't really know what is going on until the very end. However, there is ultimately no good story here, nothing to take away or to compare to our experiences. That's why it's rating is between 6 and 7.The acting is uniformly good, and this role is the kind Michael Douglas has played in most of his movies. The real star is Brittany Murphy as Elisabeth. She is nothing short of award-caliber. The DVD extras are among the best, if you enjoy aspects of film-making. There are several behind-the-scenes extras that take you through various phases of making this film. Also included is the original screen test of Brittany Murphy, and it is hard to believe how fully she put herself into the character.  This is a case where many will find the DVD extras actually more interesting than the film itself. The sound is selectable to either DTS or Dolby Digital. I listened to the DTS track and it is well-done indeed.

I liked the directing, it was nothing fancy but it didn't take away any tension so it's a success in my opinion. The style used by Gary Fleder is pretty much the same as the one he used in the excellent 'Runaway Jury'. A film which I could recommend to anyone by the way.

A short time later strolling with his eight year old daughter, Elisabeth (Brittany Murphy) on the subway he's chased beaten and thrown to the tracks, by the crooks whom he double-crossed, where he's then run over by a train and killed before the eyes of his terrified daughter. Just before Elisabeth's dad is buried in Potter's Field his daughter puts her doll, Miska, in the Coffin with him not knowing that he hid the sought after ruby in it. Ten years later the crooks who killed her father, who were arrested on the scene and sentenced, are released from jail. The first thing that they do is go looking for Elisabeth to get the number of the grave that here father is buried in to get a hold of the ruby. Now how does Michael Douglas, Dr. Nathan Conrad, come in to all this? It seems that Dr. Conrad is a top hot shot psychiatrist who's associated with the mental hospital where Elisabeth is a patient. This is after she recognized one of the crooks who killed her father and went bananas and slashed him to death.The crooks want Dr. Conrad to find out from Elisabeth the number of her fathers grave by him getting her to talk to him. To make sure that Dr. Conrad cooperates they kidnap his eight year old daughter Jessie, Skye McCole, so that he gets the massage. The movie Don't say a word goes on with at least a dozen more sub-plots that would take a good size book to explain them all. The final scene in Potter's Field goes on for what seems to be an eternity.Under normal conditions you should have concern and sympathy for Dr. Conrad his wife and daughter, as well as young Elisabeth, but you just can't. The movie is so contrived that the characters didn't seem real so why even bother to care about them. The most absurd part in the movie, with so many absurd parts, was the hard as nails, all pampered and polished, detective Sandra Cassidy, Jennifer Esposito. Cassidy in the end of the film takes on the whole batch of hardened criminals single-handedly without even bothering to call or wait for back-up. Even Dirty Harry Callahan wouldn't do that and ends up wiping out almost all of them! even after taking a bullet in her gut! Cassidy is so though that she seems ready to get back on duty the next morning! And to think that there are some people who say that women can't cut it as policemen.

It's well directed by Gary Felder, and nicely shot, too.  All of which had me wondering what such obviously talented people were doing making such a banal, by-the-numbers film.  The problem here is a very slight screenplay which soon kills the tension by splitting the story into too many strands &#150; one involving a female detective who only seems to have been included so she can come to the rescue at the climax.  In any case, a story which hinges on the repressed memories of a girl who won't talk, and a trauma which happened ten years ago, is much better material for a book than a film &#150; and I'm sure Andrew Klavan's novel handled it more deftly.

Additionally, there is this semi-emotional scene with Douglas which makes no sense since the two never spoke during the entire film. (2) The placement of the extraordinary, surveillance equipment all over New York without a hint of how it got there. It relies upon the audience to formulate various ways in which it *could* have been placed there -- never a good idea. (3) No explanation why the whole focus of the movie, some small red jewel, was so immensely valuable beyond everything else.

Michael Douglas plays a prominent New York Psychologist who must unravel a 6-digit figure withheld by one of his most difficult patients in an attempt to save his daughter from the clutches of evil kidnappers.      From its' promising opening of a botched robbery, the film does take its' time to unravel and create some depth all the while making us understand and soaking us in the love this prominent figure has for his wife and his child. Director Gary Fleder (Kiss the Girls, Impostor) has not an impact on the thriller genre and must make another attempt at delivering a great thriller. His previous films have been mediocre creations and this thriller is no different. One astounding note in the film pertains to the casting of a young Brittany Murphy (Sidewalks of New York, Summer Catch) as the disillusioned patient who possesses a key secret at getting back what the kidnappers must acquire. .      Besides some pretty camera work and the monotonous and formulaic routine of a typical thriller, e.g. the 5 p.m. deadline &#150; or she dies&#133; the film never really seems to lift itself from its' own mediocrity. Sean Bean plays his typical role as a villain hell-bent on getting what he wants and will go to any length to get it, unfortunately, the audience has already digested this typical villain and he as an actor does not bring anything refreshing to the film.      The film is well done and will pass two hours for a viewer easily, yet as a thriller it fails to thrill the audience. How haunting is it to have one's daughter in the hands of a stranger? Douglas as our father figure does his best at comforting his bed-stricken wife (Famke Jansen) and taking matters into his own hands. He also manages his typical delivery where he pauses and reflects between each uttered phrase, but even he is getting repetitive at these films.  The film does not capture the intensity that such a situation would create.        Douglas seems perfectly cast as the prominent figure as audiences have internally come to associate him with difficult situations. Furthermore, who better to play this role as a pondering,&#145;balls out' Doctor who wants to save his daughter? Director Fleder relies on a formulaic approach in hopes of redeeming a tired and antiquated script. As for the characters that are embedded within the film, it seems to incorporate characters that seem strewn in simply to deter our thought patterns in unravelling this film. Note was that female Detective really necessary; and did she have to be that mean?       The only promising moment of the film was the climax in which point I could have solidified the labelling the film as a formulaic thriller.  An abandoned graveyard and decomposed corpses catalytically launch the film into an area of the formula for all formulaic thrillers. Its only satisfying attribute was the horrible death one of the characters would endure.     The film must be respected for its' ambitiousness, but it is clear that Director Fleder had made it a point to rely on his inefficient directing skills when tackling this weak script. It definitely had potential but fell apart at the midway point when the audience knew that the film would not deliver the expected thrills promised.Giancarlo's Rating **  "},{"Title":"Excellent acting carries you through","Date":"21 January 2002","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  The story is somewhat against all logic, but the acting here is that excellent that it doesn't mattered at all to me.

Of course, I never listen to another persons reviews.  Everyone has an opinion and rarely is it like mine.So, what's my opinion you ask?  The movie was good.  I found it to have a great story line and most of the acting was top notch.  The only acting that I didn't enjoy actually was Michael Douglas and his little girl early on.  I found that to be too cheezy.  On the other hand, I do understand why it was necessary for the story though.  Dont' get me wrong though.  It was only in that little section that Douglas' acting wasn't top notch... as usual... and that's only in my opinion.The movie itself was a terrific Psychological Thriller at it's best.  I'm sure if your here on IMDB, you know what it's all about, so I won't waste time talking of the storyline.  I will say however, that the story line was very good.  The character development was great too.  I loved all the characters and how they mixed in with each other.  I have a soft spot for these types of movies because I love it when you don't have a clue what's going on... until the end.  Movies like that are great and I will forever love them.

I suppose that in a 120 min production there is no time to expand on this character and her motivations (or, it was just poorly done).I also found the idea that Cassidy would be working Thanksgiving to id a Jane Doe a farce (without more insight into WHY it would be so important to do so).  Cassidy would just pop up, and then vanish after an insufficient impact to the story.  I knew she would be important to the ending only because her reason for being would be a bit pointless otherwise.Most of the other minor characters suffered similar fates and therefore the ending lacked much of its potential impact. I felt the story, pace, and plot was GREAT but the less than fluid character development moves it from a 8.5 down to a 7 (a 6 if you are not a Mike Douglas fan and a 5 if you also don't like suspense).If you have read the book you will probably be let down.

Douglas' character is the same one dimensional, I'm-gonna-get-my-daughter-take-no-crap guy who we've seen before.  And of course, don't forget the British bad guy who will stop at nothing to get what he wants.  If Douglas is such a genius in the field of psychiatry, why can't he play better mind games with the bad guys?  Also, do they have to throw in the unrealistic beautiful, young detective who looks like she came from the catwalk?  And can't we get a wife in Douglas' age bracket?  And why can't people kill a villain properly without him coming back for a second attack?For all it's bad points, it does add in some interesting things like Murphy's psycho girl character (Although this gets a little one dimensional at times.  Can't Murphy play another character?  Didn't we see this in Girl, Interrupted?).

It ranks up there with Don't Look in the Basement, Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead, and Don't Tell Her It's Me (all real titles). The title's not terribly descriptive, but it fits in with the plotline itself, which is pretty faceless.Douglas must be used to these roles by now, the domineering, I'm-in-charge, alpha male. He's played a powerful lawyer (Disclosure), a powerful financial genius (The Game), a powerful drug czar (Traffic), and the powerful leader of the free world (The American President). He basically sleepwalks through this movie, phoning in a pretty lethargic performance that adds no nuance to the character.In fact, the movie's a lot like Mercury Rising, which starred Bruce Willis as a renegade FBI agent protecting an autistic boy who had broken a supersecret government code. Will Nathan get the code from his traumatized patient in time to save his girl's life? With this type of movie, that question's no more than pure rhetoric. If you're at Point A and can see where the end of the movie (Point B) is, then the only way the movie can distinguish itself is to provide a gimmick. That gimmick is that the code that these evil bad guys (led by a superficially menacing Sean Bean) need is locked in the screwed-up mind of Elisabeth Burrows (newcomer Brittney Murphy), who isn't autistic but is so traumatized by the murder of her father years ago that she hardly speaks to anyone and reacts violently when approached. On top of all of this, Nathan's stock pretty wife Jessie (Skye McCole Bartusiak, looking like Sela Ward) is stuck in their apartment with a broken leg. (And you know, when a character has something slightly off-kilter about them, that quirkiness will play a role in the movie, somehow. It's like when a guy has a lisp - and then it turns out that the bad guy has a lisp, too. These things are hardly ever put in for no reason, you see.)Once we've established that the Bad Guys have the daughter and that the wife is stuck in bed with a cast, then we know Nathan must solve it on his own. To make sure, the Bad Guys tell him not to go to the cops. They don't need to say this, though; the Hero never goes to the cops. Too dangerous. Who'd believe him? And so on. So our stalwart, prominent psychiatrist goes it alone, for only he may save the day. Snore.Maybe it's Douglas, and maybe it's the shallowness of the supporting cast, but in so many of his movies the other actors seem to melt away. Sometimes it's because he's off the wall, a ham who doesn't chew the scenary so much as swallow it hole and regurgitate it onto your TV. (It's the Michael Douglas show! No wait; that was a different Mike Douglas.)The wonderful thing about characters with mental issues is that you can make those problems do whatever the script requires, with no real nod to logic or cohesion. These characters can be manipulated to fit any plot stupidities, including the dopey actions of the main characters. Don't Say a Word falls easily into this mold. And any movie that leans heavily on one gimmick isn't much of a movie, unless the characterizations and performances are well above par for the genre. They're not.This is drivel best relegated to the bargain bins at Blockbuster. From start to finish, there's not one true note to be found. Suspend your disbelief? You need to suspend it and then kick the chair out from underneath it. This movie doesn't approach credibility; it's a mere tourist in the land of reality.

It is thus tired and thoroughly predictable.In addition, the film's story is not very convincing, to say the least. The baddies seem to be unusually well-coordinated and skilled, yet they fail miserably at the hands of people who really shouldn't get the upper hand on guys like that. Moreover, there is a sympathy problem. The baddies are, clearly, bad and they're criminals, but they were double crossed themselves by the father of the girl in the asylum. He was one of their lot who simply wanted the loot all for himself, making him even less sympathetic than the others. The film ultimately fails as a result of this alone, to say nothing of the other problems. The reason for the girl not to cooperate thus loses sympathy and is less convincing, so that the viewers (some, at least) care less, making the film less compelling. I felt like they should just give the baddies the money and move on! On top of this, Sean Bean, who usually performs so well, is playing a relatively simple character compared to his normal roles, and he comes off as rather sympathetic in a way. He doesn't seem all that bad, and certainly not bad enough for the nasty, and predictable, end that befalls him.Ther are a few good points. The film does succeed somewhat at building the tension of the mystery surrounding the girl, etc., and has some fairly decent action scenes, while I always enjoy watching Michael Douglas and Sean Bean.The result is that one can see where the film is going almost (but not quite) the whole time, gets bored, and fails to care about the supposed good guys or their motives. The film could have been much more interesting had they utilised the greyness of the characters and use this to lead to a very different ending, rather than pretending that these rather grey characters are black and white.

They'll never tell.","Date":"9 April 2004","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Manhattan psychiatrist Doctor Nathan Conrad (Michael Douglas) leads a fulfilling life. He arrives home to his posh apartment bursting with delight to greet his daughter Jessie, who in characteristic 8-year old fashion wants to play hide and seek with Daddy. The only possible downer in Conrad's life right now is that his much younger wife Aggie (Famke Janssen) has a broken leg and is confined to bed. But Nathan's ability as the super-husband effortlessly takes care of her sponge baths and breakfast in bed &#150; in a few swift camera cuts we see Douglas jiving in the kitchen while whipping up some tasty french toast!We briefly witness a typical consultation in Conrad's practice, and it's interesting to see Douglas in psychiatrist mode. But Conrad's talents are about to be stretched beyond typical. A former colleague at a mental institution (which looks like it hasn't been cleaned for years) wants him to look over a difficult patient (Brittany Murphy as Elisabeth Burrows.) It's immediately obvious she's been scarred early on in her life, as a result she's done some nasty things that may keep her in the institution for some time. Conrad stays calm and handles her capably.The next day his perfect world is thrown off the tracks, when his daughter is kidnapped by criminals, led by Patrick Koster (Sean Bean). They want to make amends for a bank heist that failed for them 10 years ago. To do this, Dr Conrad has been chosen as the guy who can deliver a six-digit code, locked away in the troubled mind of his new patient. It's the only way for him to get his daughter back. While his wife becomes demanding and irrational (who can blame her?) he makes the decision from the outset to work as intelligently as he can.Koster imposes a time limit on Conrad getting the number, threatening his daughter will be killed. The reasons for this are unknown to the audience and probably the scriptwriters. Koster has waited 10 years since the foiled robbery, but why can he only spare 5 hours for Conrad to extract the required digits? Nathan after all is forgoing his usual hourly fee. There is no explanation for incorporating this ticking clock element. Making even less sense, this &#145;device' is confusingly done away with later on. We are expecting a threat to be carried out, but Koster's supposed ruthlessness falls short like this quite often. Early on it is enjoyable seeing this close family unit in action. Despite having seen Douglas in many similar roles, he suits the protective husband/father role nicely. Douglas the actor has an instinctive feel of how to play a parent on-screen, and no doubt his real experiences as a father contribute to this.On the down-side, there are under-developed characters tagging along here. The tough detective Sandra Cassidy is always a step behind the action, and the former colleague of Conrad's played by Oliver Platt has an ambiguous role, even by the end we aren't sure what his character is to bring to the film. His exit involves him being accused of involvement in an unrelated murder which has no bearing on this story. The film then casts this plot point aside, expecting the audience to forget all about this dead end.Famke Janssen's bedridden wife sees her right out of the action; her only shining moment is when she clashes with one of the baddies. She knows the location of her daughter. Koster sends someone to finish her off, then abandons his surveillance on her before the job is done. Who do you think will be the one to get done? The daughter is unconvincing in the company of the bad guys (a weakness in the script and direction, no fault of the young actress.) At one stage, all too bored with hostage-holding, Jessie starts singing, almost charming a tattooed crim into joining in for the chorus.Now to Brittany Murphy's performance, and yes, she produces some convincing acting here. She apparently liked to sing to herself on set before takes, so she's quite a natural at playing &#145;mentally unstable'. She's a petite girl, far from the presence of the violent attacker she is playing. The writers have written a complex character, but haven't developed the script enough to fully flesh out her complexities. Example when the storyline needs her character to comply with Douglas in sneaking her out of hospital for a field trip to a subway (a dose of harrowing flashbacks), she conveniently obliges. I wondered if Elisabeth would be straight back in the asylum when this was over. Surely her  issues can't be resolved in the space of the 24 hours we witness? Don't watch this film with the aim to gain any insight into psychiatric illnesses.Nearing the finale, Douglas's &#145;caring family guy' physically fights back against the extortionists. Although they do go easy on him - while Conrad is engaged in violent shovel-flinging with one of the baddies, the others stand back and chuckle. This was the biggest disappointment, that a film based around overcoming mental issues is resolved with physicality and a fight-to-the-death sequence.This film almost works thanks to some engaging work from the lead actor. Those responsible for the screenplay haven't given us enough of the characters we might be interested in. Douglas has to carry the film, it's a perfectly solid performance, but far from any of his great roles. Underwritten characters always result in people we just can't care for. Too much suspension of disbelief is required, due to plot holes and the stupidity of the one-dimensional baddies. For those only looking for action, the opening bank robbery is the height of excitement, and you may get a rise out of the finale, but the script is empty of any intelligent twists, which is essential in a good psychological thriller. Besides, haven't people have had enough of watching terror in New York City, especially when it ends in a graveyard? 2 stars out of 5 "},{"Title":"Not a single believable element in the plot","Date":"17 April 2004","Score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Amazing!

It still provides the movie with some good moments and characters and also give the movie an extra sense of professionalism involved. Sean Bean is a great as the main villain and delivers an absolute fine performance. Michael Douglas is also great as the leading man, mainly because he doesn't play him as an 'hero' but an ordinary everyday person instead. Douglas is always fine in these sort of roles. Some other excellent actors play some smaller parts in the movie. Actors such as; Brittany Murphy, Oliver Platt, Victor Argo and last but not least Famke Janssen. They all help to make the movie look better and more interesting than it in fact really is. Most of the characters are however pretty flat. Why does Famke Janssen even play the wife? It's a role basically every actress could had played. This movie just didn't seem like a very challenging or original project to get involved with. And I also have the feeling that the movie would had been better of without the Jennifer Esposito. Just think about it, was she really necessary for the movie and its story? Her character is not engaging enough, since it's not she we need to care about or cheer for but the Michael Douglas character instead, who is the main lead of the movie. Her character is distracting from the movie its main story.The movie is certainly style-full and it does have its moments. But in the end it just really falls flat as a really good or original thriller. All of the moments in the movie are just too predictable and the movie doesn't offer any real surprises. Therefor this movie just isn't anymore than a well made but standard formulaic thriller.It's a movie that does serve its purpose and the movie certainly is watchable as a simple standard thriller. Fans of the genre will probably still be the most entertained by it but even they have to conclude that this movie is far from being one of the best thrillers released in recent years.

The late Brittany Murphy plays Elizabeth, a disturbed young girl who resides in a psychiatric facility, haunted by a violent past trauma, unable to cope or communicate. A decade earlier, she witnessed her father brutally murdered by a group of jewel thieves, bent on finding out the location of a priceless gem he hid somewhere. Michael Douglas plays Nathan Conrad, the psychiatrist tasked with unlocking the secrets of Elizabeth's mind. The trouble arises when Patrick Koster (Sean Bean), leader of the thieves, catches on and promptly kidnaps Conrad's daughter (Sky McCole, RIP) as leverage to find the whereabouts of the jewel. A tense game of cat, mouse and killer ensues as Bean's crew basically terrorizes Douglas's family. Murphy gives the best performance as the damaged teenager fighting tooth and nail to suppress the horror of times past. Douglas makes a solid protagonist and desperate father, struggling to protect his daughter and wife (Famke Janssen) whilst in the midst of crisis. Bean carries the villain role nicely, never moustache twirling yet maintaining the menace terrifically and holding his end up. There's supporting work from Oliver Platt, David Warshofsky, Victor Argo, Jennifer Esposito, Shawn Doyle and Aiden Devine as well. It's standard thriller territory, helped nicely by its cast and given an extra shot of quality by Brittany Murphy's superb work.

Sean Bean plays the standard villain similar to his role in Goldeneye.

Her character is suppose to be a superb mimic which makes it a daunting challenge for any actor. There is something wrong with her scenes. It's either her performance or the material. It doesn't come off well. It feels like bad camp. The kidnapping is more compelling and keeps my interest. I like Famke Janssen and her broken leg. That part has some tension.

Visually, it's easy on the eye and its plot involves bank robbery, murder and kidnapping as well as an ordinary man who has to do something extraordinary in order to save the life of his child. The stakes are high and the tension grows steadily until things become even more desperate as time starts to run out. Interestingly, the story has a few different strands which eventually converge and the pace of the action is lively throughout.A gang breaks into a bank and steals just one high value item (a gem worth $10 million) but after making a clean getaway, it's soon discovered that one of the criminals has double-crossed his associates and has absconded with the jewel. The other gang members then hunt him down and kill him in a subway station.Ten years later, after having served their time in prison, the gang kidnap the 8-year-old daughter of Dr Nathan Conrad (Michael Douglas) who's a highly respected New York psychiatrist. Conrad is a specialist in dealing with teenage patients and the kidnappers demand that he elicit from one of his patients a 6-digit number which is buried somewhere in her troubled mind. Jessie Conrad (Skye McCole Bartusiak) is abducted early in the morning of Thanksgiving Day and Dr Conrad is given until 5.00pm to get the necessary information. If he fails Jessie will be killed.Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy) is a particularly challenging patient who has been institutionalised for many years and has displayed a confusing variety of symptoms. Conrad eventually gains her cooperation when he tells her that his daughter has been kidnapped and through his efforts, it's gradually discovered that her trauma originated in an incident, which happened ten years earlier when she saw her father being killed by the gang who'd committed the bank robbery. The significance of the 6-digit number then becomes clear, as it's a vital piece of information which could enable the gang to locate the stolen gem.Sean Bean gives a strong performance as the vicious gang leader and powerfully projects just how cold, clever and threatening his character really is. The way that he uses surveillance equipment to watch Dr Conrad's family before and after Jessie's abduction is also very scary as it quickly becomes clear that the gang can see everything that the family do at all times and Conrad's wife Aggie (Famke Janssen) is particularly vulnerable as she's bedridden with a broken leg.Michael Douglas is typically polished as an ordinary professional man who loves his family and then becomes desperate and fearful when his daughter's life is threatened and he's given an absurdly tight deadline within which to meet the criminals' unreasonable demands.Britanny Murphy is fantastic as the mentally disturbed teenager with a history of having violent outbursts and patterns of behaviour that have puzzled the professionals for some years. The power and intensity that she brings to the part is surprisingly strong and believable and makes her performance one that's definitely not to be missed.

Michael Douglas did a fantastic job as a passionate father willing to do anything to preserve the life of his daughter. His wife however (Famke Jansenn) really kicks some serious butt, for a lady on crutches. She's very intuitive and although being confined to a bed for most of the movie, she still manages to play an integral role. The main villain Patrick, didn't sound the part with his rather refined English accent, but he certainly played the part well through his manipulation of the Conrad family.Brittany Murphy did a stellar job in her role as a neurotic young lady who holds the key to the mystery of the movie, a numbered code. Finally, Jennifer Esposito, surprised me in that she's dropped dead gorgeous, but she proved to be as tough as nails and persistent in trying to find the connections between a number of unsolved deaths. At the end she takes a bullet for a worthy cause and is the x-factor hero, so to speak, of the entire film.

Director Gary Fleder, here, proves he can tackle a thriller in every sense of the word, operating in what you must admit to being a workmanlike and engaging enough manner to supplement a recommendation. Being able to sit there and box tick where it is characters suffer epiphanies and will eventually come to garner the upper hand is not the point; watching a director carefully execute a concept thriller whilst balancing the basic but enjoyable plot mechanisms and manoeuvring the characters around in a thorough and competent enough fashion whilst adhering, in an entertaining manner, to both generic demands and conventions is what is enjoyably garnered the most out a film like this.The film runs on a workable premise linked to that of a specific number, a number that is hard to come by and a number which will garner its bearer access to that of a priceless ruby located out and around the New York City area. The catch is, that it's embedded within the mind of somebody whom very rarely is in the mood to tell it, indeed anything, to anyone at all; furthermore, the lives of certain people our eventual protagonist dearly loves will come to be in great danger, and his ability to obtain this number will dictate as to whether they survive. The protagonist is a certain Nathan Conrad, a doctor and educated psychiatrist; an easy glide across his office which harbours his credentials in the form of certificates and qualifications outlining his knowledge and experience within the field. In his office, he's calm amidst a delicate situation and keeps cool and methodical where others may have acted out in a different, more negative manner, when he enlightens, in an unpatronising manner, some stern speakings to a young high-schooler sent to the good doctor on account of stealing certain clothing garments belonging a female colleague at school. Out of the office, he's working up at a mental institute named Bridgville, partaking in a rapid-fire exchange about the ins and outs of various things within the field to an accomplice, thus highlighting both the general professionalism and clinical ability of his nature.Conrad will later come to have to deal with a situation of an even more delicate nature, that being when Sean Bean's professional thief Patrick Koster and his crew get out of prison following a ten year stretch linked to the theft of a ruby. It is not, however, the theft of a priceless ruby which incarcerated them, more-so the careless murder in a public place of a back-stabbing accomplice which sends them all down; their taking over of a Manhatten apartment overlooking Conrad's own sparking into life a chain of events linked to a young patient at Bridgeville named Elisabeth Burrows (Murphy), and more specifically, the aforementioned number she knows which will somehow bring about the ruby for Koster and crew. With Nathan's young daughter taken and imprisoned within the apprehended apartment to compensate for police interference, and Nathan's wife, in Famke Janssen's character Aggie, flat on her back and therefore incapacitated by way of a cast around a broken leg, our lead must face the fight of a ticking clock alone.The film keeps the villains basic but effectively nasty; Bean in particular taking glee at playing it lean and mean; an incarnation of a British gangster whom has somehow ended up performing heists at jewellers based in New York City with a ditsy array of criminal cohorts, a disparate group of your more typical movie bad-guys ranging from the hulking brute that says very little but is good enough to guard a hostage to the ugly, thin, wormy looking guy charged with slinking around on a motorcycle following the lead's every move. Even more bizarrely, one sidekick even appears to channel that of African-American hacker Theo, in John McTiernan's 1988 film Die Hard, a sports obsessed; rather loud mouthed and perhaps overly cynical technological whizz brought along for all the stuff related to laptops and monitors. The film additionally covers a female police detective named Sandra Cassidy (Esposito), someone sharp in seeing what others seemingly do not; her observations on a dead body an object lesson in homicide evaluation to her male cohorts. While the presence of a strong female character in this regard dutifully makes up for the fact the only other woman even close to the action is Famke Janssen stuck in a bed-placed position, the film struggles with her overall placement in regards to proceedings; as if starting at the end as to how she becomes more inherently involved in the film was focused upon before the effective working backwards so as to try and tie her in more and more.Fleder keeps things moving along in a smooth and sharp manner, so much so that we are engaged in each of the respective characters' plights and involved enough to, on one or two occasions, be somewhat affected by the transitions and realisations certain characters must drag themselves through when the time demands it. We come to dislike the baddies just as much as we come to sympathise with the supporting Murphy, her subplot seeing her forced into the role of the victim during one's childhood and neatly going on to echo the role of Nathan's daughter when she herself is caught up in the middle of all this; both of whose plights are effectively caused by the same lone individual and the greed that person accentuates- it coming to endanger those whom they love concurrent with those others hold just as dear as the effect ripples down. The film is a smooth, workmanlike ride through thriller territory.

There certainly seem to be more leading roles for men in their fifties and sixties than there are for women of the same age. There is, however, a price to be paid for this greater longevity. Modern leading men who prolong their careers into these decades tend to end up being cast in less interesting roles than younger men. Although there are exceptions, notably Clint Eastwood, it is rare to find a male star who can live up, in the second half of his career, to his achievements in the first.Michael Douglas is a case in point. In the late eighties and early nineties he was one of the most talked-about actors in Hollywood. Although there were occasional exceptions (I doubt if many people stood round the water-cooler discussing the merits of Shining Through), most of his films from Romancing the Stone in 1984 until around the time of The American President in 1995 were widely discussed topics of conversation. Many of them were discussed not merely because of their intrinsic merits but also (as in the case of Fatal Attraction, Wall Street, Basic Instinct or Falling Down) because of their controversial content. In recent years, although he has continued taking leading roles in films, he has not aroused anything like the same amount of attention; conversations about him around the water-cooler probably concentrate more on his marriage to Catherine Zeta Jones than on his films.Don't Say a Word is one of Douglas's more recent films. It is thriller of a type which dates back at least as far as Hitchcock's original The Man who Knew Too Much from the thirties but which has become very fashionable in recent years. Other recent examples include Trapped, Red Eye and Firewall. The basic premise is that the villains kidnap or make threats against a member of the hero's family in order to force the hero to assist them in some nefarious scheme. The villains usually want the hero to play some active part in their criminal enterprise rather than simply to pay a ransom (although Trapped is an exception in this respect).Douglas plays Dr Nathan Conrad, an eminent New York psychiatrist, whose young daughter Jessie is kidnapped by the villains. Their demand is an unusual one. One of Conrad's patients is a mentally disturbed young woman named Elisabeth Burrows. Locked in Elisabeth's memory is a six-digit number which, it turns out, is the key to the location of a priceless jewel. (Its precise significance does not become clear until near the end of the film). Conrad's task is to try and persuade Elisabeth to divulge this number. He has eight hours in which to accomplish this task, failing which Jessie will be killed. That is the bones of the plot, although there are a number of sub-plots; Conrad's wife Aggie, at home in bed with a broken leg, is menaced by one of the gang, Jessie struggles to free herself from her kidnappers, and a female police detective is on the trail of the villains.Don't Say a Word is not a bad film, and although there are some plot holes- it is never, for example, made clear how Elisabeth knew the location of the missing jewel, or how the villains knew that she knew- it avoids many of the other flaws which have disfigured a number of recent thrillers. It does not, for example, descend into sadistic vindictiveness in the way that Trapped does. Nor does it rely upon a succession of implausible plot twists, inserted for no good reason other than to show off the scriptwriter's cleverness. Some have complained that Famke Janssen is too young and attractive to be married to an older man like Conrad, but in fact she is four years older than Douglas's real-life wife. Douglas, in fact, plays his part well, as do most of the other actors, especially Brittany Murphy as the disturbed Elisabeth. Director Gary Fleder handles the action sequences well and develops a real sense of tension. As another reviewer has pointed out, the atmosphere of the film is close, oppressive and claustrophobic, especially in the final scenes in the Potter's Field graveyard.The problem with the film is that its central premise has been overworked. Familiarity with this sort of plot line has bred contempt, so that even when a relatively good example of this particular sub-genre comes along it can seem hackneyed. Few of Douglas's earlier films were masterpieces, but most of them were at least original enough to arouse the viewer's interest and to remain in his or her memory. Don't Say a Word, by contrast, is an OK thriller, but not really a memorable one. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Best taken as a big-budget B movie","Date":"26 January 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" Don't Say a Word is the type of contrived, overblown thriller that Hollywood (and apparently, a bulk of American movie audiences) loves, a film that's more than a little ridiculous when you take a step away from it. Despite its obvious big-studio backing and a cast of familiar faces, Word works best as a slick, pulpy thriller where lapses in logic, character consistency, and reality all contribute to the bizarre appeal of it all. The film opens with a 1991 bank robbery where Sean Bean is ripped off by two of his own; a decade later, the gang returns to seize the item they lost. The problem? Only a mentally disturbed young woman (Brittany Murphy) purportedly knows its whereabouts. When psychiatrist Michael Douglas reluctantly takes the woman as a patient, Bean and his gang take his daughter, and Word becomes a beat-the-clock thriller that, for the most part, moves with fluid efficiency. While certain aspects, like Jennifer Esposito's driven cop and Famke Janssen's bedridden wife seem forcibly shoehorned into the script (by Anthony Peckham and Patrick Smith Kelly) and can be distracting, the core of Word is the convincing relationship between Douglas and Murphy, both of whom turn in excellently offbeat performances. Even though the climax takes turns into the unbelievable, it works based on how much we've invested in the duo up to that point. And director-for-hire Gary Fleder keeps things moving at such a brisk clip that questions of narrative logic won't pop up until the credits roll. Put your brain on the shelf and enjoy.

Kiss the Girls was a kidnapping movie, but one of the victims escaped. Imposter had the main character believed to be an alien. Runaway Jury was a typical courtroom drama with someone on the outside. And now Don't Say a Word is a regular thriller about a child kidnapped. However, the one main `twist' is that to have the daughter released, the father (Michael Douglas) has to find a six-digit number from one of his patients (Brittany Murphy) before 5 o'clock that day. Betcha didn't see that one coming.There is really nothing in Don't Say a Word that's especially original. For the most part, it's just a typical child-in-danger scenario where the father (who always has a prominent job) cracks and does whatever he can to save her (the child is always female). The turn in the movie was welcome, although the movie doesn't really start until about 30 minutes into it, which went by quite quickly. The rest of the movie seems to drag on and on, but I digress. There is always one kidnapper who is a little kinder, and almost folds under pressure. The mother is always handicapped in the beginning but soon rises to the occasion. There are a whole lot more clichés I could go through, but I think I'll stop.I can understand how Don't Say a Word would be Murphy's breakout role, but it doesn't really show how she could become today's `it-girl' that she is now. This role isn't one that teenagers could identify with. Come to think of it, I couldn't identify with her. I couldn't read her face; tell what her emotions were. For a role that required the audience to feel with her and feel what she was going through, it didn't work. Douglas acted, well, as Michael Douglas. Nothing new.As in all generic thrillers, there are some good, tense scenes (although it's obvious what would happen), but nothing new. When, at the end, we find out what the numbers stand for, they throw it in our face and there's even a line like, `I KNOW the number's for a&#133;', when they never even mentioned it before. Lastly, I could have done without the multiple flashbacks. It would have been more effective without them. To wrap it all up, Don't Say a Word is not a bad movie, it's just generic.My rating 6/10Rated R for violence, including some gruesome images, and language.

Michael Douglas was great as a man racing against time to unlock the mystery surrounding a young patient in order to get his kidnapped daughter back. Director Gary Fleder creates a suitably rainy, dreary atmosphere for the film and gives the big city of New York a strange sense of claustrophobia. Sean Bean heads the bad guys in his usual villainous manner, Famke Janssen is good but rather wasted as Douglas' bed-ridden wife, and Britany Murphy is a standout as the girl who isn't as troubled as she leads people to believe. Murphy is definitely one of the few teen actors in Hollywood with any talent, and her performance here is excellent. Jennifer Esposito is good as a cop involved with a double murder that ultimately develops a connection to the main story, though we never learn much about her character other than the fact she wants to get things solved. Perhaps there were already enough characters to work with. Oliver Platt rounds out the cast as a colleague of Douglas' who always seems to be hiding more than he's telling.For a film that runs nearly two hours, it flies by rather quickly, with a lot of suspense and good performances from everyone involved, all leading up to a tense climax on an East River island that looks like it came from an old Hammer horror film. My only complaint is that, after this big build up for almost two hours that we know Douglas and Bean are ultimately going to go at it, the demise (and I think it's giving nothing away to say the villain gets his at the end) of Bean's character was rather lackluster.But otherwise, it's a solid thriller that delivers a good deal of suspense, excellent performances, and an intriguing story.

It took 12 years to carefully craft *this* screenplay?  It plays like a rough draft that was written in about 2 weeks, in which all the ideas of pacing and characters were lifted directly from one of those how to write a screenplay books -- bland, ordinary, and predictable.Now at first, it tries to fool you into thinking it's going to be more ambitious than it is, but guess again.  If you think you know where it's heading, you're probably right.That said, visually it gets the job done, and Michael Douglas plays his standard role as only he can.  I wonder if he makes movies like these so he can maintain his A-list status while still appearing in good movies like Wonder Boys and Traffic.A POSSIBLY SPOILING FOOTNOTE  Also on the DVD, there's a special feature listed wherein different actors give scene-specific commentary.  This is somewhat of a falsehood, because the actors don't really talk about anything that's happening in the scene that plays... it's really just them talking about the experience of making the movie.

Everything about it the contrived script; walk-through performances, fashionable production values and publicity are merely adequate.  It's a picture that gives about the same thrill to viewers as watching their favorite sitcom reappear in syndication; you've seen it already, but you like it enough to watch reruns.  Whatever.  What I will say is that it's the same kind of annoying, manipulative hokum that Ron Howard's RANSOM was.  All I kept thinking was how the kidnappers should have severed the brat's ear or thumb to keep the overtly caring parents in line from the start.  It always amazes me how Hollywood films think that everyone, even the vilest villain, is susceptible to the charms of small children, and that people always put kids first no matter what the price or motivation.  There's nothing more tiring to me than having a perky child actor or WB-type teen idol as set dressing in R-rated thrillers and action films (remember Hugh Jackman's obligatory brat in SWORDFISH - give me a break!).  It's also annoyingly common, once again, that the criminals are able to utilize sophisticated, expensive high-tech equipment with ease, even though they generally behave like idiots and botch up most of the critical aspects of their evil plans.  In any event, this movie is as derivative of current Hollywood action/thrillers as you can get, so enjoy...if you're not tired of the usual big-budget studio product.  As for me, I think I'll just avoid movies with kids and computers in them. Hollywood film makers would do well to follow my lead.

Now, the main plot to the movie is obviously about the six digit number that is wanted by Patrick and he's going to do anything to get it, so he can get his jewel. Now, of course we're going to think of things like 'what is the number' or 'why does he want this jewel so badly, even after 10 years,' etc. so when we find out, as the movie goes on, (Even though they basically tell us at the beginning.) we're still left thinking 'is that it.' Okay, fine he wanted the money that the jewel is worth, but poor Elisabeth, especially is she's apparently pretending to be 'mad,' just so she can escape the bad guys and stay in the institution.

Allow everyone to discover that Don't Say A Word is an intelligent, suspenseful and well written movie. With his role as Dr. Nathan Conrad in Don't Say A Word, Michael Douglas has proven he still has the ability to charm audiences and continue to deliver great performances.Mystery is one of my favorite genres to watch on screen because it forces the mind to work and locate the villain. One of the requirements for mystery is to keep the villain's identity hidden; however, there are exceptions to this rule. When the identity is revealed early, I look to see how well the villain is doing at keeping the suspense alive for the audience. With Don't Say A Word, Sean Bean does a tremendous job as the chief villain as he raises the level of difficulty for his adversary.The utterance of Michael Douglas' name should be enough to convince them that the movie will be successful. I knew immediately when I heard his name mentioned in relation Don't Say A Word I recognized I was going to receive 110 percent effort, quality, reliability and success. Quality, credibility and reliability are three huge assets Douglas brings to each film he stars in; therefore, I'm confident every film will be successful.Don't Say Word has laid the foundation for Douglas to let everyone know that he is still in his prime. One common thread I found in Douglas' 35-year film career was the impact he made in each film he starred. For example films such as Romancing The Stone, War Of The Roses, Wall Stret, A Perfect Murder and The Game, Douglas has been able to make the film better as he does with Don't Say A Word. Other attributes Douglas brings are charm, charisma and presence; three reasons why he is one of the best dramatic actors in Hollywood.Don't Say A Word involves a psychiatrist who must retrieve a six digit code from one of his patients, who happens to be the daughter of a man who stole a precious gem from his cohorts in crime. Douglas portrays the desperate psychiatrist who has eight hours to retrieve this six-digit code to save the life of his wife and daughter.Throughout Don't Say A Word, Douglas' performance brought back memories of The Game, because both are smart, clever and psychologically draining. Through his ability to draw my attention into the plot and ability to bring me into story brought satisfaction and convinced me Don't Say A Word works as a mysterious, psychological thriller.One unique quality that Douglas holds over his colleagues is the ability to convince the audience of his plight; a situation is most evident in his portrayal of Dr. Conrad. I could feel the intensity and suspense utilized for his role in this film. Douglas has a remarkable and tremendous ability to reel the audience in and make them a part of the film. When Douglas and other actors are able to accomplish this feat, everyone can be assured with the knowledge that he is the top of his profession as well as the movie he stars in will turn out successful results.As I stated earlier, Bean's performance in Don't Say A Word is played to perfection; however, I didn't realize how convincing was in the role. It is extremely enjoyable to watch films that contain actors who look their parts because it makes the film much more credible. I'm glad I got the opportunity to watch Bean in action because it is not often I see a convincing villainous performance. My only wish is to watch him star in more films, much more frequently because he is a huge talent.Brittany Murphy was the best thing to happen to Don't Say A Word because she brought this movie to life. Her role in this film should be used as model for future psychological thrillers because of her ability to capture the true essence of her character. Murphy portrays her character so well and close to reality, I nearly forgot she was an actress. Murphy will only travel one direction from her role in Don't Say A Word. This direction will lead her many opportunities to star in great films; this direction is up. I wish her well.The plot may not be new but is very enjoyable to watch everything play out. I hope the writers don't listen to the critics because there are still fans of these films.The emergence of Murphy, a well-written script and the ability to keep everyone in suspense are reasons everyone must see Don't Say A Word. Two thumbs up.

Then I realized that it wasn't the acting I didn't like, it was the script. On the one hand Koster is intelligent enough to develop a quite complicated plan to get this number. On the other hand he is acting like he is thinking with his fists instead of his brain, killing a lot of people. Koster is the evil guy, who is doing a lot of bad things to achieve his aim and that's it. You don't get enough information about him. His reasons are not explained. Why is this stone so special? Wouldn't it be easier to steal another one?The character has no depth.

Brittany Murphy (whom you might remember as Daisy from Girl, Interrupted) played her part of the psychiatric patient brilliantly.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if Ms. Murphy were to be nominated for an Oscar for her role.  The Academy seems to like acknowledging actors who portray lunatics or prostitutes.

They can do no wrong and you're safe as long as they're around. Once you've run the whole story through your mind, you'll find this theme in Don't Say a Word. Director Gary Fleder manages to build a decent thriller around this childhood truth. To me, that this film MEANS SOMETHING means, well, everything. A meaningful thriller is a rare thing.Michael Douglas' psychologist, Dr. Nathan Conrad, is driven to desperate acts to rescue his daughter from kidnapers. Word falls into the now-familiar sub-genre 'kidnap thriller.' It parallels this year's inferior Along Came a Spider and the Ron Howard near-masterpiece, Ransom. Word is more like the latter because it pits the hapless normal-guy-turned-vigilante against cunning and ruthless criminals. But for his daughter, Jessie, Conrad is anything but normal. She's not looking for the police or a super hero to save her, she's looking to her real life super hero, daddy. She never once doubts his abilities. This aspect wasn't explored in Ransom, because the boy was gagged for most of that movie, making it much more disturbing. Jessie is able to disarm her captors with her cuteness, making conversation, conning them for a p,b,& j sandwich. Her behavior just makes so much darn sense. A kid that age doesn't know what evil is. This captor/captive dynamic is interesting to watch, and as the story nears its close you find it's not the little girl you're worried about. Kids don't come to harm in films; you just don't do that. It's dad's fate, or actually, Jessie's perception of him that is really at stake. Fleder knows this and directs accordingly. M. Night Shyamalan explored the super-parent theme much more directly and more from the child's point of view in Unbreakable.  Aggie Conrad's crippled state is important here because her broken leg (due apparently to a skiing accident) has only begun to teach Jessie that her parents are not indestructible. By putting mom in real danger and then having her fight her way out of it has significance other than thrills she becomes the hero her daughter sees her as. Scenes like this are the key to any thriller's success. It really gives you something to cheer about.  Elisabeth's story is the foundation of the film, though. The situation Conrad now finds himself in is all due to her childhood trauma, witnessing dad, the invincible protector, come to his end. I was disappointed in how little her character was explored and how little Brittany Murphy was given to work with. I'm not sure why they chose to make Elisabeth 'dangerous.' The murder of the orderly was completely unnecessary. Her motivation for doing it (or was she set up?) is never explained other than its timing coincides with Patrick Koster's release from prison. In the end it hurts the audience's perception of her. It detracts from the real healing that takes place when Dr. Conrad survives rescuing his daughter.             Don't Say a Word isn't a terribly imaginative or clever thriller, but very entertaining nonetheless. Look for a couple of brief, long shots of a foggy NYC skyline that includes the Twin Towers (thanks for not cutting these shots out).

Michael Douglas is perfectly cast as a psychologist whose daughter is kidnapped by a group of greedy bank-robbers, who kidnap her in exchange for a mysterious number that only his disturbed patient (Brittany Murphy) knows.  Murphy is terrific in the role of a schitzo.  She's actually took on the role of a schitzo (though more low-key) in the critically-acclaimed Girl Interrupted, but this was a more brutal, difficult role for her and she succeeded with flying colors.  I was actually terrified by her in a few sequences, even when she--no pun intended--didn't say a word.  Her look alone is terrifying enough--and that's admirable for a fairly attractive girl to pull off.  Guy Torry is a good, underrated comedian, but he seemed out of place as one of the villains.  Like all comedians taking on movie roles, they try to be funny and witty--even when the scene doesn't call for it.  Torry was good in the very dramatic American History X, but here he seemed out of place and his humor didn't mesh well with the moments of suspense.The detective work is quite interesting with Jennifer Esposito (in her first role in a big Hollywood movie) as a tough-as-nails female detective. Esposito is very good and very convincing.  However, the plot goes through the same motions we've encountered in previous films of this type (i.e. Ransom).  The human drama is overshadowed by preposterous action sequences.  We have Douglas suddenly taking the role of the action hero (like all fathers in these movies), driving through a Thanksgiving parade, stealing boats, beating up security guards, etc.  So for all you daughters out there--if your boyfriend gives you crap, you know who to call. Super-Dad!  But of course, that's only if you live in the world of Hollywood cinema.  Also in this world, the little 8-year-old daughter is smart as hell.  Even smarter than the parents, in certain aspects.  Show me some 8-year-old girls like that.  They certainly don't belong to my family.  And having his wife (Famke Jaansen) as a cripple was merely a setup for a later scene in which she breaks out of her cast and uses her crutches as weapons. Wow, don't underestimate the power of a paraplegic.  The climax in the graveyard has that typical Hollywood quality to it as well.  Every time I watch these movies, I wanna scream out at the hero, Unless you shoot the villain 25 guys--HE'S NOT DEAD!!!  When I first started watching movies, I was surprised when a villain would come back for a last scare and start shooting at our hero, bloody and beaten.  Now I feel jaded.  So unless I see the bad guy with 25 bulletholes, I know  A)  He's not dead, or B) He's coming back in the sequel.  I never understood the subplot with Oliver Platt and the death of the girl Susan.  I guess I just couldn't get thoroughly engaged into the plot.Don't Say A Word is OK, mild entertainment for two hours, but altogether forgettable.  Should you see it?  Should you not?

I do wonder what would happen if Hitchcock were alive today and what he'd do with some of these ideas. But what really does it in is a contrived, violent finale, an annoying Esposito character, too much plot, and a trailer that gives away a certain line. Not too mention that this is territory already covered by who knows how many other movies.First off, Michael Douglas really can't be graded for his role here because he's done it before, many times over again. He gives one of those speeches that he always does in the last third of the movie, showing that he isn't the same simple-minded yuppie as in the beginning. But he's done this before in Fatal Attraction, The Game, partially in Traffic, and a few others. And I smiled in this film when he made the speech, happy to see him do it again, who knows how many times. The Line I was talking about, I'll never Tell. Has been heard by the audience many times, and the girl does this thing with her hand while moving her hand. The audience should have their suspense built, but instead everyone laughed. The Esposito character was annoying to me, she really overplayed her part by a whole bunch. In fact, she wasn't even that necessary in the film, which had about Four things going on at once.  The Finale was especially bad, but how one of the bad guys dies is a nice change of pace, a likable one. It also depends completely on time and chance. Then again, the movie threw credibility out the window  by the halfway point.  What really bothered me is that this territory has been treaded on before by lord knows how many movies. What I did like though, was how the wife was in the cast. But that situation ended simply in violence and with only a few startles.

Soon after meeting his patient Elisabeth(Brittany Murphy), his young daughter is abducted.  To get his daughter back, he must convince Elisabeth to reveal six important numbers that will lead the abductors to a jewel worth ten million dollars.  To raise the stakes, Conrad is given until 5pm the same day to do it. No problem!I can't help but be disappointed, because this could have been a really enjoyable movie.  All of the pieces were in place, a strong premise and good actors (Michael Douglas, Famke Janssen, Oliver Platt and Brittany Murphy who I had never heard of until now).  Unfortunately it also had every Hollywood cliche except for the token take time for gratuitous sex.  It could have been so much more.I was disappointed that a girl being so afraid and unstable in the beginning could be won over so quickly.  I don't care how charming Michael Douglas is (and he must be exceptionally charming to marry Catherine Zeta), the movie should have spent much more time with him struggling to get through to Elisabeth.  I loved watching her in the beginning with her I'll never tell that you've probably seen in all of the previews.  Unfortunately they spent too little time with Douglas and Murphy in combating roles, and too much with Douglas as her father figure.I also love Oliver Platt.  He is great in everything he does.  Unfortunately here he only does it for the first half of the movie.  Apparently he had somewhere else to be for the second half of shooting, because he was basically dropped from the movie at the mid-way point, along with his entire story line.  Use him or lose him, just don't do it half way through a movie!Finally, we have a cop who is a waste of space.  Take her off the screen, use that screen time to expand Dr. Conrad's time appealing to his patient, and then you'd have had a really interesting movie.Overall, it isn't a bad movie.

Well either way, these scenes didn't really tie into the rest of the film, that is until some out of nowhere plot points came up. 2 How did the people who kidnapped Michael Douglas' daughter manage to plant all those high tech cameras throughout his apartment, without waking him or his wife up? Neither of these questions are ever really answered and after awhile I didn't care much at all, but now when I think about them they still bug me a bit. But anyway, I will say this, Douglas is decent as the doctor and the film has a nice visual style. Now the bad stuff, besides the twisting and turning plotline, we have a couple of silly performances, one from Murphy, who just isn't very convincing and Sean Bean as the villain of the movie, who really does nothing more than sit around with his cell phone on his ear and threaten Douglas.  However, the actors don't deserve all the blame, the script, after a promising start, becomes just another silly thriller that tries to have a big ending that will supposedly make up for it's past faults. Well it really doesn't work here, the fight filled last 15 minutes don't really work since it just isn't very convincing given the actors involved. To sum up, a film with a bad beginning that quickly gets worse. *1/2 out of 4 stars.

The next day, Douglas goes to wake up his own little girl to take her to the Thanksgiving Day parade, and--dang!--she's been kidnapped.  No good deed goes unpunished. It seems that Douglas's new patient has, locked in her brain, a six-digit number that is the key to a gang of bank robbers' recovery of a ten-million-dollar ruby that got away from them when their heist went awry ten years ago. (They just got out of prison.) Since he is the presiding psychiatrist, they want him to get that number for them, or they will kill his little daughter. They give him until five o'clock that afternoon. Well, there goes Thanksgiving out the window. Why do they need it by five o'clock? No one ever says. Oh, I know--the time element lends suspense to the plot.Actually, it is a fun plot. If it were a comedy, it would be zany. Come to think of it, as an action-suspense-melodrama, it's...zany.

Fast-paced, with a little mystery and a few surprises here and there, but most of the time you will be drawn by the fact that you want to see how the ending was made rather than what the ending IS.The movie commercial lays out the story pretty much. A psychiatrists' daughter is kidnapped by some highly sophisticated criminals. The reason is that they want his skills to extract a number from the mind of a teenager. This number relates to a failed robbery they committed a decade before and they need the number that the girl memorized a decade ago so that they can get to their loot. The movie has a very fast pace. There isn't one scene that lasts more than five minutes. Not one long conversation or huge confrontation or any such thing. Which is probably the movie's biggest weakness. It's amazing the amount of detail that was put into creating the settings for the movie. As much time as the director put into looking after the tiny details in the scenery and the equipment the criminals have, he sure put little time into reviewing the story itself. Little effort is made to introduce some very key characters in the movie. For example, a key police officer in the story just POPS into the movie and starts investigating trails that lead her gradually to the movie's grand finale ending. Out of the blue no introduction of her character, nothing causes you to care about her in any way. She just marches into a crime scene and starts investigating right away.Still, the movie is a good thriller and there will be several times when you will be taken by surprise or be blind-sided by a trick the director put to rush adrenaline into your blood. And the bottom line is that's what thriller movies are about.

To me it appeared to be an exciting, high stakes thriller placing our hero under tremendous pressure to quickly solve a mystery in order to save his daughter from kidnapers.Sitting down to watch it I was preoccupied wondering what the secret of the number locked inside her troubled mind was. What did it refer to? What was contained there?Unfortunately, you find out what's contained there within the first few minutes; it certainly would have been much better if they hadn't revealed this. From there it becomes pretty easy to figure out the plot - the hero (in this case Michael Douglas) is coerced into helping the bad guys when they kidnap a loved one; the hero has a totally unrealistic deadline to meet in order to keep the bad guys from killing his daughter.. etc., etc. Substitute daughter for Kathleen Quinlan and does anyone remember Breakdown?Still, as is often the case with a well used theme, the individual story as well as superb acting make it worth your time to watch. Michael Douglas gives a strong lead performance and Brittany Murphy (Girl Interrupted and Phoenix) is very convincing as the troubled central character.

But, it's lacking two key elements thrills and tension.Here's the synopsis (yeah, my style is coming back to me now...)  Dr. Nathan Conrad (Douglas) is happily married to his wife Aggie (Janssen) and is madly in love with his daughter, Jessie (Bartusiak).  Conrad is a psychologist who is known for his ability to work with teenagers.  He's in his own practice now, but he used to work for the State of New York.  On Thanksgiving Eve, he gets an emergency call from one of his former colleagues, Dr. Sachs (Platt).  Sachs needs Conrad's help in reaching a girl named Elizabeth.  Elizabeth has been in institutions for the past 10 years, beginning shortly after her father died.  Her records show mental illness after mental illness &#150; post-traumatic stress disorder, paranoid schizophrenia, catatonia.  Not a healthy girl, but non-violent, until just the other day, when she nearly killed a man with a razor blade.  Without Conrad's help, she'll be drugged up and locked away for the rest of her life.  But, as Conrad soon discovers, she might be faking most of her illnesses.  He has little time to worry about that, however, as the next morning, he discovers that his daughter has been kidnapped!  He gets a phone call from Patrick Koster (Bean), and receives instructions.  Get a number out of Elizabeth's head, and you get your daughter back.  Don't say a word to the police.  None of this is a surprise, as we've seen the trailer for this movie.As I said before, this movie looks like a thriller.  But, it doesn't feel like a thriller.  Conrad is working under a strict timeline.  He gets Koster's phone call at 10 am, and he has until 5 PM to get the number. But, the pacing is all wrong.  I never got the sense that time was running out. Yes, a thriller should build slowly, but it shouldn't keep the same pace the whole way through.  It spent the right amount of time on the build-up, and then kept on truckin' at the same pace the whole way.  Which meant that you were able to spot the &#145;thrills' coming a mile away.The last half of the movie just felt contrived.  Yes, it's a movie, suspension of disbelief, etc., etc.  But, the unexpected should fit within the framework of the universe that the film creates.  Se7en worked because we believed in John Doe.  We didn't know how he was able to do what he did, but we believed he could do it.  Psycho worked because we believed that Norman Bates was just that insane.  We're given little bits of information about the antagonist's past (Doe's diaries, Bates' mother).  We don't get the same thing with Koster.  While Sean Bean is a good character actor, what his character is doing doesn't make sense with what we know about the &#145;world'.  Oliver Platt is a fantastic character actor, but he's mostly wasted in this movie.  And I didn't buy Murphy's portrayal of Elizabeth.Don't Say A Word isn't without its good points, however.  Skye McCole Bartusiak could go far, provided she doesn't take &#145;kiddie' roles.  There's something in her eyes that hints at big things to come.  Haley Joel Osment things.

I guess movie shrinks are rarely excitable anyway. Sean Bean, even when he plays a sympathetic role, seems built for villainous parts because the default setting for his features is a slightly mean frown. He must frown in his sleep.

He's great in supporting roles and didn't make enough movies.Brittany Murphy -- well, I have a problem with her. Not her looks or her figure. She's cute, tiny, and girlish, and when Douglas first meets her she sneaks a hand under her sweat shirt and asks him, Want to touch? I thought it was a highly artistic scene.

This stylishly-lensed, white-knuckled suspense thriller asks us to put up with a plot so contrived that it literally defies credibility. Basically, a gang of relentless jewel thieves abduct Jessie (Skye McCole Bartusiask) the 8-year old daughter of an affluent Manhattan psychiatrist, Dr. Nathan Conrad (Michael Douglas of Traffic), and holds her for ransom. The gang doesn't demand money. Instead, these calculating, cold-blooded, ex-convicts want our resourceful hero to ferret out a secret mired in the mind of an apparently catatonic, 18-year old damsel-in-distress, Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy of Summer Catch), prone to bouts of extreme violence. Our antagonists need a six-digit number, so they can locate a ruby worth $10-million. Elisabeth's felonious father abetted bad guy Patrick Koster (Sean Bean of GoldenEye) and his crew when they stole the gemstone ten years ago. During the getaway, Elisabeth's dad double-crossed them, stashed the ruby, and fled. When they caught up with him, he refused to divulge where he had the ruby, so they killed him, but were caught and imprisoned. Now, they are back on the streets again and after Elisabeth.Were this chain of events not improbable enough, remember these villains have just finished a ten-year stretch in New York's notorious Attica Prison, and they still want that damned stone! The premise of Don't Say A Word partially mimics the recent Martin Lawrence comedy Blue Streak, except Lawrence emerged as the hero, whereas Sean Bean and his ruffians are indisputably the bad guys. Originally, N.Y. Transit authorities arrested Koster and company for knocking off Elisabeth's dad in a crowded subway station while she witnessed his murder. Vividly ingrained in her mind is the memory that nobody tried to help her dad. Now, the only remaining lead these desperate hoodlums have to the whereabouts of the ruby is Elisabeth herself. Cleverly, she has managed to hole up in a variety of mental facilities over the intervening decade and eluded them. How can somebody with no medical expertise whatsoever dupe experts and stay in at least 20 institutions? Don't Say A Word never satisfactorily resolves this question. Nevertheless, Dr. Conrad catches her faking right off the bat. Deciding to come clean, Elisabeth warbles a tune like a mythical Greek siren trying to lure a sailor to his death on a rocky seashore I'll never tell. She knows more is at stake than her implied mental instability and suspects Dr. Conrad knows about her secret, too.Incredibly, our heroic psychologist finds himself up against a wall with a nerve-racking, eight-hour deadline to pry the valuable secret out of a reluctant Elisabeth before the villains kill his daughter. The outlandish but adrenalin-laced Anthony Peckham & Patrick Smith Kelly screenplay borrows elements from the Bogart classic The Maltese Falcon, the Martin Lawrence comedy Blue Streak, and the graveyard scene in Sergio Leone's The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly. Sadly, the writers don't do a seamless job of integrating different story lines, so a police investigation subplot appears added as an afterthought. Finally, our villains behave like larcenous Boy Scouts. They come up with every available audio and video surveillance device to make Big Brother salivate, and they install them wherever our heroes might conduct business. Like all encompassing evil, these fiends strive to be as omniscient as possible. They wire Dr. Conrad's luxurious apartment house and the grim mental institution where Elisabeth is held. The writers neglect to tell how these guys obtained their sophisticated equipment. Did they steal it? Or how they could gain access to an apartment complex with security guards? Don't Say A Word unfolds with a flashback set in 1991. Koster and his team of high-tech thieves break into a safe-deposit box at a posh New York bank and pocket a priceless ruby. At least, Patrick thought he had it, only to discover moments afterward that his slippery-fingered accomplice has pulled the old switcheroo on him. Eventually, they catch him in the subway, and Elisabeth's dad dies when they force him in front of an on-coming subway train. Later, after they get out of Attica, Koster and his cohorts track Elisabeth down in a mental asylum run by Dr. Louis Sachs (Oliver Platt of Bicentennial Man), one of Nathan's oldest and closest friends. Sachs accuses Nathan of selling out and moving up-town to earn the big bucks. Our wily villains strong-arm Sachs, and he browbeats the unsuspecting Nathan into accepting the poor girl's case pro bono on Thanksgiving Eve. Nathan's last minute favor for Louis ticks off his wife Aggie (Famke Janssen of X-Men); she is confined to a bed with her broken leg in a plaster cast. We learn Aggie broke her leg during an off-screen skiing accident. However, Aggie's infirmity doesn't prevent the agile Janssen from getting into trouble later on in the action. Aggie's no-holds-barred battle with one of Patrick's nastier henchmen is simply terrific! I'm not overly fond of kidnap capers involving small children. My chief complaint about Don't Say A Word is the little girl. First, we know nothing deadly can occur to her, because she looks far too cute and adorable. Second, you know her brave dad will save her, because Don't Say A Word is strictly a popcorn movie. Third, Hollywood doesn't make movies that show adults torturing children. As a result, this inherent lack of drama undercuts the suspense. Now, teenagers are an entirely different story. The villains can rough them up, but they aren't about to muss a little girl's hair. Only when the kidnap caper is a comedy along the lines of O'Henry's The Ransom of Red Chief, where the child creates more chaos than the adults can endure, do I like them.Ultimately, Don't Say A Word doesn't surpass director Gary Fleder's audaciously subversive debut thriller Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead (1995). Altogether, what Don't Say A Word lacks in authenticity, Fleder more than makes up for with gripping, edge-of-the-seat anxiety.

Don't Say A Word is an intelligent, suspenseful and well written movie. With his role as Dr. Nathan Conrad in Don't Say A Word, Michael Douglas has proved he still has the ability to charm audiences and continue to deliver great performances.Mystery is one of my favorite genres to watch on screen because it forces the mind to work. One of the requirements for mystery is to keep the villain's identity hidden; however, there are exceptions to this rule. When the identity is revealed early, I look to see how well the villain is doing at keeping the suspense alive for the audience.The utterance of Michael Douglas' name should be enough to convince them that the movie will be successful. I knew immediately when I heard his name mentioned in relation Don't Say A Word I recognized I was going to receive 110 percent effort, quality, reliability and success. Quality, credibility and reliability are three huge assets Douglas brings to each film he stars in; therefore, I'm confident every film will be successful.Don't Say Word has laid the foundation for Douglas to let everyone know that he is still in his prime. One common thread I found in Douglas' 35-year film career was the impact he made in each film he starred. For example films such as Romancing The Stone, War Of The Roses, Wall Street, A Perfect Murder and The Game, Douglas has been able to make the film better as he does with Don't Say A Word. Other attributes Douglas brings are charm, charisma and presence; three reasons why he is one of the best dramatic actors in Hollywood.Don't Say A Word involves a psychiatrist who must retrieve a six digit code from one of his patients, who happens to be the daughter of a man who stole a precious gem from his cohorts in crime. Douglas portrays the desperate psychiatrist who has eight hours to retrieve this six-digit code to save the life of his wife and daughter.Throughout Don't Say A Word, Douglas' performance brought back memories of The Game, because both are smart, clever and psychologically draining. Through his ability to draw my attention into the plot and ability to bring me into story brought satisfaction and convinced me Don't Say A Word works as a mysterious, psychological thriller.One unique quality that Douglas holds over his colleagues is the ability to convince the audience of his plight; a situation is most evident in his portrayal of Dr. Conrad. I could feel the intensity and suspense utilized for his role in this film. Douglas has a remarkable and tremendous ability to reel the audience in and make them a part of the film. When Douglas and other actors are able to accomplish this feat, everyone can be assured with the knowledge that he is the top of his profession as well as the movie he stars in will turn out successful results.As I stated earlier, Bean's performance in Don't Say A Word is played to perfection; however, I didn't realize how convincing was in the role. It is extremely enjoyable to watch films that contain actors who look their parts because it makes the film much more credible. I'm glad I got the opportunity to watch Bean in action because it is not often I see a convincing villainous performance. My only wish is to watch him star in more films, much more frequently because he is a huge talent.Brittany Murphy was the best thing to happen to Don't Say A Word because she brought this movie to life. Her role in this film should be used as model for future psychological thrillers because of her ability to capture the true essence of her character. Murphy portrays her character so well and close to reality, I nearly forgot she was an actress. Murphy will only travel one direction from her role in Don't Say A Word. This direction is up.The plot may be formulaic, but it is enjoyable to watch nonetheless. The emergence of Murphy, a well-written script and the ability to keep everyone in suspense are reasons everyone must see Don't Say A Word. Two thumbs up.

Patrick immediately kidnaps Nathan's daughter, forcing Nathan to attempt to get Elisabeth to reveal a secret number which will ultimately lead Patrick to the whereabouts of the precious gem that has eluded him.Yes, indeed.

Lets focus on the gem. Yeah, one question - all that for a gem, a bloody gem. Its got to be damn expensive and 10 years down the line. I can only presume after jail. But the flaw - wouldn't he have been sent to jail longer for the kind of murder of his stealing companion.Now, its not Michael Douglas who's the best. A decent performance nonetheless but no, its actually Sean Bean, who for some reason just seems to work. He's character, voice/accent or demeanor/face does the job to perfection.

There has been nothing like it. Obviously some people were not paying attention to the movie because there were a lot of obvious questions asked. Particularly Racegirl... Like there was a question about how the killers knew that she had a code in her head. They knew that after they had killed Elisabeth's father, that he was sent to Potter's Field. They also knew that he stole the ruby and had to have it with him. Secondly, the purpose of Oliver Platt's character was that the killers originally called him first, threatening his girlfriend's life. He didn't get the number in time so they killed her. THe whole reason that he was on the other side of the glass was so that if Elisabeth ended up giving Dr. Conrad the number, he would hear it and be able to call Patrick quickly. Thirdly, the cops were called by Cassidy and that is why they showed up at the Conrad's house. After Dr. Conrad took Elisabeth from the asylum, they sped away and she ran out after them. She immediately called other officers and told them that she needed them at his residence. Coinicidentally, the incident with Aggie and the other killer had just happened. And about the gunshots that Det. Cassidy was able to hear while on the boat... it was a pretty open and quiet place. I mean not many people are going to be at Potter's Field on Thanksgiving Day?! IT was basically only them there, so of course, something as loud as a gun shot is going to echo throughout a quiet place. The purpose of her role was important. Nathan was not supposed to talk to cops but she kept showing up and she worked HOMICIDE. hello? Not to mention that she is the one that saved Nathan's life in the end?! That is all I can remember as far as questions but that pretty much sums up most of them. So there ya go.

He could use a little more improvement, because at times during the movie, it could be easily determined that he was overacting. Also, Sean Bean was not exactly a perfect image of the bad guy, but a decent performance he did portray. Don't be discouraged to watch this movie, though; Murphy's role as a psychologically impaired teenager is pretty impressive.

He must find a way to get one of his patients (Murphy) to tell him a specific ten-digit number which holds its own a significance. She is tough to manage because other than the fact that she is a basket case, she insists that she does not speak of it; it is related to her own trauma and reminisces pain from her past.Don't Say A Word is worth your while, I recall recommending it to my fellow peers a few years ago, who subsequently loved it.

Having an unexpected day off work today, I trawled through my flatmate's DVD collection (she doesn't mind) and discovered that we had a disc featuring the great man. Sadly, it was a documentary he narrated on Jack The Ripper and having just finished reading Patrica Cornwell's book on the same subject, I instead plumped for this - a fast-moving thriller from the director of the enjoyable Kiss The Girls. Sorry, Peter.Don't Say A Word features Michael Douglas as a successful psychiatrist and family-man whose daughter is kidnapped by Sean Bean and his gang of jewel thieves. In exchange for his daughter, Douglas must enter the mind of catatonic patient Brittany Murphy and uncover a number which might lead Bean to a missing diamond (though it looks suspiciously like a ruby to me) he was screwed out of years earlier. To cap it all off, he has only until 5pm to do it and on Thanksgiving as well.As previously mentioned, director Gary Fleder directed the Morgan Freeman thriller Kiss The Girls and this film shares features of his earlier work. A lot of scenes are very dark indeed and it can be difficult making out what's going on. This film also moves at a cracking pace, rarely letting up the excitement or tension. Almost Hitchcock in nature, Don't Say A Word is a simple premise and proves once again that a good thriller needn't be dragged down by convoluted plot twists. There are a couple of plot holes that even I picked up on (how does Bean know about Murphy's number or even that it will lead to the ruby/diamond?) but these registered only a tiny impact on what is a well-shot and well-acted movie.Douglas and Bean are believable, as you'd expect but credit must go to Famke Janssen and Skye McCole Bartusiak as Douglas's wife and daughter, respectively. Having only seen Janssen in GoldenEye (which also featured Sean Bean as the baddie, coincidently), I must say I was surprised at how well she performed in a much weightier production than your average Bond flick. And despite my deep-rooted hatred of cute kids in films (I wouldn't see The Goonies again if you paid me), Bartusiak displays an unexpected maturity in the role. Only Murphy let the side down. Despite her praises being sang in the DVD extras, I felt she was behaving like someone pretending to have behavioural problems. The hand-shakes, the childhood songs - it all felt a little stereotypical to me. The real star of the show is the story as the audience, like Douglas, become ever desperate to discover the number and its meaning.Don't Say A Word didn't make a great impact upon release and that's a shame because it is a tense, exciting thriller that deserved better. Like Kiss The Girls, it is a competent thriller but one that never threatens to become greater than the sum of its parts. In Douglas, it has an Oscar winner. In Bean, it has a trademarked bad-guy actor and in Fleder, a director who has proved himself in other films. So why is this film OK instead of fantastic? Maybe this sounds a little harsh but don't take that personally. I had no expectations at all of this film (indeed, I barely remembered it being released in the UK back in 2002) but it is safe to say that I was pleasantly surprised. Don't Say A Word should have made a bigger splash instead of the ripples it did make.

The character requires a lot of emotion from the actor and Murphy is really ready to provide Elisabeth with that essential emotion, and her performance is the highlight of the film. It really shows how far Murphy has come since projects like Clueless.--There is some great suspense in this film. The majority of the scenes with Famke Janssen's character (is that woman hot or what?) are incredibly intense and had me on the edge of my seat. Another example of a suspenseful set piece was the scene where Douglas' character breaks Elisabeth out of the mental institution.--Gary Fleder shows some artistic flair, particularly during Elisabeth's atmospheric flashbacks.THE BAD--This film is too far-fetched. Some believability flaws are excusable, but Don't Say a Word is full of moments when the police could've easily caught the villains. This is very frustrating to watch the police not even notice. Also the villains of the movie who are watching Brittany Murphy the whole time have cameras and microphones connected to like EVERY set of the film. This is very unbelievable and leaves the audience annoyed at trying to piece together how these villains could've located a camera/microphone at so many places.--The finale of the film is stupid. It changes the entire story, doesn't seem to know where the hell its heading to and is plain lame and uninteresting.--Jennifer Esposito's role in the film was boring. I felt no sympathy for her character and found her annoying and overused in the movie.

Basically, when a movie involving a young girl in danger of being killed doesn't hook, and when said movie also involves mental illness, something's wrong.The shame of it all is that the makers have assembled a decent cast, though some of them are put to better use than others (Famke Janssen and Oliver Platt in particular are underused) - Brittany Murphy walks away with the movie as the young woman who's the key to the mystery, and the always-watchable Jennifer Esposito also gives more than she gets as a cop investigating a pair of (seemingly) unrelated murders; both help the movie seem better than it is, not least in a confrontation in the psychiatric hospital and a crucial scene set in a subway.Brittany Murphy fans will find this a must, and it's definitely superior to Mercury Rising, but those wanting to see a genuinely gripping thriller/character study with Michael Douglas should see Falling Down.

Strong performances and good production values can't redeem a storyline that asks us not only to suspend disbelief, but to relinquish our notions of reality.  That is all well and good for fantasy or sci-fi offerings, but this film purports to be a serious psychological drama in the Hitchcock tradition, and in that regard it is sorely lacking.Plot holes abound and the psychological aspect is glossed over.  Other than Dr. Conrad (Michael Douglas) and Elizabeth (Brittany Murphy) there isn't much character development.  I have to give director Gary Fleder credit for a fine job with the look and feel of the film.  With this film, Fleder has broken out of his predominantly TV resume to show that he has the ability to play in this league.  Fleder has a good sense for what makes a scene suspenseful.  His use of the camera is excellent, giving us some interesting first person perspectives in addition to scenes that were generally well prepared.  The sets are realistic (especially the Montreal subway station that was turned into the Canal Street station in New York) and well constructed for suspense with lots of places for tight, cramped shots that turn up the psychological pressure.  However, Fleder seems so intent on bringing us a technically well crafted film, that he misses the fact that his story is leaving the galaxy.Michael Douglas gives his typical fine performance; smart, tough and stubborn with a soft side.  However, the real story in this film is Brittany Murphy.  Murphy delivered an excellent performance in `Girl Interrupted' and then bounced around in a number of minor roles in minor films until landing this part.  Here Murphy cranks it up about tenfold as the disturbed, but brilliant young woman who has a secret locked in her head.  She walks a fine line between sanity and derangement and slips in and out so easily that it is frighteningly convincing.  She completely immerses herself in the role and gives what is, for my money, one of the best supporting roles of the year.Overall, this is a slick thriller that derails when a contrived story goes off credibility's deep end.  I rated it a 6/10 on the strength of the acting and some nice technical elements.  But, Hitchcock it ain't.

It seems to me that Michael Douglas once specialized in this kind of movies. Just think of movies like Disclosure, A Perfect Murder, Don't Say a Word,... they all resemble each other in one way or another.This time Michael Douglas is Dr. Nathan R. Conrad, a psychiatrist with a great wife, a lovely daughter and a successful career when he's asked to examine a disturbed young woman named Elisabeth (Brittany Murphy). But than something strange happens. His daughter is missing and he can't find her back. Soon he finds out that she has been kidnapped by a gang of robbers that want some information from his latest patient. If Elisabeth gives them a 7-digit number, they'll release his daughter, but she doesn't even think about giving it to him. But why is this number so important to these thieves? Well, they need it to find a rare gem which they once stole, but that they lost thanks to Elisabeth's dad.As I already said, this movie has really nothing new to offer. It's all very predictable and the story or the acting aren't all that spectacular either. Of course Dr. Conrad will do everything to save his daughter, absolutely nothing will stop him, not even a bunch of bad guys. Instead of fearing for his daughter's life, he tries to become a hero. Very nice for the movies perhaps, but not really believable. I'm not going to tell too much about it, but when you see it, you'll understand why this movie can be considered as a good pass-time on rainy afternoons, but definitely not as a masterpiece.

Movie viewers are already fed up with stereotypic portrayals of police officers (tough guys ala Andy Sipowitz) and attorneys (greedy lowlifes), so those responsible for this film should be ashamed of their simplistic, overly positive picture of psychology and psychiatry. Come on, the image of a happy, well-balanced psychiatrist gleefully cooking breakfast for his all smiles family rings a little too much like an after school special. This is only the beginning...it gets funny from here on out. The make-up artists made Douglas look like Krusty the Clown with all of the make-up they caked onto his face. Pink cheeks only work in cold settings. Is Douglas that worried about his advancing age? Finally (and this is probably just for the nerds among us), the treatment of what cognitive distortions are in this movie reminds me of the realistic depiction of military uniforms in many B-movies of the 80's.

Through a grey and gloomy filter camera, the story opens with a group of criminals led by Patrick (Sean Bean) botching their way through a bank heist. They are unable to retrieve the rare gem in the safety deposit box because of... shall we say, internal rivalry. Cut to 10 years later, an affluent psychiatrist (Michael Douglas) takes a pro-bono case on the deeply-disturbed Elizabeth (Brittany Murphy) and, when he gets home, his daughter has been kidnapped by Patrick and his gang. Why? Because they seek the 6-digit code that Elizabeth has locked up in her mind to unlock the deposit box...Decent concept, poor writing and even worse execution can best be applied to 'Don't Say A Word' &#150; a thriller that is so marred by formulaic elements that it would fall apart at analysis, which is ironic considering Dogulas is playing a psychiatrist who picks people apart in analyses every day. But his own character is embarrassingly flat. The film goes to great lengths to instill the 'family-man' image by tucking his daughter in, kissing his wife, cooking &#150; all is stable and well-off, patiently and peacefully accompanied by a cheesy orchestrated Hallmark-family-moment music. OK, we get it. Cut to another cliché the hard-boiled-and-coldly-professional-yet-still-sexy female detective who bosses around her male coworkers and face cases with blind conviction and dedication. Here she is rather aptly portrayed b Jennifer Esposito but falls flat on account of the stereotypical image and the clichéd 'emotional' development. I also need to debunk the myth that Brittany Murphy gives a good performance in the film as her wreck-of-a-character Elizabeth. She captures the twitchy hand gestures, the tuneless singing and the listless staring but she is disgustingly over-the-top in her approach.

Oh, and tapping his phone line and his cell phone, and....And how can a tiny woman in a full leg cast beat the heck out of a hardened criminal armed with a knife?  Twice?  And how does ancient, creaky Michael Douglas battle to a standstill a guy who looks like Sabre-tooth from X-Men? Oh, c'mon! I didn't believe it!Still, its fun and worth watching.

I respect the need of feel good movies for a society that tackles crime,abuse of drugs and alienation on a regular basis.However when I see the butchering of a good idea and a fine cast, solely with the purpose of making the movie more watchable for US audiences, I cant help myself to think that I wont be able to watch a decent, believable mainstream Hollywood movie in the coming years.Lets take this one for example;the polt starts extremely interesting and gribbing in the first half of the movie just to become totaly absurd and laughable in the second part.Actually, the movie itself is like two different movies in one. The first part is a pyschological thriller and the second part is actionish!.The movie is full of stereo-types(in addition some characters are so under developed we cant really name them as stereo-types,they are just plain extras. eg the characters played by Platt and  Esposito)It is also full of nonsense acts committed by the villians, a point which i dont intend to dwell on since it has been analyzed thorough enough by the other commentators.

Pros The pacing is high. Sean Bean is very good (as usual) as the villain, he is like Danger on two legs (excuse me Donald Pleasence for borrowing your line) and he lifts this movie to a higher level. Michael Douglas is always entertaining to see and it does not matter that he is always doing the same role (rich, powerful, competent Stand up guy). Miss lolita psychohead, brilliantly played by Brittany Murphy, is another character that lifts the movie, she appears to be so twisted it is almost scary. Don't Say a Word is also very well directed, apart from getting the best from the actors and the already mentioned robbery scene, the director has done a good job throughout, especially with the train scene and the ending who are very effectively staged. There is also some (not much) well done brutality in DSAW, apart from the initial robbery we have a brutal fight in an apartment.Cons OK. Michael Douglas has to uncover a secret from someone but other than that we have seen this story before. There are no unexpected plot twists. The female cop (Jennifer Esposito) was probably designed as an attractive woman in order not to compete with Douglas about who is the hero, but the character is hard to believe. Child in danger may be an effective theme but let there be more traumatising danger, let the child suffer from real danger with a gun in the mouth and it will be even more effective. Why does the movie children always have to be small, clever heroes? Let them be weeping, abused victims instead.Summary You will not be bored. The director has done what can be done with the story. If you want more story than this, watch the masterful A Perfect Murder or the unbelievable but entertaining The Game instead. DSAW will satisfy most audiences. Rating 7 / 10.

I enjoyed the whole premise of the film. In addition having recently been getting medical help for some mental troubles, I would not have minded having Nathan Conrad as my Psychiatrist.`You want what they want, don't you&#133; I'll never tell&#133; any of you'. These are the haunting first words the near catatonic young patient utters to psychiatrist Nathan Conrad. Her Name is Elizabeth and she has been institutionalized for over a decade&#133; but now she has viciously battered a man to near death; and unless someone can break through to her, she will be locked away in an asylum forever. Conrad senses more than just meaningless ramblings coming from this disturbed young woman &#150; she is hiding something from deep in her past. And the sheer terror of it is about to consume her. But what this young girl knows will cut Conrad to the core and tear his family apart. His Daughter has just been kidnapped and it is linked to the secret Elizabeth holds. What is the connection? Who is behind it? How can he break through psychosis to reveal the truth?This is a terrific movie. All praise has to go the people behind the scenes that got the right feel for a great story. Director Gary Fleder, who was part of a film that I did not find much enjoyment from, that being &#145;Fight Club.' Well he has won me over with this brilliant piece of cinematography. I like the mood that he created for the audience, in addition to how dark that this film was. Yet I feel that it was not too over the top. I have seen darker films, where it has ruined the feel of the film completely.I also like how the story of this film was brought to the screen. Again it was another movie that was taken from a novel. These days we are getting many movies that are like this, but when they work, I can not see any problem with that. The novel this film was based on was &#145;Don't say a word' by a novelists Andrew Klavan. It was a terrific movie, so I can't see why the book would be any different.The cast of this film was first class. Michael Douglas is a screen favourite for many movie lovers and I am no exception. He was great as Doctor Nathan Conrad, a loving father and professional doctor. This has been one of his better roles in a long time. Douglas is one of the better actors I have been privileged to see. Brittany Murphy, who was the other important link in the whole movie, played the disturbed mental patient, Elizabeth. Her role was so good in this that you would have to expect some sort of training, but from all reports she had no help, but acted just the way that everyone from the film wanted. It must be a special talent to be able to do that. I enjoyed her role in the other mentally based drama, Girl Interrupted. Again her role in that film must have been no challenge as she is a natural at that sort of role. In fact her role was not too far away from eventual Academy award winner, Angelina Jolie.Other cast members include comedy man Oliver Platt, who was also good in a serious role as Dr Louis Sach. In addition to X-men star Famke Johnson, who starred as Conrad's Wife. Then you have the role of the Conrad's daughter, who was portrayed extremely well by young actress and singer, Skye McCole Bartusaik. This girl has a great opportunity to start a terrific movie career and I hope she can do so. The bad guy of this film was English actor, Sean Bean. The audience I feel are at no stage meant to like him, but you also want him to get his way or the Conrad's could lose so much. Bean was good in his role on the popular, but in my view, the disappointing &#145;Lord Of The Rings'.This film has an interesting side to it, by fact that it has many different stories rolled into one. Firstly you have the bad guys, who are in a spot of bother after years of trying to change the past. You have the family of the Conrad's, which is important for viewers to try and be close too. Then the relationship between Conrad and Elizabeth, which is of most importance to the whole story. I like films that use this style of story, because it keeps people interested in a movie and makes you watch even closer.In closing, Don't say a word is the sort of film I can sit back and love to watch. I am glad that I did not have to go to any sort of psychiatric care, while I was sick, because it looks like a daunting place. We need to be more aware of people who have mental problems, because they are people that can bring much to the world we live in, if given the medical help needed. Look I can only recommend this film, but &#145;don't say a word' to anyone, please.Rating 9/10 or 4.5 stars "},{"Title":"Another formualic thriller","Date":"25 March 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Don't Say a Word **   Michael Douglas's latest thriller, Don't Say a Word is basically a tired retread on every other father in distress movie he's ever done.

The first part of the movie smells a lot like Ransom (Mel Gibson), but the rest of the movie doesn't play out as well.  Basically, Michael Douglas is the rich guy with the hot wife (Famke Janssen) and you're used to his performance in that role by now.  I mean, who else could play a character that drives a Land Rover in Manhattan?  Sean Bean is the evil Irish thug who terrorizes Douglas's family, and you're used to Bean in that role (Patriot Games).  With the main actors so familiar with their roles, you'd think that this movie would be a slam dunk, but you'd be wrong.I'll assume here that you've seen the trailer, so you get the plot with the kidnapping and the crazy girl (Brittany Murphy, who sure grew up since Clueless).  There's really not much to talk about outside the trailer.  When I watch a movie like this, I anticipate a few twists and a lot of action to keep me on my toes, but Don't Say A Word fails to deliver.  The plot is so straightforward it may as well be a documentary.  You won't be surprised by any of the attempted plot twists, and if you are, you won't care.  I spent the entire movie questioning the actions of most of the characters, praying that I was missing something.  The screenplay skips over key pieces of information, like how Bean's crew is able to plant video cameras and microphones in strategic locations all over New York City.  Instead, the writers focus on immaterial supporting characters like Dr. Sacks (Oliver Platt) and the ineffective NYPD.  We could have done without Platt's character altogether, and the police don't really get involved in any important way.  They show up at the end to clean up the mess and load the injured into ambulances.  We see too much of Janssen's character, and Bean's gang is about 2 members too big.  The producers could have saved a good 1/3 of this film for the deleted scenes feature on the DVD and the story wouldn't have missed a beat.There are some bright points to be made.  The movie isn't horrible, and I didn't fall asleep while watching it.  Is that a positive comment?  Anyway, Murphy and Janssen both look very good.  Murphy gets by playing the mental patient.  She could have used this role as a stepping stone to a nice little career, but something just didn't work right for me.  Douglas is solid, and he tries hard even though he can't carry the film.  Other actors might have mailed this one in a lot earlier, but he takes the role seriously and keeps this movie alive.  I rate it a 5 out of 10.

Here Douglas is Dr. Nathan Conrad, god's gift to psychiatry and the good life, with a beautiful wife, a darling eight-year-old daughter, an opulently-decorated apartment, and a thriving practice--so much so he does some pro bono shrinking. In short he is an all-around good guy, fabulously successful, admired by all.Of course in a movie these fantasy-world advantages might be a little hard to overcome. Usually heroes like this are the sort of pablum fed to artistically unsophisticated middle-aged execs so that they will have something to fall asleep to in front of their hotel room TV. I think this would have worked better if Douglas's character were a little compromised, maybe make him a womanizer or somebody who abuses his practice or at least cheats on his income taxes.The subject of his pro bono work is the catatonic Elisabeth Burrows played fetchingly by Brittany Murphy. In addition to being catatonic she is also quick with the multiple personalities and can job the shrinks to distraction. Enter the complication the girl holds some numbers in her head that some crooks want. They give Conrad until five p.m. to shrink it out of her or they will kill his daughter whom they have kidnapped. Right, this could happen. Meanwhile they have magically installed cameras in Conrad's apartment and at the asylum lock-up, god only knows how. Furthermore, Conrad's wife (Skye McCole Bartusiak) is temporarily bed-ridden because of a skiing accident. Every time either she or Conrad makes a move a phone rings and it is the bad guys (led by Sean Bean) on the other end saying Big Brother is watching and if you don't behave we will kill your daughter.Aside from the absurdities of the premise, there is the direction by Gary Fleder to consider. He might have made a passable made-for-TV kind of production if he had just played it straight, but no, he wanted to be creative (like Christopher Nolan of Memento fame, perhaps) and so chopped up the time sequence. Perhaps this was an attempt to camouflage the fatuous plot. No doubt Fleder and the clueless producers liked this because it allowed them to begin the movie with an inane action/adventure scene including a fire-balled vehicle and some authentic football-betting talk. After about twenty minutes of Huh? action, Fleder then allows the players to talk the plot and we realize that there are two time lines ten years apart. No doubt he also reveals how Bartusiak broke her leg, but I didn't stick around for that.Bottom line there are at least a thousand movies better. Pick one.

To make matters worse, his own daughter has been kidnapped by the bad guys and is to be killed if Dad fails to get answers. The film starts out like the Mel Gibson thriller Ransom (Douglas and his wife Famke Jansen even have a similar apartment, with a similar ledge overlooking the city). It then goes off along a Silence of the Lambs route, with a bit of psychologist versus pyschopath chit-chat and a hospital/asylum setting which reminds one very much of Dr Lecter's cell. By the end the film is in a land of its own, with a resolution that drags in a truly bizarre location.....an island graveyard called Hart Island just off the New York shore. The final sequence is quite overcooked, as seems to be the norm these days, and Sean Bean dies a suitably claustrophobic and unpleasant death. However, it also seems to be a rushed ending, almost as if the director and cast were fed up and decided to finish the project off in a bit of a hurry.

There's a feeling of Deja Vu that permeates many of the scenes (it reminded me a lot of the Fox drama 24). Yet, it's well done, somewhat exciting and there's some fun to be had. It came out with a decent score because this is, in general, a genera the produces a lot of junk and this movie is slightly above most. It delivers the goods as a diverting dull weekend entertainment. It's a you could do a lot better, but you could do a lot worse sort of thing. Positives The cast. Beyond the strong reliable Douglas we've got Famke Janssen (my Queen of Camp after Deep Rising and House on Haunted Hill)- she gets the most memorable fight scene in the movie.  Then there's the always good Oliver Platt, perennial hissing villain Sean Bean, easy-on-the-eyes Jennifer Esposito playing cop, and Luanne Platter herself Brittany Murphy. It's got a nice, easy to watch pace and looks good.Negatives Fairly unimaginative and dumb. Esposito's silly tough-chick-cop subplot feels like it's from a different movie entirely. It gave me bad flashbacks of Angelina Jolie trying to act tough in The Bone Collector. Murphy is often obnoxious, her purpose in the script is to scream and have fits and generally obstruct the plot. Nearly everything in the film is telegraphed early on. The master baddie has a pretty cool death scene, or would have if Fleder didn't beat us over the head with it (he thinks we won't get the parallel so he cuts to flashbacks from earlier- right in the middle of the action!). It's fully realized, but flies off it's hinges and looses all credibility in the 3rd act.

Thank God Douglas extended himself beyond action roles early on in his career. This is the kind of movie Mel Gibson needs to make, and in fact it bears some superficial similarity to Gibson's RANSOM. Not as good as THE GAME, better than A PERFECT MURDER. The ending sort of mangled things, but at least it is a game try at a deevnt thriller.

This movie is soooo predictable it's almost a shame to know that Michael Douglas is in it. I like Michael Douglas. I am not his greatest fan but I like him (esp. in &#145;Jewel of the Nile' and &#145;Fatal Attraction' both of which I thought he was perfect for). I like him enough to say that all of the other movies I have seen him in (and that's been most of his films), he gives very good performances. I like him enough to ask why he didn't read the script for &#145;Don't Say a Word' before he signed on? All the great performances in the world wont make up for this redundant stinker. I mean really. **Possible Spoiler but read on it really wont spoil a thing** Did anyone not see from a mile away that my boy Oliver Platt (why oh why???) set him up with the bad guys. Did anyone think after 10 minutes into it that the movie would not proceed and end exactly like it did? It could have taken at least one twist or one leap but it doesn't. It just plods on ahead like a train going straight through a flat featureless desert. I hope this is not a sign of things to come from Michael and Oliver. The movie wasn't bad in the sense that it wasn't made well. It's just been made way, way too many times. And I know Michael is getting up there in years but for God's sake cut down on the rouge! Enough Hollywood! We don't want to see this one rehashed again... again...again... That's all for this one. That's my take. What's yours?

The main reason I went to see it was because I wanted to know what the 6-digit number was.I'll start with what's good about Don't Say A Word...I didn't guess what the 6-digit number was. OK now on to the not-so-good.....Was anyone under any doubt as to how the film would resolve? Any at all? That's not good. That's a lack of suspense. Was there any point in the movie where you were surprised? I wasn't. How did this script take so long to perfect? It's by-the-numbers. For example we've got the boring trite use of security cameras to surprise us - Jessie Condrad (Skye McCole Barthusiak) is the wife of star Nathan (Michael Douglas). At one point she's hobbling around and sees the slumped body of her attack in her house on camera. But oh-my-god, the next time she looks the body has gone! It means he's about to attack her maybe!! Her character suffers similarly from being disabled (she's a broken leg) which means, automatically, that disability must come in useful somehow in the end (as opposed to being, as it would, only a 100% hindrance). But that's not all - there's no surprises anywhere. Everything is setup with a degree of contrivance that can astound. The plot's quite ridiculous and has painful The Night of the Hunter allusions. It becomes irritating until you wish to rattle the nutty girl, Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy), who has the number trapped in her head and damn well force her to reveal it...Everything here is so banal, it's almost movie-of-the-week affair. Douglas is doing his usual thing of rich-man-meets-wrong. His wife plays her part with a degree of hysteria that's much more amusing than the intended distressing. Murphy is credible as the disturbed patient, not over-playing the crazy angle, and is about the best thing in the movie. Sean Bean however, playing the villain who kidnaps Douglas' daughter to get him to retrieve the number from Murphy's head, is laughably hammy and seems to be camping up the scenes he's in. He's about as menacing as Winnie the Pooh, and I'm surprised his henchmen don't end up sniggering behind his back. And Douglas' little girl, played by Famke Janssen, is your typical smart-ass stock child #14. She's so boring that I'm surprised her family even noticed she had vanished....Oscar stuff this ain't.The directing is also bland. Nothing special, not too dreadful considering the source material that's been worked with, but Gary Fleder failed to get me on the edge-of-my-seat at any point because I could mostly guess what would come and, even if I couldn't, he had used a load of directorial clichés so as to make it obvious (such as the camera I mentioned earlier).It's not the worst movie ever. It's watchable fare, and will pass the time. It will also be completely forgettable afterwards and has nothing at all to make it stand out. Should-do-better. 4/10.

So what? The movie is fun anyway.Roughly every 10 years, I notice I've changed considerably. However, you know who hasn't? The villains in this movie. Somehow, magically, though arrested over 10+ years ago, they all manage to be released at the same time. They also, inexplicably, have been able to rig not only Michael Douglas' apartment but the hospital where he must treat a new patient (although in the beginning we're led to understand he basically sees only private patients & rarely goes to the hospital anymore). We're talking high-tech bugging here private & cell phones, cameras & 2-way communication in both hospital & home -- the whole 9 yards. But I digress. That part is not explained but who cares? It's a movie, dammit!I allowed myself to get caught up in it, despite incongruities & found it enjoyable; it even evoked quite a bit of tension along with the smirks.Douglas is good (but then I generally enjoy him). Brittany Murphy is fine in a role that easily could have gone over the edge. Sean Bean's a fine villain you wouldn't want to turn your back on. The cast, generally speaking is fine, although I was sort of sad to find the admirable Oliver Platt in a second-rate role -- he's far too good an actor to be here. But I guess he needed the $.Not great but not bad either.

Michael Douglas was good as he usually is. And I liked Britney Murphy in this. I wish she would have said I'll never tell a couple of more times. It was so creepy the way she said it.(SPOILERS)  My question is how did the bad guys bug the Conrad's apartment without them knowing. I take it the wife had been spending all her time at home with the broken leg, so when did they have time to put the cameras in the apartment?  And after the wife finally kills one of the bad guys and the police show up, why doesn't she let them in on what's going on.  Also, it is such a cliche to have the lady cop go to that island by herself.  Why didn't she at least have a partner when she found out where Conrad's SUV was.  And how did 60 year old Michael Douglas overtake 3 other guys on the island.  In real life, that guy with the tatoos would have smashed his head in.And Michael Douglas figures out where the doll was in less than a day. The bad guys must have been really stupid since they couldn't figure it out. And we have no idea how many times they tried.  All we know is they kept trying to get to the girl while she was hospitalized. (END OF SPOILERS)FINAL VERDICT  This is not a bad movie. It is OK.  If you don't care that the movie is sort of predictable, then it is worth watching. "}]
