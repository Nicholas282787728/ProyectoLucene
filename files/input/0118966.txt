However I was astounded by Keaton's dead on 'lunatic' performance in Desperate Measures he is bigger than life. In addition Garcia is quite the believable character as Frank Conner. Nurturing his son, Mathew through his debilitating illness and trying to cope with life and work despite the circumstances with his son. He is a fighter, a scrapper, who doesn't back down. Looking for a 'donor' for his son, searching and finally finding a match. Then he meets his match. A nightmare is about to unfold, here is a scrapper and a fighter, who kills and won't back down, either. McCabe is smarter than the average prison inmate. Keaton is full on and worse than even the 'pshycotic' renter that he played in 'Pacific Heights'. He is raw, at times caustic and most of all numb. If you look in his eyes, the only thing that registers from his pupils is 'Death'. He's strong and bound by a piercing determination. He is looking for a 'payback' for something or 'things' that have happened to him in his younger life.'Captain Cassidy', played by Brian Cox is worthy of praise. Cox always seems to add more color to everything that he's in. And as he looks like a 'fitting' candidate, he convincingly brings himself to the forefront. Again, once it looks good and everyone is vulnerable, Keaton's- Peter McCabe, focuses and attacks, leaving his surroundings and the area he was occupying, in a state of debris.

Thanks to a rainy day and a few hours to kill, I decided to watch this movie and it exceeded my expectations (which were not very high).I still would not say this is a great movie. In fact, it is pretty average but Michael Keaton gives an enjoyable performance as a hardened prisoner. Normally, I would expect Garcia to be the bad guy and Keaton to be the cop, but Keaton honestly works out better as the bad guy.The worst part of the movie has to be the kid, Matt, played by Joseph Cross. Nothing he says or does is what a young child his age would actually be thinking or saying. I am not even really disappointed so much with that, but his delivery was terrible. I know he is just a kid, but there are much better child actors who could have portrayed this much better. All in all, worth about a 7/10. "},{"Title":"Desperate.

He plays Conner, a cop with a son who needs a bone marrow transplant to stay alive. Enter Michael Keaton as McCabe, a mad psychopathic criminal genius (aren't they all?) whose bone marrow is a perfect match. What follows is an irritating battle of wits between Conner and McCabe, who decides he'd like to bust outta the hospital using nothing but a half-swallowed ampoule of a magical elixir, a dislocated thumb and a cigarette lighter flint. Move over MacGuyver.Garcia is particularly annoying as actor and character. His character is devoted to his son. Nothing wrong with that. Unless your devotion for your son means that EVERYONE ELSE'S life is meaningless and expendable. As McCabe tries to escape from the hospital Conner has to save McCabe's life many times because once dead, his bone marrow is no longer useful. Conner causes a cop to get shot as well as motorway carnage in his attempts to capture McCabe unharmed. I got increasingly more angry watching Garcia as Conner risk everyone he comes into contact with so that his son may have a chance of living. What about the rest of us? Don't we deserve a chance at life too? The Conner character seems to be rooted in the maverick cop tradition, playing by his own rules and deciding what is and isn't right. It's a world where a bully makes the rules and you follow them or face the consequences. Something along the lines of what happened in Germany in the Thirties...Garcia as actor is annoying to the extreme, spending most of the film tearing about the place in a semi-crouch with one arm stiff by his side for some reason. He trots out his usual bits of actor's business that appear in most Garcia films. He does the scene where he grabs someone's head in both of his hands and speaks/shouts right into their face. He does the scene where he explosively loses he temper and kicks some furniture only to immediately regain control of himself and instantly become the ice-man. He does the scene where he shouts in anger at the top of his lungs, while his face looks as if he has just spent an afternoon staring at the test card. You know the stuff. We've seen it all before.The film goes on for far too long and credibility is stretched time and again until even the densest viewer's intelligence is insulted. We're encouraged to sympathise with the Garcia character his wife is dead, his son's dying, he's a cop, he's pretty, he is a devoted father etc etc, but really, all he is, is a self-centred fascist bully. Keaton has to make flesh a one dimensional cliché of a character and he has a go but is on a losing wicket from the outset. How can you put a new and imaginative slant on the stock Mad Criminal Genius character? And Barbet Schroeder, what were you thinking? From the classic Barfly to this? Pity...

McCabe is a serious minded, multiple murderer who's I.Q. is in the genius range. Connor's is desperate enough to try anything to save his son and that includes releasing the prisoner from his maximum enclosure, long enough to extract the necessary ingredient while under the most stringent security measures available. However, despite the nearly impregnable restrains, McCabe is incredibly versatile, crafty and learns the weaknesses of his jailers, enough to exploit their mistakes and take advantage of their ignorance. From the moment the prisoner is removed from his incarceration, the audience is given an explosive, action-oriented and dramatic film which makes for a great escape. Keaton is magnificent and his role will surely make this effort a Classic. **** "},{"Title":"This was entertaining","Date":"18 January 2006","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" This movie, Desperate Measures, was....

Conner tries to convince, almost by begging, McCabe to help his son. McCabe will, but only if his demands are met.

That day, McCabe successfully escapes the operation room, and the rest of the movie is spent with Conner trying to capture the crazed McCabe without killing him, because he wants that bone-marrow for his son.Andy Garcia and Michael Keaton deliver good performances. Keaton doesn't overplay his role, although the trailers made him sound like he was a demon from Hell.

Now consider Garcia's dilemma he must stop his other colleagues from taking out Keaton, where meanwhile little son's condition is weakening. It's a great thunder show of explosions and shootouts, where Keaton has his humorous moments too. The car chase lead up, to a finale between Garcia and Keaton adds to the coolness of the movie, upholding the fun and excitement, which has been with us since Act 2. From the opening scene, the movie throws us right into Garcia's peril, where early in the film where father and sick son speak, I drew a few tears. It's really a well earned tear jerking moment.

Without a bone marrow transplant, Matt will die, but Frank isn't a donor. In fact, the only potential match is prison inmate Peter McCabe (Keaton), a psychotic but charming serial killer. At first, McCabe refused to participate despite Conner's pleas, but eventually, the convict relents and agrees to the procedure.

At heart, it's an action thriller--a chase picture.

Keaton knows what he's doing and he truly gives an Oscar worthy performance as Peter McCabe. I bet, if someone like James Cameron would have directed this movie, the rating would be a lot higher, and maybe... Keaton would have gotten an Oscar nomination for his role. The music fits with the action scenes, which are brilliant, and the ending makes you think 'I love it'.Bravo Michael Keaton, Andy Garcia and Barbet Schroeder.

But why can't he shoot him in the leg or something well let me answer that question, to be fair you did give this film an OK review but if you watch the film again. you will see that the first time garcia has keaton in his sight just before he slides down laundry shoot. you will notice that it is through a window he sees him, so he can't shoot his leg. the next time you see them together he has the knife to the nurses throat and drops his gun. then the next time they are seen together is near the end when keaton sneaks up on garcia and has a gun on him so garcia drops his gun a second time. then the last time they are seen together before keaton gets caught is on the bridge where garcia doesn't have to shoot him because keaton has nowhere to run. now that's a flaw that people always say when they see this film, and i just proved it to be wrong. i think if people watch this film a second time and give it a chance, they may well be surprised. in addition i have several friends who all think this is a great movie. with great storytelling, characters, action and direction this is a great thoughtful movie that i absolutely love, so if you haven't seen it go see it now.

I really loved this movie, but the first parts, when Michael Keaton was doing some strange stuff, was strange.  I feel that this film was judged way too harshly by the critics.  It gets a little unrealistic at times, but it is great.  It is about a cop (Andy Garcia) whose child is dying of leukemia, and he tries to find a compatible bone-marrow donor for his son.  The only possible donor is multiple mass-murderer Peter McCabe (Michael Keaton), who thinks of the trip to the hospital as a chance to break free.  In return, McCabe is let into the general population and is given smoking privileges. A great escape and he is free to do what he pleases in the hospital.  The cop must keep McCabe alive because if he dies, the bone-marrow is useless and his son dies.  There are some good explosions, and it doesn't just stop at the hospital, there is a car chase afterwards.  This film combines two great actors, but it is not Michael Keaton's regular role, a serial killer.  The plot is good and action is executed well.  It has a tip-top (excellent) ending and I thought it was great.  I give it a 9 out of 10.  McCabe plays some nice games with propane.

In sitting through this film, I honestly felt that I was watching Airplane!Take for example one of the crucial dramatic moments in which the zealous police detective (Andy Garcia) and the pediatrician (Marcia Gay Harden) are crossing over the skyway from one building to another. At that moment, Andy's character needs to get the doctor to his sick son who desperately needs a bone marrow transfusion that is to be provided by a killer on the loose (Michael Keaton). At the precise moment when the detective and the doctor are walking on the skyway, it is revealed that the doctor has a fear of heights! She then collapses into the fetal position as the detective helps her across the skyway. The film is filled with moments just like this one in which an intended serious scene turns to comedy.Take also the casting of Michael Keaton (primarily a comic actor) in the role of the psychopathic killer. Keaton has a mischievous charm, but not a killer instinct. I never once believed that he was capable of perpetrating any violence. The setting for the film was in San Francisco. Early in the story, we see the Keaton character being transported by armored vehicle from the high security penitentiary (San Quentin?) to a hospital in downtown San Francicsco. But after he makes his break from the hospital, it turns out that the prison is located immediately next door. This made no sense whatsoever in the logic of the film's narrative.The police officers in this film were especially wooden and even passive as Keaton's character seemingly took the entire San Francisco police force captive. Even such reliable character actors as Richard Riehle and Brian Cox looked ridiculous in their roles. In the end, the incompetence of the police officers was exceeded only by that of the filmmakers in this preposterous excuse for a film!

Keaton is a clever criminal who has bone marrow compatible with Garcia's son, who will die if he doesn't get the operation. Garcia is a cop.

This time around, it's simple a cop's dying child needs a bone marrow transplant and the only matching donor is a jailed killer.What follows is a movie that starts out on a fairly tense level before gradually become more and more preposterous as it goes on. It soon transpires that the killer, played with relish by Michael Keaton, is intent on using the opportunity to escape, and of course to take down anyone that stands in his way. Said cop Andy Garcia must do everything in his power to stop him.Much of the film involves a tense stand-off inside a hospital and it's during this section that it starts to get silly. Garcia does things like assisting a criminal to escape and driving his stolen motorbike through glass doors yet at no time do any of the detectives or police force attempt to apprehend him, preferring to let him get on with it.The plot gradually breaks down and in the end becomes one long chase sequence, filled with all of the over-the-top stunts you'd expect from a '90s-era action movie. The ending is both schmaltzy and expected. While Keaton is good value for money, I always find the staid Garcia a bit of a bore and he's no exception here. Still, if you take it for what it is - and you have a soft spot for laughably OTT direction and nostalgia for the late '90s - then DESPERATE MEASURES does contain a few nuggets of merit along the way.

Great cast, great director, stylish opening titles (that's becoming a lost art), and an interesting premise.Tonight I watched it. My jaw dropped, but for all the wrong reasons. In essence, Michael Keaton plays the Roadrunner, and Andy Garcia plays Wile E. Coyote. The big switch is that the coyote wants to catch the roadrunner because the coyote's son needs a bone marrow transplant and the roadrunner is a perfect match.Garcia's character is a police officer who very improbably arranges for Keaton to be released from prison so that the transplant can be done in a San Francisco hospital. Of course, complications ensue. Unfortunately, so does hilarity.It is admirable that Garcia's character, a widower, wants his child to survive. But after Keaton escapes he kills or injures dozens of police officers and hospital staff, but Garcia continually subverts attempts to capture or kill Keaton. As the Police Captain asks Garcia, How many people are going to have to die here tonight so that kid of yours can live?At first the film is entertaining. Keaton rightly realizes that the script is an improbable dud, so he has fun with it. But when he makes his big escape and slides down a laundry chute with a shock paddle in each hand to slow his fall it's clear that we've left the Earth's gravitational pull far behind us.It's good to see Keaton working. He's a fine actor who makes a lot of films, they just don't get released. But, good Lord, this was his next film after JACKIE BROWN. Is he that hard up for work?The much discussed in these pages ending, which I will not reveal, is predictable and even more unbelievable than anything else in the film. It's a perfect example of OK, smooth move, but what are you going to do now? What does NOT happen in the ending was that Garcia's son coming out from under sedation and speaking to his Dad in Keaton's voice. That's where the second star came from.Parents' note Violence, profanity, gore, and an unforgivable scene in which a gun is aimed at a child's head.Trivia note Later on Keaton starred in JACK FROST as a musician who neglects his family, dies, and comes back as a snowman. No, really, that's what happens. It's bad enough to count as a crime against humanity. The little boy who plays Garcia's son in DESPERATE MEASURES plays Keatons' son in JACK FROST.

And the reason is simple - characterization (believe it or not, believable story lines have never been a big concern of action films). Michael Keaton is both intriguing and creepy as the beefed-up Peter McCabe, a brainy, homicidal psychopath serving life in a maximum-security prison for killing four people, including a fellow inmate.  But he's also the villain you root for, based entirely on his charisma and likability (kind of like Hannibal Lechter).McCabe plays a life-and-death game with Frank Connor (played by Andy Garcia), a San Francisco police officer forced to go to `desperate measures' to find a compliant bone marrow donor for his dying son.  McCabe, as it turns out, is the boy's perfect DNA match.  When offered the genuine opportunity to help, McCabe reflects, `After all these years of being locked up, I'm finally given the opportunity to kill again.'' Beautiful!Connor haphazardly convinces his superiors to transport McCabe to a hospital, but the killer instead stages a resourceful escape, going on a destructive killing spree.  It's a bit contrived (blueprints of the building from the Internet, broken joints in his hand, anesthesia-prevention, etc), but all accounted for.  Under any other circumstances Garcia's character would shoot McCabe on sight, but in his current predicament, he tries to keep McCabe alive (if McCabe dies, his marrow is useless and the boy dies).As you can see, Desperate Measures isn't just about the pursuit of a psycho - the movie toys with the idea of morality and virtue, then tosses in a lot of antagonism to get the point across.  Still, it lacks a bit in presenting McCabe and Connor as the same person - each desperate with the capability to overcome and survive despite the chaos.

The idea is a great one, but the plot itself does not follow through. It's pretty unrealistic, and for a guy who is REALLY insane, Keaton's character sure is smart. The movies ending does not really follow the plot... which is probably why I liked it.If you are planning to watch this movie, I think it is worth it to watch it for the acting itself.

It's over-the-top to the point where you just stop caring.Garcia is better but tries too hard for a film that isn't up to par. Barbet Schroeder (at one time such a promising director with films like Barfly that amounted to pretty much nothing in the American market) directs well enough - I honestly thought the script was the culprit here...it's just a big mess.The film ultimately wastes a lot of good material, good actors and a good director - all because of a faulty script.

Film addresses how far a person will go to obtain, whether it be the cop who needs a bone transplant that only a criminal can provide or the criminal's escape to freedom but he is limited to the hospital. Shamelessly predictable with a cheap ending that plays like the final word of an argument. Barbet Schroeder often examines the dark side of human struggle but he achieved greater payoff with Single White Female to which the trauma issued is examined with two actresses who rise to the occasion. Michael Keaton as the criminal does the one logical thing and that is make an escape attempt but he will, of course, be won over by the kid and do the right thing before doing the wrong thing in the cheap ending. Andy Garcia as the paper thin cop who cares about his son and the success of this operation but tension rises when his kid is in potential danger. Joseph Cross plays Garcia's son who is more of a help to himself because he can sense Keaton's position. Marcia Gay Harden is reduced to being a damsel in distress that slows the movie down.

A computer search for a donor turns up only one match &#x96; Peter McCabe (Michael Keaton) a psychotic in who is locked away in prison for multiple murders. McCabe has to be a willing donor and refuses to cooperate, why shouldn't he, what's in it for him? After offering him privilege after privilege he relents possibly because he will get a better cell but mostly because he has figured out a blueprint that he has downloaded from the internet and has worked out a plan to escape from the hospital.That he does, and he goes on the run. Killing him might seem the alternative for the cops but it's not in the cards for Conner's son because McCabe has to be alive to be a donor. This puts into play an aggravating series of scenes in which Conner has to keep the police from shooting at McCabe, scene after scene of this.After having established Conner and McCabe and Conner's bright son up as intriguing, intelligent people and allowing us to care what happens to them it is disheartening to have to watch them turn off their brains and run through a series of kinetic action scenes and chase-capades. Michael Keaton and Andy Garcia have done good work in the past playing characters who use their brains instead of their brawn but watching their characters in action mode I kept clutching the arms of my seat.

For reasons that are never explained, a sociopath killer (Michael Keaton) is the only available bone marrow donor for the cancer-stricken son of a San Francisco cop (Andy Garcia), who must capture the killer alive after a laughable escape in a labyrinthine hospital. The ensuing manhunt relies on plentiful plot holes and ridiculous shortcuts (like Keaton's use of a surgical laser to cut leg irons, or accessing hospital schematics from a prison computer). Self-consciously shot in film noir style, the cat-and-mouse routine leads to a briefly impressive car chase, but the premise (which even the movie's original press notes described as intriguing, if unlikely) is based on moral ambiguity that doesn't translate from script to screen.

Half the time he pulls off amazing feats of grace under pressure (Barfly, Reversal of Fortune), and the other half of the time he crafts enjoyable if mindless fluff that stands one viewing well, two viewings passably, and pales by the third (Single White Female, Kiss of Death). Five minutes into Desperate Measures, I was convinced it was the latter; a day after watching it, I'm still not convinced it's the former, but I'm farther along the road than I was at that point.Peter McCabe (Michael Keaton) is a highly intelligent psychopath, a less likable Hannibal Lecter, whose bone marrow happens to be a match for the dying son of Frank Conner (Andy Garcia). All Conner has to do is convince McCabe to be a donor to save his son, and keep McCabe from escaping somewhere between going out of his cell and going back into his cell. Needless to say, that doesn't work, or it would be a very, very short film.Much of the movie's appeal rests solely on the head of Andy Garcia, one of the best actors in Hollywood right now, and one of the most underrated as well. He's not as engaging here as he is in his best roles (Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead, Black Rain, Dead Again, etc.), but his acting ability is enough to make the film watchable. Keaton seems constricted by his role, but one gets the impression that has more to do with the director than the actor himself. A number of decent minor roles also show up in the film (Marcia Gay Harden is especially pleasing as the doctor slated to perform the operation, who gets caught up in the whole mess).If plot's more important to you than acting, however, don't bother with this one. Each twist can be seen coming a mile off, and if the ending doesn't make you want to seek Schroeder out and smack him personally, I'll eat my review. Perhaps the most predictable thing I've seen in the past five years. Oh, well, you can't have everything. ** 1/2  "}]
