[{"Title":"Quote-Unquote Intimacy","Date":"10 January 2004","Score":"84 out of 87 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  INTIMACY is a demanding film. It attempts a very close look at human relations, first at their most basic and physical, then at their most nakedly emotional. The film is demanding also because of its blend of present time and flashback, and a because of a few frankly muddled scenes. It is a clear candidate for re-viewing. While Claire (Kerry Fox) is given her full due as a character, this is, in the final analysis, the man's story. Claire has denied herself physical pleasures in favor of what appears to be a contented family life. She has a devoted, if obese, husband and a son, whose own lives seem like satellites of hers. While she 'acts out' emotion on a small, amateur stage, they wait in the wings, encouraging her. She seeks out her liaisons with the glumly attractive Jay (Mark Rylance) for the very reason that they must remain anonymous. She, probably erroneously, wants to put intimacy into her life through sex, but she does not want to replace her life with it.For the even less happy Jay, things are drastically different. He has suffered in a seemingly loveless marriage. There are two sons to whom he is clearly a loving father. But there is a sense that real intimacy has escaped him. Sometime before the narrative begins, Jay enters into an affair with Claire strictly, at first, for physical reasons--their encounters are essentially silent, physically intimate, but devoid of true intimacy. His need for connection is seen in the strange scenes of confiding in friends whom he otherwise holds in contempt. To his friends, Jay repeatedly bemoans his impatience to end the liaison. Yet, one Wednesday when Claire does not show up, he is forced to confront actual feelings. Gradually, Jay comes to realize that he wants much more from this affair. After their next encounter, he begins to follow Claire into her own world. The resulting drama is the main portion of the film. French director Patrice Chéreau looks upon these characters with a complexity of vision and the candor available to an outsider. He understands both the value and danger of anonymous erotic encounters. Each succeeding sex scene in the film reveals less, physically, and more, emotionally, about the characters. For Jay at least, it is a process of self-revelation. After he enters Claire's world through an acquaintance with her husband, a strong sense of broken taboo, FAR stronger than that of the sexual affair, comes into play. Jay has crossed a boundary and both he and Claire will pay a price for it.Kerry Fox is alert and brilliantly self-contained as Claire. And Timothy Spall (as her husband) gives a memorably detailed performance. Both must deal with betrayal and pained resignation. While Alistair Galbraith and handsome Philippe Calvario populate Jay's abusive, tortured universe.But this movie really belongs to Mark Rylance. His characterization of Jay astonishingly combines venemous self-loathing with a profound psychic woundedness. The performance is incomparable in the most literal sense. This is a brand of tortured character we have not seen so nakedly before. Jay's final moments on screen should haunt most viewers long afterward.INTIMACY is a surprisingly compelling film. Surprising, because a viewer may expect only to be titillated, or perhaps to be bored. This is not a film for everyone, its themes touch on difficult and painful truths about life. Those looking only for entertainment or eroticism will certainly be disappointed. Highly recommended "},{"Title":"Well Acted Drama","Date":"28 June 2003","Score":"54 out of 59 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  'Intimacy' is a very well acted drama, set in London. Jay has left his wife and son a year ago, and lives a disordered life, working as a barman, and carrying some ambiguous relationships with a couple of friends. He meets weekly a woman, Claire, with which he has a pure sexual affair, without any communication, a la 'Last Tango in Paris'. Things start to go wrong in this affair, when apparently involved he follows and finds out the background of the woman, and befriends her husband and young son. The film is not easy, and sometimes the border between complexity and confusion is crossed. However, the acting is so good that the characters are just alive. Life is confusing as well many times, after all.The film has many explicit sex scenes, and they have their place in the story line. This film is to a big extend about communication, and sex is the main way of communication between Jay and Claire for much of the film. Will this be enough to sustain their relationship? Well, go and see the movie and you will find out. 8/10 on my personal scale.

This film does that in many ways.

Whoever trains British actors gets my undying admiration. Mark Rylance gives an understated performance that simply thrills a person with its reality. Anyone who knows the work of Mike Leigh (Secrets and Lies) will want to see this movie. All of the actors give performances that rate highly with me. Imagine a scene where actors have to pretend that they are in an actors training session and they are supposedly doing improvisation. How would you script this? Could you script this? It's marvelous to watch.As the plot advances the dialogue is spare. A sign of great film making in my view. The camera work and editing provide the clues as to what is transpiring. At the heart of the movie, the tables turn in an unexpected way that leaves the viewer breathless. You almost have to stop watching to consider all of the implications of what has happened.Sure there are some strange inexplicable events, but that's life isn't it? So based on boldness, superb acting, amazing realization or direction this film will shock and satisfy, puzzle and pique your interest. One of the greats to emerge from the new realist school of European film making. Along with Romance and Blais Moi. Finally film making that looks at sexuality in an adult way and doesn't get coy when the actual act of sex is depicted. I delight in seeing films that are brave enough to illuminate the act of sex, after all it's what most humans are designed to do.

Intriguing while it focuses on the obsessive sexual relationship between non-committal Claire (Kerry Fox) and embittered, divorced Jay (Mark Rylance), the film tends to lose its way as more characters and situations are introduced. Shot, with a lot of hand-held camera, in Jay's untidy flat, in crowded bars, and in busy South London streets, about the only visually beautiful frames are those showing Claire's and Jay's intertwined naked bodies, relaxing after their frenzied love-making. Meeting once a week, and hardly speaking to each other, both Claire and Jay seem to be satisfied with little more than sex; but his curiosity takes over, he begins to follow her, and is resentful and envious when faced with the realisation that she has a life of her own and may simply be using him. The movie explores questions such as - how far can sex alone can take a relationship; and do words add to or detract from love? Another theme is that of role playing, on the stage and in life.         Both Fox and Rylance are superb in their scenes together; and Timothy Spall is excellent as Claire's talkative, down-to-earth husband. But I confess to finding Claire's friend Betty (Marianne Faithfull) a baffling character.  Some sequences, particularly those involving Jay's friend Victor (Alastair Galbraith) and gay French barman Ian (Philippe Calvario), seem simply to be padding. Possibly, Chereau felt the need to insert personalities and scenes from Kureishi's books, even though these were not relevant to the central Claire-Jay situation. Finally, yes, the over-hyped explicit sex is necessary for the movie to work.

This can make for difficult viewing, requiring an inordinate amount of concentration to keep up (and which wears you down after a while) and it only sinks in long after it's over. But that's the film's strong point the writers prefer to have you draw your own conclusions, with dialogue that forces you to read between the lines of an affair in which both participants seem to be using it to address their individual demons. Chereau and Kureishi are more interested in their characters' circumstances than their actions but it's precisely their circumstances that make their actions compelling. Mark Rylance and Kerry Fox are the lovers (and they're excellent, even though the fact their trysts are presented in explicit detail may overshadow their performances), with Rylance as a bitter bartender who has spontaneously abandoned his family and Fox as a drama teacher stifled in her marriage to a cabbie (Mike Leigh favorite Timothy Spall, also very fine) whom Rylance befriends in an attempt to understand her; it's the tensions that build around the trio that drives the narrative. It's an unhappy yet sensitive film that may distance some audiences and push others into uncomfortable areas they may not want to visit, yet there's no denying its inquisitive, intelligent presence.

Unfortunately, some things should never be told or wanted to discover. No words should be spoken. Here, intimacy is to acknowledge only with body and never with the mind.

Harsh, explicit and uncompromising, this film hardly welcomes with open arms. In fact nobody in the London as depicted seems to even dare to open their arms, except the two main protagonists, and they dare not open their hearts. It is in many ways a desperate and cynical film but unfortunately the squalor and general air of intolerance is only too familiar. There are, however, glimpses of the humanity beneath the surface that enables a city like London, the people of a crowded, selfish city like London to relate, however briefly, however seemingly meaninglessly, to each other. We do not live in times where there is too much time (or opportunity) we must grab our pleasures, indeed our needs when we can. Desperate, yes but uncaring, no and indeed a most ambitious attempt to illustrate the true nature of many relationships and the struggle for freedom and gratification when everyone is cheek by jowl and in direct competition.

Story is about Jay (Mark Rylance) who's a divorced father of two boys and now is head bartender in a popular English pub. Every Wednesday afternoon he meets Claire (Kerry Fox) and the two of them have sex but do not discuss with each other who the other person is.*****SPOILER ALERT***** Claire stops coming by on Wednesdays and Jay starts to follow her around and discovers that she's an amateur actress working in a play in the back of a pub. Jay enters the establishment and views the play and actually meets Claire's husband Andy (Timothy Spall) and starts a friendship with him but after a few visits it becomes apparent to Andy what is going on between them.Patrice Chereau is an actor/director/writer and has worked a good deal in the theater and there are several scenes that take place with the actors that appear could have fit well in a stage production. The story takes an angry approach to it's characters as their portrayed as people who just cannot commit completely emotionally and while as interesting as that is it's hard to feel one way or another for those involved. In Closer we don't feel remorse but we do understand (and feel) their pain and anger but here the story tries so hard for the viewer to know how distant these people are that it ultimately becomes impossible to have one feeling or another. Spliced into this film are some pretty good performances and while Rylance shows he can carry a picture it's the always reliable Fox that is easier to identify with. Arguably the best performance comes from Spall (Secrets and Lies) who shows us a character that has good instincts but after all the years of marriage finds out that his wife is terribly unhappy. Chereau presents us with characters that had real potential but the script fails in terms of allowing the viewer to be interested in their struggles.

The acting was very good overall, especially the leads, as well as the jilted husband. The movie is rightly rather gloomy and drab, and the cinematography set up just the right mood.  I share the feeling of some of the other reviews that the movie was too long and did not fully draw us into the lives of the leads. I wanted to know more about these people than the movie supplied. I started to get bored around an hour into the film, though a few scenes really drew me in late in the film.  Overall, I would say the film had some good intentions, but did not fully carry them out. Finally, the graphic sex did add to the film's themes (the search for intimacy, the inability to find it, and the desire at times not to have it), but since the film did not truly fulfill its potential, they too felt a tad bit lacking.PS Someone belittled Kerry Fox, the female lead, as not attractive as a potential French actress would be. It might be a question of taste, but at times I personally find French actresses overrated in that department, and furthermore, Fox provided a quite real example of sexuality.

Actually Chereau first read a french translation of Kureishi's novel (he did not speak english then  he learned it because he absolutely wanted to shoot the film in London, thinking - and he was right - that Paris was totally inappropriate to render the harshness of the characters'environment) and then he called Kureishi on the phone to tell him that he wanted to make a movie partly based on his book. The writing of the scenario was in fact led by three people  Kureishi (who brought to Chereau one of his short stories from which the sex scenes are actually derived), Chereau and Anne-Louise Trividic. Chereau and Kureishi have both said (lots has been written in the french press about the movie) that the WRITING of the screenplay (Chereau based half of his career on directing theater plays, he is very famous for that too  made huge things for the Avignon theatre festival) was very much of a by six hands played piece of music. Meeting constantly for the 4-5 years that the Intimacy enterprise lasted, Kureishi and Chereau became friends but Kureishi saw nothing of the movie until it was practically finished (you can find an interview from him on the Le Monde web site). He said that the film was a perfect depiction of London and of its harshness (that, by the way, does not appear that much in the book Intimacy for there the social background of the characters was much healthier) and that he was at the same time totally in awe and appalled by the final result, which in his view demonstrated that the film was really the product of a total cooperation between him and Chereau. In short, as said Chereau himself, Intimacy is really a child of what is called European cinema, where an English man transmitted his view of London to a French man and where a French man succeeded to tell a story of passion in a language that was totally foreign to him before.

Filmed around Elephant&Castle it gives a straight-to-the-bone portrait of London-life as it unfolds itself for most 'real' people. Anglo-Pakistani author/director Hanif Kureishi has a track-record for being able to portrait britishness and in particular London-ness with a true honesty that rarely makes it to film. INTIMACY thus pulls on many of the same strings as the recent wave of dogme films, but uses the best of dogme - its heartfelt realism, relevant script and believable actors and does otherwise not shy away from other 'proven' narrative elements like e.g. a string score.  The result is a film that asks to be seen repeatedly. The more so if you are from/have lived in London's south or eastside. INTIMACY is a must-see, and a worthy representative of (mainland?) european cinema (INTIMACY's graphic sex might be why Kureishi had to travel to France to get the film produced?).INTIMACY is by the way loosly based on Hanif Kureishi's book of the same name and a synopsis can be found on amazon.co.uk "},{"Title":"Raw movie about mid life disenchantment","Date":"8 February 2011","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Intimacy is a European co-production directed by French director Patrice Chereau in his first English speaking feature, also set in the UK. The script is based on two pieces by writer Hanif Kureishi the book Intimacy, and the short story Nightime.Intimacy tells the story of Andy, a divorcée bartender who meets Claire at his apartment on Wednesday to have sex, no words involved... until they start to click emotionally and Andy starts following her to know more about her.Intimacy is a soaring and raw movie about mid life disenchantment, and the need of physical contact to built emotional one.The film has been controversial due to the presence of explicit sexual scenes. However, reducing such a good film and story, to just the sex scenes is intentionally misleading, moralistic, and completely unfair to a story that presents many of the problems of middle-agers in a honest and raw way abandonment, divorce, loneliness, the feeling of being lost and emotional empty, the sense of not going anywhere in life, the trouble to fulfill your responsibilities as an adult despite being all messed up in your head and soul, fracas and rejection, unhappiness and hope. All of this is beautifully blended and portrayed in the film.The sex scenes are very strong, very demanding both physically and emotionally, simulated most of them, but very convincing as they really and feel very real. The viewer gets the impression that is watching a real couple having sex. The sex is always raw, and goes from almost brutal to sweet, from hungry to delightful, from anxious to comforting, with all the body language and emotions associated to different emotional states. Being so, the viewer does not feel aroused by the images, but sad and anxious about the couple being so needy of contact, and so unable to contact. The sex, in that sense, is a proof of the soul and feelings of the characters, not a dirty thing. In that regards, the film creates a clear line between what sex is not, and sets a clear boundary with porn, despite the fellatio in the film being non simulated, which is portrayed as a sweet moment of sharing and not a as woman mechanically sucking a man off for his own pleasure and as a sexual slave.The mood of the movie is great, with a mix of night and interior greenish/yellowish depressing scenes and warm and luminous ones. The art direction is great, as well as the music.The performances by all actors are terrific, convincing, powerful, and masterful, especially the leading couple Mark Rylance as Jay and Kerry Fox as Claire, in two roles that are extremely demanding both at a physical and emotional level. The supporting actors are also good and convincing Alastair Galbraith as Claire's husband Victor, Philippe Calvario as the gay bartender Ian, Timothy Spall as Jay's drug addict brother Andy, and Marianne Faithful as Claire's friend Betty, among others. Although Galbraith is always terrific, I don't think he was the right person, physically, for his character, as it is difficult to believe that Claire would be with this sort of guy, to be honest.A very sad movie, not easy to watch, with confronting images and themes, moving at times, with a very powerful story, wonderfully performed and directed. Abstain from viewing if you are a puritan, as you will only see the sex.

Already winner of notable awards at the Berlin Film Festival, including Best Actress, it could be set to offer Kerry Fox an Oscar nomination. In the French Cinema Verite tradition, the story looks at the ultimate bleakness of a purely sexual relationship where the two participants meet only for sex and know hardly anything about each other. From an initial kitchen sink drama level it opens out into a more colourful world where we see the two main characters in the context of their individual worlds. The characters feelings have, by this time, developed for each other, but without any knowledge or understanding of their respective lives. A scene involving an acting class seems to comment not only on how we can compartmentalise our lives in this way but raises questions about acting, in art and in real life, and also on the boundaries of intimacy and censorship. Intimacy pushes the censors boundaries in this film, as have a number of recent French films - the graphic inclusion of genitalia and oral sex being the issues here for British cinema, which have been passed uncut. The movie is neither titillating or gratuitous, so cuts, it could be argued, would have been morally abhorrent. The transformations Kerry Fox undergoes are emotionally powerful - I still felt shaken by the time I got home from the cinema.

I mean real drama. I mean the kind that is designed to turn you inside out rather than merely distract you from anything real. I think this is real. Its clearly meant to matter and designed so. Everyone involved is committed. The actors slightly cross that line about showing sex and therefore let us know that we are meant to take this as real, as intended. And we do.I'm sure it works for some viewers. It didn't for me, and I think the reason is simple. I'm not British. There are three main characters here, involved in a triangle, the tentativeness and purpose of which forms the spine of the story. But they are surrounded by others. Men with men and women with women. These characters I think are meant to define a sort of broken world, a sort of disordering set of forces in which our three are situated. So they are quirky, exaggerated, and because I'm seeing traits that I only see in other British films, they seem to be templates and therefore unreal. They seem to be from a store, that same store where you get eccentric secondary characters for romantic comedies, or that Bristish twist, the self- absorbed Trainspotting genre.This ruins the whole effect for me, because they may be real people, but they live in an unreal world, so the story doesn't matter.But there is one thing about this that is remarkable. Its the construction of the narrative.Remember that the whole thing depends on us getting the message that these actors are committed to being real? Our focus character is a woman who is an actress, trying to be real. More, as she in the movie is intent on showing us how to be real, she plays a character who is not only an actress with similar aspirations. But she has a job showing other less talented actors how to do the same. Its a really cool narrative fold. The problem with folds is that they are usually outside the narrative, a sort of metanarrative that declares the movie is fake. But you cannot really get much away without folding these days. So this writer has folded directly and openly within the story in a way devised to move the metanarrative away from outside the film to coming from within. Its a character folding, not an actor.Even though this did not work for me, it might for you. And this very clever engineering of narrative makes it worth watching.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

As it happens, her significant other, and father of her baby, is a writer with The Prospect who wrote up his reactions, prompting a film critic's response on reel vs. real love-making. I was surprised in advance that the American reviewers barely noticed the scene -- until I realized that the U.S. version, even unrated, is one minute shorter than the European version -- and I saw that it's absolutely obvious what minute is missing.Here, unlike the usual frisky sexual encounter movies about twenty-somethings, what makes this movie so powerful rather than voyeuristic is the mature theater actors playing experienced grown-ups with individual histories. The actress makes a point to go to interviews about the film accompanied by her nursing infant and babysitting mother and the images in the movie of trusting children are effective counterpoints to their parents' actions. Significantly, the emotional climax for the characters comes when they are both bundled up in coats. The point of the friends' roles are a bit unclear, especially the young, handsome gay confidante who mostly seems to be pitying breeders, but it's nice to see Marianne Faithful as rooted in reality. The soundtrack pounds out the electronica regrets of the central male character's former life as a musician, but his existential actions and self-realization are straight out of Bruce Springsteen's Hungry Heart.(originally written 11/22/2001) "},{"Title":"depressing but intriguing","Date":"16 April 2005","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Intimacy's title is an ironic joke; this is a movie about the lack of intimacy.

There is a woman, Claire. She shows up at Jay's door, Wednesdays at 2 PM. We don't know anything about her at first &#150; just that once she's in his apartment, her clothes (and his) come off. The five to ten minutes of intense once-weekly sex on Jay's apartment floor is no less important for being quick and wordless; it is a sort of a pact between the couple, and their shared illness, really. But it can't, ultimately, do the trick, and the film succeeds - unmoralistically &#150; in showing us how and why. The urge to find either oblivion or ecstasy &#150; whether via alcohol or sex or other means - fuels the couple. There are amazing surprises along the way, via a script that is utterly believable and natural. In fact, every aspect of the protagonist Jay's life is in fact shown harshly, graphically, whether it is his hectic job tending bar, his messy, depressing apartment (further evidence that he has lost his moorings), his several friends, or his frantic travels through London. (The camera chases him, and he is chasing her). We're by turns frustrated, confused, and focused. One's attention never wanders during this story.Children (Jay's and Claire's) are used well in this film. They can tell the truth, and they do. They use the word love &#150; and the adults in this movie really can't. In several scenes Jay is at his ex-wife's apartment, bathing his beautiful little sons.

Your first thought is liable to be a red flag This is going to be one depressing flick.Then as the plot develops -- hard as it is to follow in its details -- we come to know them surprisingly well, the two of them. Rylance takes on a certain pathetic charm with his scarred eyebrow and occasional stutter. And Kerry Fox lets her hair down, literally, and we can see the self-knowledge and the desire in her big blue New Zealand eyes. They become likable.In many ways the most admirable person important to the story is Timothy Spall as Kerry's husband, the Hitchcockian cab driver. He's not particularly bright and he trusts people a bit too much. And, man, he looks unprepossessing. But he's gregarious, generous, good-natured, and as harmless as a child. When he discovers that Rylance and Fox have been boffing each other, what does he do? Does he pick up a gun and spray lead. Does he do a plastic-surgery number on Rylance's face? Nope. He goes round to Rylance's bar, has a beer, and tells Rylance that he loves his wife. And that every day he loves her more. Later, when Fox prompts him to ventilate his anger over her affair, all he can come up with is something like, I don't care about that s***! What really bothers me is that you're a lousy actress and will never be anything else! When he's done shouting, she replies, You don't even know how to hurt me. There are other characters in the story too -- children, an ex-wife, somebody named Victor with a Scots accent, and a gay French bartender who philosophizes a lot. (I wonder if the writers had a particular model in mind.) Next to Kerry's husband, the French guy is about the most articulate of the bunch.But that's the problem with the movie. I was frankly lost at times. I honestly don't know how Spall's character found out about his wife's affair. Evidently she confirmed suspicions he already had, but since the scene doesn't appear on screen we have to guess. In fact, if the love scenes are speechless, the rest of the script isn't much better. More than once a character says to another, I can't understand a word you're saying. Sometimes I couldn't either. We shouldn't be gay because someone died. Nobody died. I died once. It was the only day I could tell the whole truth. I think we're in Last Year at Marienbad territory here. A shouting match between Rylance and Kerry in the basement theater made no sense to me at all. It reminded me of my marriage.I recommend it though. It's a rare movie made for adults. It's a challenging drama about lives that are either half empty or half full, depending on how you look at them. The ending is sad, but we are at least left with the hope that these characters can mend their tattered lives and get on with things.

But I was sorely disappointed. I am a divorced man who lived through the miasma of dating before remarrying. I wanted to identify with Jay (Mark Rylance). After all, he is an average-looking Everyman trying to cope with loneliness in a cold world. The crude and cruel circumstances under which he chooses to live, however, make identification impossible. It is hard to identify with squalor. Yes, I know the squalor of his cold-water flat symbolizes the squalor of his soul, but if we are to identify with someone like him we must see him struggle against such deprivations. Jay seems to embrace the filth of his life and seeks to spread it to others, beginning with Claire (Kerry Fox), the woman who drops by each Wednesday to have quick anonymous sex, and continuing with her husband (Timothy Spall).The film fails on several counts. First, it is far too long for its subject matter; the 120 minute running time includes five sex scenes and WAY too much talk. (Once, judging a literary competition, I read a 60-page story about two men sitting in bed, eating grapes and whining about life; this film brought that piece to mind.) Second, there are too many extraneous characters. Jay's friend Victor, his co-worker Ian (the only pretty person in the film, according to my wife)and Claire's friend Betty serve no real purpose. Sure, Victor shows us someone even worse off than Jay, and Ian philosophizes too much for his age, but neither man adds texture to Jay's life or the film. Betty is too dim to brighten Claire's life. Only her husband Andy has anything pivotal to say to her.The sex scenes, while certainly explicit (including a much discussed three seconds of fellatio between mainstream actors with other mates in real life), are strangely devoid of eroticism. The characters say little or nothing as they rut like weasels on the floor of Jay's filthy flat. Of course, all that is intended to show their lack of intimacy, but the Scarecrow would understand that symbolism before starting off down the Yellow Brick Road. (It is an irony worth noting that while Rylance and Fox are acting the parts of uncomfortable casual lovers, they must have reached some level of their own intimacy to portray people unable to attain it.)A better film would have told the same story in half the time with three principal characters and no sledge-hammer symbolism. His flat needn't have been such a stomach-churning mess, and even people who meet only for sex do engage in conversation and laughter. Someone who pulls on his or her clothes and flees, as Claire does, is unlikely to be let inside on the next visit. Ask any adult. Most of us have been there, in a casual relationship that one party eventually wanted to be more or in bed trying to overcome discomfort with small talk. Jay and Claire aren't even trying. Intimacy fails because it asks us to recall our own lost relationships and identify with characters and circumstances too far off the scope of our own personal radar. For all it tries to say, it actually says so little.Gary Earl Ross "},{"Title":"Last Tango meets 91/2 Weeks, with British accent","Date":"4 December 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  He's good.

Conversely I don't think that Marianne Faithful brings anything to the film. Spall's cab driver is ill-served with the script leftovers. This leaves Kerry Fox to prop the film up and she creates quite a remarkable character actually, a temporal bohemian spirit in an article, middle-class body.What Chereau's film does achieve is, amazingly, a sense of urban romance, even in the bleak existential wastes of these people's lives.

I had read a short summary of the content, but other than that, I did not know, what to expect. While watching this film, I was a little bit shocked, but mostly, because I was the guardian of a group of foreign exchange students, most of them under age and some of them really strong in their religious belief. So, the first time I saw an erect penis on screen in this film I thought, what are they going to think about us for taking them to such a movie. I was glad that after a while, they all seemed to get bored of the picture. As was I.What I did not like about the movie is not the sex scenes. To be frank, if I had been there alone, I would have enjoyed them. It is quite refreshing to see a couple making love in front of a camera that does not seem to have jumped out of a playboy magazine. Also, the fact that the camera did not want to hide anything made it a lot more convincing to me.What bothered me was the length. The idea of the movie is interesting and some scenes are great, especially the one in which the lover confronts the husband (the terrific Timothy Spall) with the possibility that his wife might be cheating on him. But that is about all. In the first half there is barely any dialogue. This makes sense during the sex scenes which are supposed to show two people who have no other interest in each other than to make love, but in other scenes it is really annoying. Then during the talky second half (which does not show any sex at all) the characters mostly talk about rubbish. In my opinion, the dialogue that is especially bad is when the woman (Kerry Fox) talks to her acting student (Marianne Faithful, I did not know she could act) about the deaths they had experienced before.All in all it is a typical French movie, except that it is in English. A movie that comes about wanting to talk about something really important, but in the end you feel cheated. I think the entire film could have been a lot better had it not tried to be so damn intellectual. I count myself an intellectual, but sometimes it is too much even for me.

Grimy and ugly images stand in need of justification &#150; of STRONG justification &#150; which they usually do not receive; beautiful images justify themselves. We should not look at a film this miserable and dingy and simply say, Oh well, that's the way they chose to make it. We should ask whether the returns (if any) on making everything look like mould justify the inherent cost. In this case it's so clear that they don't that it's no wonder the question isn't asked.This is nowhere more obvious than in the sex scenes, in which an actor and an actress who are probably attractive enough in real life are filmed so as to inspire as much lust as a couple of diseased fish. Are these scenes grimy simply because they're grimy, or are they grimy because Chéreau mistakenly thinks griminess is a touchstone of reality? Either way they're all wrong. This casual sex is meant to motivate, in one way or another, everything that happens in the course of the entire film; if the two participants can't be made to look as though they're enjoying it, they could at least be made to look as though enjoyment isn't utterly out of the question.It hadn't occurred to me until reading other people's comments that this was an existentialist parable, and the reason for this is probably that the classic existentialist parables all have a bit of a spring in their step. This trudges on and on and on in a spirit of grim weariness, concentrating intently on its characters' mean-spirited squabbles as though they were fascinating, which they're manifestly not.P.S. I'd like to take this opportunity to warn people off the only other film by Chéreau I've seen Queen Margot (1994). It's every bit as repellent and tedious as this one.

It's an independent film and the standards of film-making are simply just OK.Not all great low-budget films have likable characters but when you have one so ugly, it helps to make up for it by at least having characters we can relate to. (Good example The Panic in Needle Park. You feel like yelling at the characters, but you care for them because you can relate to their daily struggles -- lack of food, employment, money, etc. -- anyone who's been down on luck before can understand.) But Intimacy isn't the same. It's about a family guy who dumps his wife and kids and becomes a bartender at a London pub. He meets an anonymous woman for sex every week in a dirty apartment in a bad area.The movie doesn't work as an art-house experiment because it's neither artsy nor experimental. It pretends to be by showcasing those famous lingering shots that's become really tiring since every indie filmmaker decided it was a sign of talent and originality. It's not experimental because it follows the guidelines in terms of direction, cinematography and acting. It's not erotic because the sex scenes are dull and Kerry Fox is, to be totally honest, an ugly woman. (Which is the point - it makes the story more realistic - but all the same it also makes it un-erotic.) I think women would probably say the same about the male lead - and I hate to be the first person to point it out, but in regards to the infamous real sex scenes in the film... he's about as big as a blade of grass, and Kerry Fox is about as stimulating to watch as bumer-to-bumper traffic.It's not deep because it's so basic - we get to see the lack of morality in the leading characters. Well whoop-dee-do, so what? You're likely to find much better films out there than this. In terms of independent cinema it's a big let-down because it seems like any major Hollywood film hiding underneath the mold of something it isn't. The story isn't anything special and has been done before, the acting is just so-so, the erotic imagery isn't erotic, the level of entertainment is about zilch.All in all it comes across as a cheap imitator of Last Tango in Paris, which is about a hundred times better and a much more prominent example of having unlikable characters in a movie that we can still feel a connection for.

Stop start, two Advil, wait half an hour start again. I thought it was me, maybe because I'm in a weakened condition that I couldn't take this film, the sex, the nervous camera work, the blue gel acid bypass color palette, the emotions, both their absence and presence. Two more advil. Maybe I'm too old for this, but I love Last Tango , and I loved it at a recent screening. And I love porn. I love gasper Noe's work. But this was really much ado about nothing with ugly thrown into the bargain. Don't let this sway you from seeing Queen Margot which is pretty darn good.

Was this supposed to be a joke title? Is this Europe's cinema Veriee? Or perhaps neo cinema Veriee? Makes no difference what they call it, but it doesn't come off as particularly realistic. Perhaps it's neo Euro-trash porn. They tried to put porn into mainstream movies in the early 70s and it failed. And so it will fail this time, too, in spite of such talentless - and hence highly regarded - Eurotrash directors such as von Trier who propagate such junk. I hardly think that showing a man's erection adds to the realism of a movie. What about the dialogue? On quite a few occasions the characters talk and interact in an unrealistic way; real people simply don't behave the way these characters do half of the time. Yet, there is a belief that just because Kerry Fox is actually shown putting her co-star's erection in her mouth that this will somehow add new dimensions to the realism of a movie, realism never seen before. I think not.On the other hand, I always had the wish to see the seemingly impossible a (semi-)famous actress in a pornographic scene. I can't say I wasn't pleased when Kerry Fox in one scene grabs her co-stars penis, and then even orally pleasures it (briefly, unfortunately) in another scene. And it's rather nice that it was Kerry Fox who has had the dubious privilege of becoming one of extremely few known actresses to become a temporary porn star. Of course, I'd love to see Shirley MacLaine get it from behind, Elizabeth Taylor engage in masturbation, Susan Sarandon do it doggy-style, etc, but Fox is a pretty good choice, too. Though, I must say, Fox looks more than a little embarrassed in the porn scenes. Considering she got some award in some meaningless little European festival, this is surprising. I mean, didn't the jury who awarded her notice her obvious lack of relaxedness during the sex scenes? Lousy Eurotrash jury...The movie isn't too boring. The hand-held camera shtick is quite tiresome at times - another hint that this director belongs to the Lars von Trier trash director's club of European losers. (Losers 95.) The film would have been a shade weaker if it weren't for Fox's charisma. The male lead was ideally cast in Institute Benjamenta, but rather badly cast this time around. Being a continental European, his accent takes too long to get used to and it's rather silly the way he tries to do a British/London/whatever-accent-he's-supposed-to-be-doing and his swearing (which is regular) comes off as totally unconvincing. There is also a character who plays a gay man - which seems to be a must in today's movies and sit-coms every film and series has to have a homosexual, and it's almost always a happy-go-lucky smart-ass full of wise advice for the lead characters, who are of course straight. (And every courtroom scene nowadays has to have a black female judge, as if that will contribute to solving the problem of racism, but that's another story.) All in all, much better than anything von Trier has/will ever come up with, but ultimately pointless.How dumb does Kerry Fox have to be to be suckered into doing a porn film? Don't worry, dear, it's art. People will respect you even more as an artist. "},{"Title":"Plot ?
