Despite the icky (and variable in quality, though impressive in the last 10 minutes) special effects and the large amounts of blood and t&a, the film never becomes truly disturbing, because you're never meant to take it 100% seriously. Michael Madsen understood that, to be sure, and thanks to his trademarked coolness, he walks away with the picture. As for Natasha Henstridge, she has more or less a supporting part, but one that is rather imaginatively linked to the central story line. Overall, a movie with no artistic pretensions and, undoubtedly, many flaws (someone else already mentioned this; why didn't her head explode when she escaped from the lab?), but watch it in the right frame of mind and it's quite enjoyable.

By adapting a more straight-up storyline instead of dealing with all the science and facts, there's considerably more action in this one in terms of splattered victims which seems to be the main focus of the first half. With an increase of splatter, there's some great kills and creature make-up used during those scenes, and the tentacled beings covered in slime generate a lot of fun, especially bursting forth from people's stomachs or chasing around the ground which are good times. Several other scenes with the alien children shooting their cocoons together and the effects work there allows even more goopy, gory fun in conjunction with a continuation of fun kills, miraculous healing abilities from both creatures and copious nudity. There are some flaws here, though, namely the decision to allow the captured male into the quarantined zone with the girl when there's plenty of knowledge to indicate his goal is to mate with her, as well as the film's rather tacky CGI during the finale when the practical effects were working so well. It loses some steam in the middle where they keep coming up short in the quest to stop him rampaging and raping woman as they're always on the other end of it, but otherwise there's still a lot to like here.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity, several Sex Scenes and attempted rapes "},{"Title":"What the....?","Date":"2 July 2001","Score":"20 out of 34 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  This movie sucks!

Preston and Laura team up with a peaceful, genetically re-engineered Sil (Natasha Henstridge) to track the monster down.The first film became a cult favorite mostly because of the excessive nudity, near as I can tell. The plot was pretty straightforward and it does not stand out as one of those films that needed multiple sequels and its own franchise. And yet, here we are.Writer Chris Brancato was working with MGM and knew the studio was interested in making a follow-up to Species. He pitched an idea to executive Greg Foster where this time two hybrid alien women would strike. Foster liked it, but once Brancato went to Species producer Frank Mancuso Jr., he asked to approach this from a different angle, so that we don't have a tired retread of the original, as sequels often are. So Brancato took inspiration from The Manchurian Candidate, where somebody on a mission comes back, apparently a hero, but actually with some terrible demon inside. We get much of the original cast back, and some really fine additional casting, including James Cromwell and a memorable role by Peter Boyle. We also get director Peter Medak on board, one of the great Masters of Horror (given his background in Hammer and The Changeling)... and even aliens designed by no less an artistic authority than H. R. Giger. In many ways, this film exceeds the original.Having Medak on board brought a few key changes. When Medak was approached by producer Frank Mancuso, a condition of Medak's agreement was to hire on composer Edward Shearmur (Die Hard). Also, Peter Boyle is a friend of Medak's and they have worked together many times since the 1970s, so we have Medak to thank for this key bit of casting. Even production designer Miljen Kreka Kljakovic came through Medak. (Kljakovic is not a household name, but look him up -- from Delicatessen on, he has made a long list of great films.)And yet, the critics hated it and even the cast was disappointed. Michael Madsen expressed his opinion saying, Species II was a crock of (doody). There are a number I'm not very proud of. The movie studios can't mind that much, as they haven't contacted me to tell me off about it. I'm honest - if I've made a bad movie, I want my fans to know what they're letting themselves in for. (Regardless of what Madsen thinks of the film, Medak loved working with him.)I have to disagree with Madsen. The film is actually intelligent and clever in a way. The special effects were ahead of their time, even if they may appear dated today. The head regeneration scene is a bit cheesy, but even that allegedly cost $75,000. So it was not a cheap effect. I suspect when people look back now (2016), they will see this is a better film than given credit for.The Scream Factory disc has an old audio commentary ported over (and it is as good as ever). We also have a new interview with Natasha Henstridge, which gives us a bit of a rundown on her career and how she transitioned from modeling to Species. Oh, and don't forget new interviews with the effects crew. Whether you think this is a good movie or not, these interviews are valuable and really put 1990s horror and science fiction in context.

Meanwhile, Dr. Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger, from the previous film) and her scientists have cloned the DNA that made the previous creature (Sil), and she looks exactly the same, they've named her Eve (Natasha Henstridge, also from the first film), she has been made friendlier, and she is fine as long as their are no men around the facility she is locked it. You soon realise that Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard) is the one who is infected, the other two are fine, and that he is having numerous amounts of sex, and making many children that will eventually evolve/mature into monsters like what we've seen before. The female astronaut dies, but Dennis Gamble (Forrest Gump's Mykelti Williamson) is accompanies Laura, and Press Lennox (Michael Madsen, last from the previous film), the hunter. Also starring Basic Instinct's George Dzundza as Colonel Carter Burgess Jr., James Cromwell as Senator Judson Ross and Myriam Cyr as Anne Sampas.

I still regret seeing it to this day.The story is standard that makes no ****ing sense. Three astronauts go to Mars, with only one actually landing on the surface (Massive logic flaw there. Even NASA wouldn't put someone at that big of risk). Anyway, on his trip, Patrick Ross leaves an American flag and picks up three rock samples (16 months in space for three hunks of stone. That sounds more like NASA). But when he reboards the main ship and the crew get ready to head back to Earth, unbeknowst to them, one of the rock samples spews out a sentient puddle of dark green goo, that assimilates with the astronauts without them knowing. Upon their return to Earth, Patrick celebrates the best way he knows after being told they were in sexual quarantine and making an appearance at some big ball for the crew, he gets a couple socialites in a hotel room and nails them both. Both women get to see his back sprout tentacles before they both go through nine months of pregnancy and the little half alien brood bursts out of their bodies. Patrick quickly stashes the kids in a childhood barn. While all this has been happening, we find out that Laura (from the previous movie) now runs a program designed to find weaknesses in the aliens, using a clone of the first alien, named Eve, as her test subject. Eve is supposed to be more docile and has her more alien traits dormat, but that doesn't stop her from getting incredibly excited when Patrick's brood are born (due to a psychic ability the aliens have). The government realizes they have another alien sex machine and calls in bad ass alien exterminator Press Lennox. They check the other two astronauts as the sexual quarantine lifts and Patrick, having spawned other alien seeds, retreats for a romantic weekend with his fiancé. Press and Laura find astronaut one, the woman in the crew, already impregnated but they are able to contain the situation (Although the woman astronaut dies without any explanation). They track the other astronaut (who is the definition of bad stereotypes about black people) down but discover he was immune to the alien goo because he is a carrier of sickle cell anemia. Patrick awakes next to his gutted fiancé and another alien child and decides he must stop it. He puts on his air force uniform and takes his hunting rifle out on the deck. Just as the black astronaut arrives, Patrick blows his entire head off. And it grows back. He now sets out to spread his seed even more. The team decides to use Eve's psychic ability to track him. They find him just after he realizes Eve and take him in to custody. He finally reveals his true colors when they arrive at the facility Eve is at. After escaping, he goes to his spawn and puts them in cocoons. As the team, now joined by the black astronaut, gets ready to track Patrick, Eve breaks out and goes to him. They follow and use some kind of spray to kill the alien brood. Eve and Patrick start going at it as aliens (yes, it is disturbing) but the team manages to turn Eve back against Patrick. He proceeds to kill her by forcing a phallic looking tentacle down her throat. They finally kill Patty boy with a pitch fork covered in black astronaut's sickle cell filled blood. Eve's dead body is carted out as they clean up the barn, only to be shown something may have survived....There isn't much redeeming about this movie. There is a LARGE amount of nudity and sex but it is always followed by an exploding uterus, something that only needed to be shown once but is showcased again and again. There are plot and logic holes you could drive a truck through scattered throughout, which combined with terrible writing and an uninterested cast, makes the whole thing tedious. The only thing I even remotely like about the movie was the design of the aliens, as Giger's work truly shines no matter how crappy the movie is. I actually feel bad giving this movie a 1 out of 10.

The result was a half-human, half-alien monster that once released into the world had the capability to destroy all human life as we know it. Fortunately, an emergency team was assembled which destroyed the alien before it could propagate. However, apparently not content to let matters rest, the U.S. government decides to recreate that same alien life-form under what they consider to be even better security. Ironically, the top-secret project is headed by a scientist named Dr. Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger) who just happens to have been one of the people who helped destroy the first alien a few years previously. At the same time, a manned space mission to Mars blasts off even though one of the scientists involved in the process warns of the possible existence of alien DNA there that might have been responsible for wiping out all basic life on the planet. Naturally, rather than heed his warnings, the U.S. government arrogantly confines him into a mental institution and proceeds full speed ahead. Sure enough, after landing on Mars two of the three astronauts become infected with the alien DNA and they are heading back to earth&#x97;where the alien life-form named Eve (Natasha Henstridge) waits in her secure lab facility. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that typically sequels are seldom as good as their predecessor and this particular film is no exception as there were some scenes which were simply too preposterous. Additionally, I didn't care for some of the special effects which included all of the scenes involving the alien offspring. However, the story itself was fairly interesting and the fact that both Natasha Henstridge and Marg Helgenberger were cast in this movie certainly helped this film as well.

On their trip back to earth, soil samples that were taken manage to unthaw & alien DNA immediately take over the crew wherein Ross & his team pass out, only to re-awaken mere moments later with no clue or memory as to what happened. Meanwhile Dr Laura Baker (the returning MARG HELGENBERGER) has successfully cloned EVE (which stands for Exterterrestrial Vulnerabilty Experiment) a genetically modified version of the previous films antagonist Sil (again played by the gorgeous NATASHA HENSTRIDGE) who is a lot more docile & more importantly, more controllable than her counterpart ever was. Pretty soon, Dr. Baker learns that one or more members of the Mars expedition team, may be infected with alien DNA, after a fellow scientist is found murdered & blood left on the scene shows alien DNA mixed in the blood. Teaming up with her former beau, hired assassin PRESS LENNOX (The returning MICHAEL MADSEN) to try & find which member or members, of the team is infected. After a member of the team tests clean, another has been infected by alien embryo, that has caused her to give north to a creature that both kills her & her husband. Soon both Lennox & Baker discovers that Patrick Ross (JUSTIN LAZARD) is infected as well. When Ross discovers what has happened to him, following the murder of a couple of women & his own wife, which he has no memories of, he tries to kill himself by blowing his head clean off. He finds death is not an option, as his head quick reforms & the alien DNA takes completely over, turning him into a deceiving, cold, emotionless monster! who goes out impregnating any woman willing to come with him, with each victim, the female host produces a child, which in a matter of a few days, will grow to virtual adult hood & impregnate more females, ending the human species on earth in a manner of a few short months!SPECIES II is a fairly enjoyable B movie, that while not as good as the first, manages to be a fairly amusing & fun monster B movie regardless of a few short comings. Again as I stated in my review of the original film, this franchise is no different from any other B movie killer alien flick cluttering video shelves, since it contains copious amounts of male & female nudity, tons of gore & gooey monster make-ups. The only difference being that much like the first, SPECIES II is gifted with a bigger budget, A list talent & treated to a wide theatrical release. The special effects this time out has been handed over to special effects guru STEVE JOHNSON, who does fairly well in creating several gory, gooey death scene & alien tentacles & invents a few over the top kills, such as an alien creature ripping out a woman's womb, a vicious child birthing scene, a gory autopsy on a former victim, a scientist is gutted by an alien tentacle, another alien tentacle bursts through a man's stomach & out his throat etc. The monster suits are just as impressive as ever & yet I will say that despite the fact this film clearly had a bigger budget, it somehow feels smaller, mainly due to the fact that there are no heavy stunts involved & the death sequences & make-ups for whatever reason feels cheaper. The direction by PETER MEDAK is pretty good & the acting remains above par for this type of film & while not as good or as suspenseful as the original film, SPECIES II still proves to be a good time for fans wanting a really fun, cheesy, gooey, gory B movie.I will say that the film, while entertaining, it unfortunately suffers from a few flaws that I felt could have been worked out in the script before going behind the camera. The plot seems less interesting & at times tries to take itself seriously & while it was great to see NATASHA HENSTRIDGE (who receives top billing here) come back in her kick butt alien role, she spends the entire movie trapped in a glass environment, in a science lab called BIOHAZARD LEVEL 4 (not much fun there) until she breaks out in the last ten minutes to mate & fight with Ross, in a fairly fun climax. DENNIS FELDMAN who penned the really fun original returns as an Executive Producer here.All in all, while it lacks the freshness & fun of the original film, SPECIES II does't miss out by much. It doesn't try to be anything it's not & for that I fully appreciate it for what it is, a sex & blood drenched, gooey B movie monster flick. Despite it's flaws which are many, it's nothing more than B movie junk food & for that I say give this movie a rental & don't take it to seriously & you should have fun.

It doesn't make sense, but it moves along and is reasonably well-produced (saving some fairly impressive effects for the end). What makes this film feel like it's something more than the silliness it is is the presence of a lot of good actors. But don't let that fool you. No-one took anything seriously in making this film, so don't think for a minute that you should either. The original SPECIES, while no classic, was a serious thriller. This one is decidedly not.In a film full of plot holes and anomalies (other people here have already identified many of them, though nothing really adds up if you think too much about any of it), my favorite one is this the Patrick Ross character is rolling around in bloodbaths for a large portion of the center section of the movie -- and yet he always seems to have a fresh set of clean and pressed clothes. He must have had to take numerous showers and changed his clothes---and yet...when would that have happened? Or does his ability to regenerate his DNA extend to his clothing as well? ;)I know, this is the least of the movie's problems, but it represents how silly the whole film is.Yet all it's goofyness is absolved (somewhat) by our knowing deep down that it has its tongue subtly but firmly in cheek. Don't take it seriously, and it easily becomes a good time on an evening with a bowl of popcorn and nothing better to do. There's a lot of decent actors in it, and most of them seem to be in on the joke. And, as ever, it doesn't take much armtwisting to look at Ms. Henstridge.

Probably the most offensive thing out of many offensive things in Species II, Mykelti Williamson plays a man who can't utter a single sentence without it being a reference to himself as a brother, or how much he wants some bootie. There's even a reference to him having large genitals, and of course when he gets the girl, she has to be black. God forbid he should actually date a white girl, right? I'm actually amazed they didn't just stick a mop and bucket and a bowl of KFC in his hand and have done with it. An absolutely risible representation of black man in a trash movie.Naturally, this being Hollywood then the strong (ie. white male) survive to dominate the picture. Sure, the women can talk about science, but they're there to be told to shut up and sit back so we can concentrate on Natasha Henstridge's breasts. Of course, in these sort of films the makers forget that someone gets to be an alpha male by brains as well as testosterone, so we get the thick as bricks Patrick (played by Justin Lazard) walking around doing whatever he pleases. Hey, he's a red blooded, wholesome American - he gets to do what he wants, right? That includes having the exploitative titillation of the entire premise (alien propagates via sex) subverted with an attempted rape. There's even a delightful cut scene instated on the DVD where he kills a transvestite. Lovely stuff.In the opposite corner as the tolerable face of ego-led masculinity is Michael Madsen in a what the Hell is he doing in this? excursion.

On the one hand, sometimes I feel like I am extremely harsh to movies that I can't stand (read my reviews of Scary Movie 1, 2, or 3, for example), but on the other hand, maybe I didn't hate Species II as much as many people because I've seen more bad movies than they have. I have a bad habit of watching movies even if I already know I'm going to hate them (this is why I've seen Scary Movie, 2 and 3, for example), so this may be why I've been a little bit numbed to idiocy in the movies.I can certainly recognize stupidity at any level when I see it in the movies, and there is plenty of it in Species II, but it takes a lot more than this movie has for me to describe it as the worst movie I've ever seen or a total waste of celluloid or some other such nonsense. It is certainly not, for example, a grade Z exploitation flick, ripe for the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 treatment. In a massive lapse of cognitive function, scientists, including Dr. Baker from the 1st movie, have decided to make a clone of Sil, this time named Eve, to study her more extensively than they had the chance last time. They somehow made her more docile and controllable (although still female), and she cooperates with them, suffering through the tests and tortures that she has to endure for them to demonstrate things like her remarkable ability to heal. After one such session, Dr. Baker walks Eve back to her glass holding cell, and Eve tiredly asks Dr. Baker something like, Why do you do this to me? Eve spends her time reading and learning to drive by watching Dukes of Hazzard, her favorite show, when she's not being poked and prodded by people in white coats. The only thing that the scientists seem to remember about Sil from the last movie is her unstoppable sex drive, so men are not allowed anywhere inside the area where she is kept, at least until the end when Dennis Gamble (Mykelti Williamson), one of the men on the mission to Mars casually walks in, walks right up to the glass and tries to flirt with her. Good thing she was unimpressed by his genetic code, otherwise they may have had a serious security breach on their hands.While scientists were busy studying Eve for some kind of weakness that they could use should another, ah, outbreak occur, other scientists are busy successfully completing the first manned mission to Mars. On the way back, there is a lapse of communication for seven minutes, I think, and the next thing you know one of the scientists has been infected with alien DNA, much like the stuff running through Eve's veins. Evidently the smart aliens (in this series, the ones in space, off-screen, sending intelligent radio signals to earth) have intercepted the Mars mission and sent a scout back to earth for another shot at those pesky humans. But fear not, it's not long before the slimy monster aliens take over the colonization efforts.Given the feeble plot, it's not hard to see why Species II focuses entirely on the sexual aspect of the alien species. Natasha Henstridge is not most, but ALL of the draw that this movie has, so they have to pander to who they know is in the theaters. And judging from what happens during the movie, most of the people in theaters are adolescent boys who really shouldn't be watching this movie. Okay that was a guess, but while Natasha gets topless for about three seconds, there is still extensive nudity and group sex in the movie, most of which results in bloody birth scenes stolen from the Alien movies, as he steadily compiles a growing herd of offspring.Dennis Gamble, the token black guy and comic relief, has no purpose but to constantly complain that he can never get any booty, until scientists inform him that because he's a carrier of sickle cell anemia, his blood can be used as a weapon against the alien. In the movie's defense, there is a great scene where Patrick Ross, who was infected in space, finally reaches Eve, with whom his hormones have been communicating since he got back to earth, and they have an intense love scene from opposite sides of thick glass. Interesting in that it is a shining moment of skillful acting in an otherwise dreary slog of drivel.Also, I have to admit that I was impressed with the head regeneration scene, but only in the way that I was impressed with many of the special effects in Hollow Man. It was a fascinating thing to watch, despite all the while being very obviously a special effect. If you absolutely loved the first film (and I mean LOVED it), then you may enjoy this one slightly as well. But in the Species series even more than normal, if you didn't like the original you'll hate the sequel. And in some cases, hating this sequel doesn't even require a lukewarm opinion of the original.

It is indeed comprehensible but in no way believable, having more holes in it than a very very large colander with hundreds of tiny tiny holes. The script has obviously been hacked about and changed so often that sub-plots started in one place never resurface or get resolved in another place. When faced with any choice the characters in the movie always choose the one most likely to get them killed. The gore factor is high and almost never justified. Female nudity is frequent and almost never justified.Also in its favour it can be said that the creature effects are not bad though rather dark to hide the wires. H.R. Geiger has not yet asked to have his name removed from the titles.In short, unless you are Barry Norman, a critic with a broadsheet newspaper, a stickler for plots, logicality, quality and sanity then you are bound to enjoy this film.

The hero tries the best he can to act, but you can tell he really has no idea what he's doing. Besides all the things wrong with this, it does have some pretty decent effects especially from 1997. The part where said hero shoots a certain part of his self, when it comes back that is pretty cool, even by today's standards. I would recommend this as maybe a drinking game.

But, in one of the planetary samples, a specific fungus carrying the alien race from the first SPECIES film thaws out on board the American space shuttle and invade the body of Patrick and astronaut Anne Sampas(Myriam Cyr). For some strange reason, Dennis Gamble(Mykelti Williamson)wasn't invaded by the alien. Later testing might prove that being a sickle cell anemia carrier might've saved him. This also might be a key to killing them because it's proved through experimental testing by Dr. Laura Baker(Marg Helgenberger)on clone half-human/half-alien Eve(the VERY, VERY sexy Natasha Henstridge)that the breed are able to regenerate cells.When women are being found mutilated soon the government will be on the lookout for Patrick, who has been having sex with various females(hookers, lovers, admirers, etc)and impregnating them with half-human/half-alien children who burst from the stomach not too long after mating occurs. When these children reach a certain stage in numerous days, they will turn into a cocoon and once released will be fully grown to terrorize and conquer the human race. Colonel Carter Burgess, Jr(George Dzundza)is the military muscle behind pushing the experimental project for finding a way to kill the alien species and when he discovers that another is on earth(..after the murder of a scientist who discovers alien genes in Patrick's blood), he calls in Press Lennox(Michael Madsen), the kind of special ops man/bounty hunter with a skill for finding prey he target. He's the man the government call in to do their dirty work. He'll team with Dennis who sees for himself, when Patrick blows his head off with a shotgun(..with it subsequently regenerating before his very eyes), what the alien is. Laura, who has bonded with Eve during their period of time together(..while it's Laura's job to find a way to kill Eve, it's really her agenda to protect her from harm), will also have to team with press to stop what could be a global disaster from taking place. Patrick must be stopped and the storage place of the cocooning aliens must be found before it's too late. The most prominent threat..if Patrick and Eve mate an even more advanced alien being might emerge perhaps too unstoppable for anyone to handle.The cast doesn't have a lot to do except quote their lines and the film is rather derivative of other similar sci-fi films using threatening aliens, but I found it decently entertaining in a race-against-time sort of way. I wanted more Henstridge, here used more as a sympathetic being, and the pace is so fast plot can not catch up..but, I'm one in the minority who doesn't believe this is the worst sequel ever. It was just not as well developed, screenplay-wise. It does feel rushed, but has some gruesome alien-attack sequences such as the aliens protruding from the bellies of their human mother hosts. It's forgettable, but could be looked at as a flick to watch when you got time to kill.

Meanwhile, Eve, the monster from the first movie, has been geneto-scienterifically reincarnated as a good guy (sort of the like the Terminator, but I digress). She is now hanging out in a sealed bubble, attended to by female scientists. You see, if Eve espies a man, she is likely to freak out and go into the kind of terrifying mating frenzy that made the first movie such a riot. I have an ex-girlfriend like that. Anyway, these martian-DNA-tainted astronauts are out there, and only Eve can stop them. So it is a battle to the death between hot-looking naked Natasha Hensridge and some equally naked muscly astronaut dude who has become the alien.Sound silly? Well, my God, it is. Don't bring your fascination with astrophysics or biotechnology with you when you pop this DVD in the player. Nope.

Their lines, f*** words were so stupid that you simply couldn't not to laugh. Some lines reminded me of Alien Resurrection's Ron Perlman (few lines were just awful, though acting and the movie were just superb unlike the one we talk about now). After all, Michael Madsen couldn't resist playing leading role in big studio movie. Overall acting was as if I were watching some video game FMV intros. Well, don't blame the actors - blame the screenwriters. When dialog is horrible, I guess you can't make some scene out of it. Maybe it was the question of money for most actors who reprised original characters from the first movie. The concept of killing Species by spraying some human diseases cells is rather stupid I'd say. Also supposed bursting of women's stomachs who gave birth to little species strangely resembled accurate opening of the Aliens' eggs. I don't get it, why does astronaut woman have sex with his boyfriend dressed like 18th century maid after 10 months in space? And there are loads of funny stupidities in the movie that won't make you yawn. I think the movie even with such poor plot could be much better if the whole tone was darker and scarier, without unnecessary lame humor. There is certainly more facts about Species' life cycle which supposedly would set Species universe and make franchise popular (as Aliens, Predator). That will help comics for now. They should think of some decent screenplay if they will ever consider to do a sequel (it is welcome). FX at the end were OK. And yes, Natasha Henstridge... She is beautiful, who cares about acting?

You can read a lot about current attitudes towards sexuality and gender nowadays by comparing commentary between the first and second films of this series. They are essentially the same film, with the first film having the advantage of overall better acting and, of course, being the first film. The second film actually has better effects, some of the same actors, but suffers from sequel-itis. Of course, its biggest drawback (in the minds of many) is that, unlike the first film, the alien/human predator is male. This means that he spends most of the film raping females, which reverses the situation in the first film. No one made much of a fuss about the sexual violence in the first film, because it was the Henstridge character committing it. But its there (check out Henstridge's attempted forcing sex upon the male in the pool and at the end for examples.)

Presently I saw this first sequel, Species II and perhaps expected it to start near where the first one left off, but it doesn't. In what seemed to me a bit of scientific foolishness, an astronaut lands on Mars just for a few minutes, while the rest of the crew orbits, then after taking three core samples re-joins the mother ship, and puts the samples into cryo-cooled chambers for the trip back to Earth.Meanwhile a new female creature named Eve was made from the dead Sil's DNA, and she has been carefully molded and studied with the hopes of unlocking the secret to fighting off the alien DNA and its species. Natashia Henstridge is still beautiful in that sister role.SPOILERS FOLLOW. As the astronauts prepare to head back home, we see one of the cryo chambers defrost, pop open, and a copious amount of snot oozes out and onto the floor, and during a brief blackout attacks the one that was on Mars, infecting him without anyone being aware. Back home, his main desire is to have sex with young naked women and impregnate them with this alien DNA. One mad scientist, who was in the looney bin, theorized that Mars was once very similar to Earth, but it was rendered barren eons ago after this strange species inhabited it and, if we are unable to fight it off, a barren Earth will be next.Sensing an urgency, Eve escapes and eventually battles the new alien that had taken over the astronaut's body, and both apparently die.

The gore is plentiful but laughable, the dialogue and script ridiculous, acting and production values are close to rock bottom. The best thing you can say about it is that it's short.However, there must be some redeeming value to it, because I did watch the whole thing. I shut off Anchorman after 30 deadening minutes. I also bailed on Resident Evil after about 45 minutes. Perhaps if Species II had gone on ten minutes longer I might have hit the Stop button.I've read that Species III went direct to video.

Michael Madsen walks through his role. Marg Helgenberger was surprisingly good (considering she has the worst dialogue). James Cromwell is excellent as a slimy senator. As the main SIL here Lazard tries--but he's given nothing to work with. He is a very handsome man with a very nice body but can't do anything with his character.And it has a silly ending which sets up Species III. There is one very disturbing aspect of this picture--there are MANY views of nude women torn open and dead as their babies come out.

The good news is that (most of) the principal cast returned (quite a rarity in sequels these days) and it sort of follows the Terminator/T2 rule where the original bad guy is now the good guy, helping to defeat something even worse.Despite the original alien, played by Natasha Henstridge with her trademark lack of clothes, being killed off in the original, she's been cloned back now to help the human race hunt down a second alien (this time male). Now&#x85; that doesn't sound like a bad plot for a B-movie, however, my main problem was that Natasha Henstridge is hardly in it! She only really comes into the film in the final act and, by then, it's a little too late to make any real difference.The story focuses on all the wrong characters. Even though you also have Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger reprise their respective characters, the film spends too much time on those related to sub-plots and a new sidekick who is little more than a wise-cracking helper who's constant slang and (alleged) witticisms about his lack of sex soon become annoying.But, when the story gets it right, it still retains enough of the fun and bloodthirsty chaos of the original to make it just about watchable.

I got this movie on a bad quality copy, so i thought i'd never sit this one through.However!  At times Species 2 reminded me at the older sci-fi flicks from the fifties and sixties which i love so much.  Mostly this was due to the flat characters and the so-so special effects and gives it its own touch. Species 2 is simply better then its original, for a mainstream movie there's so much gore that it's got to be one of the few around, the effects and action scenes are fairly good and original and there's of course...Natasha Henstridge!the story is simple.  as in a lot of classic SF-movies, the aliens are brought to earth via Mars.  The alien nested itself in the body of a young astronaut whom, when back on earth, immediately starts to reproduce by having sex with as many women as he can.  As stated in the movie by hero-on-duty Michael Madsen They can f*** the human race to pieces.. Not only is there a male alien on the loose, there's also a cloned female from the first alien (see Species 1).  When she has escaped you can expect the grande finale with the gory-sexual pieces as an extra.This is one of the better SF's i've seen.

The most glaring example is how Patrick and the other (female) infected astronaut failed to mate despite being stuck together in close proximity in a spacecraft for the year or two it takes to get from Mars to Earth. Then there was that ludicrous scene where Eve escaped. Yeah, Sill got out because the cage they kept her in wasn't strong enough... so of course they're not going to make Eve's cage out of anything stronger! And they've been experimenting on her for years but never bothered to test whether or not their rifles would be effective on her, or whether they should use heavier weapons! Then there's how they send a small number of lightly armed mostly untrained people after her and Patrick, as opposed to a heavily armed SEAL team. And remember how Patrick's blood mutated into some tentacle monster that killed a guy when they tried to test it... guess what was never mentioned again!Don't even get me started on the realism aspect. I mean, a two minute pregnancy in a normal human woman... I'm sorry, even by sci fi standards that's an insult to all medical science. Whoever thought it up clearly has no clue about how pregnancy & the female body works. I don't care if they're fatal a fetus that grows like that would never survive long enough to reach viability outside the womb, all you'd get is an instantaneous miscarriage. Mind you, it wouldn't be an issue if this was a decent movie in other respects, but it isn't.The acting and dialog were truly terrible. I'm sorry, I just can't get emotionally involved in what's happening to these people at all. They have all the believability and pathos of a glass of water. The ONLY character I ever got any emotional investment in was that nameless woman Patrick grabbed out of a supermarket and tried to rape, and that's just because it's a situation that naturally pushes any decent person's buttons and actually felt fairly believable (it happens in real life after all, minus the spawn evil alien baby part).The thing that made the original Species surprisingly good was that Sill was a person who was interesting and who you could sympathize with to a degree. Patrick is neither. I think they should have just let Sill's son survive (hey, if those things can survive a headshot they should be able to survive third degree burns), I think he'd have made a much better alien. Then again, the people who made this film would have screwed that up just as badly.The general tone of the film was let's throw lots of blood and tits at the screen so nobody can see the plot holes! I have no problem with blood and death in a movie so long as it's in good taste, I LIKE horror movies, but this isn't. This is blood and death used as a substitute for decent story, characters, and acting. It's very obvious the scriptwriter and director put no effort into this thing whatsoever. From the glaringly obvious plot holes to the gratuitous rip-offs of better movies like Alien and the Thing (notice that Patrick's alien form looks remarkably like the queen from Aliens!).On that subject, I find the depiction of sex in this film probably its most distasteful aspect. The film has a lot of sex in it but that sex is anything but sexy. It has an adolescent surface titillation aspect to it, but under that it's all about gore and death, something icky to be scared of. It's juvenalia.Now I realize a movie about some freaky alien creature that wants to have sex so it can spawn some sort of freaky alien baby is inevitably going to involve a rather creepy form of eroticism, but the original Species wasn't anywhere near this juvenile. This is sex the way an emotionally troubled 14 year old virgin thinks of it. I'd be inclined to agree with other viewers that it's misogynistic and exploitive except the way it presents male sexuality is even worse.

At least the original 1995 film featured some impressive visual effects and playful nudity, whereas this sequel only has mean-spirited gore and gratuitous sex scenes. Remotely interesting is that the screenplay isn't just an identical re-telling of the original, but a fairly new Sci-Fi story....albeit a very BAD one. Once again, the scripting team behind Species associates alien life forms with insatiable sexual hunger, only this time the outer space monster is a male and thus even more determined to copulate all humanity to death. The first successful Mars expedition returns to earth but something awry happened to the three astronauts during the seven minute radio-intermission. The same extraterrestrial monster that provided yummy Sil with her alien DNA entered the bodies of the astronauts. One of them is immune, the second is destroyed fast but the final alien-carrier; the handsome and very popular Senator son Patrick Ross, quickly becomes an unstoppable killing machine. Beautiful Natasha Henstridge plays the clone of her own original character, who's telepathically linked to the new alien/human hybrid. Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger both return, but their characters' personalities seem to have changed drastically. The respond to certain situations different than before and the script doesn't even bother to enlighten us why they failed as a couple. These are still acceptable shortcomings... Much worse is the total lack of tension, the provocative dialogues and the exploitative portrayal of women. This movie will probably be enjoyed the most by younger and inexperienced horror & Sci-Fi fans that disregard a good, plausible plot on their search for graphic gore. We're really served a lot of that exploding heads, spontaneous alien-births, exaggeratedly long tentacles and torn open torsos. Yuck.

Three stars from the first film return to their roles; series pin-up Natasha Henstridge, Marg Helgenberger and, of course, the all-action hero Michael Madsen. A sequel to the original film really could have written itself as the door was left wide-open at the end, but instead of following on directly from the first film; we've got a thread about a mission to mars thrown in to further things. Three astronauts go to mars, and one of them comes back infected by alien DNA. The supposed national hero lusts for the recreated 'Sil' (a clone, a bit like Ripley was in Alien 4), who finds herself confined to a high security prison under the command of Dr. Laura Baker. However, when the astronaut begins killing women; the government realise that some serious clean-up work is in order, and proceed to track down Press Lenox; apparently the only man capable of helping to stop the alien.The film doesn't have a lot of depth as aside from letting us into the idea of the alien originating from mars; it's pretty much just a spin-off from the original. Characters from the first film return in identical roles, while new blood such as Mykelti Williamson don't do much to make the film any more interesting on the character front. It's obvious that this film wasn't given big studio backing as it all feels very cheap, and this is mostly down to the rubbish CGI, which was also featured in the original film. In fairness, here it isn't used as often and the effects that don't use computers do look rather nice. There's not a lot of gore on display, but there's some inventive kill scenes and the alien, being based on a H.R. Giger creation, is suitably imaginative. It's a shame that original star Natasha Henstridge is so underused, as her role feels a lot like it's only in the film as a tie to the original; and I'm sure that I'm not the only one who wouldn't have minded seeing more of her. Still, while this film really isn't very good; you can't expect brilliance from a sequel to a minor mid-nineties hit, and I did enjoy watching it.

Her character is a totally better one this time and quite frankly I think the movie and particularly its story would had been better off without it. It would had also made this movie more fresh and original to watch. 2 other actors from the fist movie also re-appear in this one; Michael Madsen and Marg Helgenberger. Michael Madsen is basically always awesome to watch in any movie and any type of role he plays. He is a pleasant addition to this movie, even though of course its far from his best movie role, which is also due to its silly script and poor dialog. The chemistry he had with Helgenberger in the first movie is also completely gone in this movie.Seriously the writing of this movie is so lazy. Her we have an alien that is being hunted down, who is inside the body of the first man who walked on Mars. That makes him about the number one most famous face of the world, yet he can walk around freely and the military and all secret agencies have a hard time tracking them down. Really not the most believable and likely plot premise. The movie is filled with some other holes and big improbabilities.There also are some new characters appearing in this movie, not played by the least actors. Mykelti Williamson, George Dzundza and James Cromwell are some well known names. There also is a quite nice little cameo by Richard Belzer as the U. S. president, which is quite fun if you know Richard Belzer. Unfortunately none of the great actors can really spice up the movie its script.The movie obviously had a lesser budget to spend this time. At times the movie even looks like a made-for-TV movie, which also might be due to the fact that director Peter Medak has a lot of experience with TV movie and not as much with big theatrical movies, even though he is capable of something better. Just watch the 1980 horror movie The Changeling. Despite that all, the movie its effects are all quite nice looking and the movie also has some good looking gore to shock with. What the movie is lacking though is its good eerie atmosphere of the first movie.

It screams B Film of the variety you thought had died 40 years ago.  There are buckets of blood and tons of fleshy explosions, gory, squirming tentacles everywhere, and much of it is filmed with the victim perfectly centered in the frame, usually with his or her face in clear view to exaggerate the cartoonish horror of it all.  YES, it's that kind of movie... Extended shots of corpses lying with their innards strewn about, and blood everywhere, vivid, gloppy red, and glistening under gratuitously bright lighting.There is even an over-the-top lesbian scene which could have been snipped directly from the Spice Channel.  And let's face it.  I am a chick, so I can see boobs whenever I want.  So long, drawn out boob-shots aren't that interesting to me.  In the first Species there can at least be found some male counterpoint to the female exposure,  (I am *more* than willing to sit through boob shots if it means getting some glimpse of Mike Madsen in the deal.) but that is not the case here.  This movie seems to be all about Boy Stuff, being littered with babes and guys trying to score all the time. It does not satisfy female tastes even in the roundabout way that the original film did.Even worse, this film does almost nothing with character.  While the original had a solid cast that spent significant time fleshing itself out, this movie skims over everything except the activities of the main alien, who is not interesting.   In the first Species, we got to watch Natasha Henstridge begin as an ignorant and speechless child, and gradually integrate with humans by learning their language and behaviors through trial and error.  Here, the alien is a split personality jock (who looks like a 1980s Tom Cruise), and dislikable from the very start, not at all rewarding to watch or learn about.  The other characters just seem to be going through the motions, and there is none of the seriousness or realism that we saw before.  To complete the unbelievable cliche, they have even added a wise-cracking black guy to the cast... You know that one?  The one who's always saying booty because that's the word-of-the-year?Species had one very noticeable weak area, and that was the ending, and the poor decision to stage it in the sewers.  This movie does have a fairly nice wrapup, as it takes place in a barn and there's some good old fashioned walloping, stabbing and wrestling-- perhaps the only high point of this dumb movie, and the only capacity in which it is superior to the first.Still, it's a drag and a shame. And like I said... literally shocking in its amateur execution.   Watch this one first, and it will make the original Species look like the 'Citizen Kane' of SciFi Horror.Species 2 is really ideal for Mystery Science Theater.Score D-Avoids an F only because of Madsen's presence, and the very end.

The military re-team Baker and Press Lenox with crew member Gamble to hunt down and destroy the alien before it breeds.This is a vapid piece of trash that doesn't even bother to take itself seriously.  The plot is daft in the extreme and was clearly thought up while the scriptwriters were driving to the pitch meeting.  The action is split into two camps.  First we have the horror sections which consist of rubbery monsters etc.  Secondly we have the human side with Michael Madsen et al - this is almost a comedy - certainly the actors are taking it seriously.  The horror bits are just for the sake of it - a man blows his head off in full colour for no discernable reason.  The story have no excitement, drama or tension, the effects are mainly poor - the `alien' being the worst and the final showdown being laughably terrible.The cast are terrible and deliver their lines with all the professionalism of monkeys.  Madsen and Helgenberger are good at this type of rubbish but even here their lines are poor and their performances are rough.  As with the first Species film - the cast seems to be full of good actors who didn't read the script.  James Cromwell is OK but he has been in much much better fare than this.  Williamson is not a great actor but has been in better films.  Here he is only allowed to be a `black sidekick' and comes across like a sub-par Will Smith, among the dialogue he's given is the clanger `I'm going back to Africa on somebody's ass!'.  Maybe the only thing that attracted him to the film is that he shares his last scene with a gorgeous nurse (Evelyn Ebo) who is by far the sexist woman in the whole film!  Dzunda is a famous face and really should know better.  Lazard is interesting but ultimately he's just a model-type.  Richard Belzer turns up for 30 seconds as the President - best known as Munch (Homicide LOTS) he clearly is trying to not be Munch, but he is too good for a cameo in this trash.The use of nudity and violence is aimed at the teenage boy market.

You'll be squirming in your seat and it wont be because of how scary or suspenseful this movie is, rather it'll be because of the mind bending torture you'll be subjected to.

With a few notable exceptions sequels are inferior products and FAECES 2 continues the traditionDoes anyone remember NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2 ? If you do then you`ll remember it ignores a very important plot device involving Freddy Krugar and his victims , and it`s the same with this film which totally ignores any internal continuity with the first movie . But you don`t really notice this when you see the makers have ignored important concepts like logic...First of all a manned mission is sent to Mars . Why ? , there`s no real reason ( Except to set up the plot of course ) for this happening . Yes I do know the Americans sent a dozen or so Americans to the moon but that was during the cold war when they were engaged in a space race with the USSR , both sides knew that if one side get there first the other side would have suffered a massive national humiliation hence both the USA and USSR spent massive amounts of money and expertise on trying to get to the moon first . Why do you think NASA stopped sending men to the moon ? Because they`d won the space race at the cost of billions of dollars while the Soviets weren`t prepared to spend vast amounts of resources on a meaningless race where they`d be only second . Space travel isn`t cost effective , that`s why NASA have a real life problem in sending manned missions to Mars because there`s no money to fund such a project . If someone found unlimited resources on Mars like oil NASA would be able to get funding but this isn`t mentioned in SPECIES 2 . NASA send a mission to Mars because it`s there and get some laughable sponsorship deal from soft drink and sportswear firmsNo hold on tell a lie , it transpires halfway through the movie that the US military want to put military bases on Mars . Military bases on Mars ? Against whom ? If it`s military bases with their missiles pointed against countries on Earth then where`s the logic in that ? Wouldn`t you keep the bases nearer their targets ? It`s a bit like General Tommy Franks keeping all his front line bases in Iceland when intervening in Afghanistan and Iraq. And neither does this contrived plot point explain how NASA got their incredible budget to go to Mars .Talking of the military , isn`t there some required basic fitness level for the military ? I`ve never seen a serviceman weigh four hundred pounds . This sums up all types of carelessness on the part of the makers , things like Lenox holding his pistol sideways . Why would he do that if the sights are located at the top of the gun ? Oh and the first man to step foot on Mars is the world`s most famous guy but can walk down a street without being recognised , until the script requires it . And is DNA a living sentinent being ?

They don't realize this right away. Or maybe they do, and simply cannot openly say that what we before were naive enough to combine with our own DNA(yeah, nice thinking) is now apparently a glob of smart goo. That moves. Jumps. And it can take over what it comes into contact with, of organic life(and it won't merely lead to a tongue extension, either). I know I'm having trouble typing it. This time, the infected is a man, so we get numerous women that undress in front of, and copulate with, him. Species is kind of a cheap, low-profile, gore-fest kind of horror, that benefited from a fairly impressive cast. This is the direct sequel(where things get bigger, and yet are as, or less, effective), where three cast members return, two of whom in the exact same roles(Madsen and Helgenberger) and the last playing something new based on what she was in the predecessor(Henstridge). Well, actually, that last thing isn't entirely true... her part is basically a cheap and easy way of bringing her back, as it was hard to do so after what happened at the end of the original(which you'll know if you've seen it). The script is basically the writer coming up with a simple, easily explainable way of making a follow-up, and taking it to a slightly higher level, sacrificing common sense in the process. This has a pretty stupid plot, and a good bit of it doesn't make sense. Worse even, some of it leaves you confused, which is almost offensive to even the dumbest of viewers, as the premise of this is about as simple as they come. This has decent pacing; the first time you see it, provided that you're prepared for how bad it is, it may keep your interest for most of the film. The acting ranges... the majority of it is B-movie level and below. I'm not kidding, some of the dummies and animated creatures(the designs are reasonable) in this thing deliver the better performances. The characters aren't particularly interesting or credible. A few of them are clichés and stereotypes, like Dennis Gamble's, who's basically the typical black stereotype... speaking 'ghetto', hunting booty and generally just not really adding anything at all to this. The special effects are somewhat impressive, at least for the time. They hold up pretty well over time, too, including the CGI. That, coupled with an early feeling of optimism that this will eventually improve(which it doesn't, trust me) makes the flick bearable to watch, but it doesn't really have anything worthwhile to offer. I recommend this to those who know what to expect(many hot chicks, nudity, sex and bloody, often grotesque, violence) and, well, want it. 3/10 "},{"Title":"Welcome to the maternity ward... from hell.

Patrick Ross becomes the first person to walk on Mars, he takes various soil samples & heads back to the Excursion. When back on board some strange slime starts to pour out of the sample cannister... Back on Earth the astronauts are treated like hero's but while at a fund raising event Patrick has sex with two débutant's (Nancy La Scala & Raquel Gardener) whose stomachs open up & human like baby alien creatures emerge. Patrick asks his Father Senator Judson Ross (James Cromwell) for help but is ignored as Judson doesn't want any bad publicity, Patrick continues to create alien offspring using various prostitutes, pole dancers & horny housewives. Meanwhile Dr. Orinsky (Baxter Harris) is attacked & killed by Patrick's mutant alien blood & General Carter Burgees (George Dzundza) calls in professional hit man Preston Lennox (Michael Madsen, returning from the original) & Dr. Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger, also an original cast member) who has created Eve (Natasha Henstridge, yet another returnee) from a frozen alien embryo (mentioned in the original) who seems to have a telepathic link with Patrick, but to use Eve's vital ability to it's maximum potential they must turn her almost completely alien...Directed by Peter Medak I have to admit I get a real kick out of Species II & I like it more than the original Species (1995), I just love the thing & for that I apologise to no one. The script by Chris Brancato moves along at a nice pace & is never dull or boring which is always a good start & it features more blood, gore, sex & nudity than just about any other major studio film I can think of. This is pure exploitation for the modern generation! Species II knows that it's all about blood & nudity & doesn't shy away from it, in fact it revels in it! The actual plot is about as silly as you could imagine, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense & is somewhat clichéd & suffers from simplistic one liner type dialogue but what the hell, I just like to sit back & enjoy the bombardment of nastiness that Species II takes great pleasure in serving up. The characters are a bit dumb especially the comic relief black guy & the fat General with one eye but hey, it's all good fun. There are some great gore scenes in Species II, exploding stomachs, a cool effect when Patrick blows his head off with a shotgun & it grows back, slimy alien tentacles, a nasty looking cut up blood splattered corpse on an autopsy table, someone has their guts pulled out & lots of blood splattered all over the shop. Species II doesn't skimp on the sex & nudity either as it's all here, a threesome, straight sex, alien sex, a motel complex full of prostitutes, a strip club & rape. Trivia there is even a deleted scene on the DVD in which Patrick picks up a woman who turns out to be a transsexual so after finding out he breaks her neck. Technically Species II is pretty good, director Medak uses some cool shots like zooming into people's eyes & nice angles like the Star Wars (1979) rip off start as the spaceship zooms across the screen only this time Medak places his camera above it instead of underneath. The special effects are actually very impressive & hold up well even now & don't forget Species II is over 7 years old & that's a long time in effects development. The CGI is solid & doesn't embarrass itself while Steve Johnson & his team pile on the slime & blood in some great yucky over-the-top scenes. The aliens designed by H.R. Giger look organic & visually cool especially Eve although this is where some of the effects become a little bit ropey. I liked the production design with the contrasting hi-tech labs & the old dark run down outhouse building at the end complete with pulsating purple alien cocoons! The acting is not going to win anyone any awards but Madsen as the cool hit man Lennox is likable as usual, strangely the gorgeous Henstridge isn't in the film that much & only gets topless at the end but it's worth the wait boys... Species II is terrific entertainment as far as I'm concerned, I just loved all the nudity sex & gore, I was in heaven! Species II has a bad reputation which is fair enough, but to be honest I don't give a s*it if anyone else likes it because I did & that's all that matters to me. Great entertainment for those with the stomach but anyone with delicate moral sensibilities should stay away...

It was virtually a complete bore and a sequel was most definitely not asked for.  Yet, MGM still went on to make one, which is bad, but unlike the original, it's actually not dull at all. As a matter of fact, it's so full of gratuitous gore and nudity that it never threatens to bore the viewer.  Of course, you have to take in the fact that the script is even worse than the original film's.This time around, we have Eve (Natasha Henstridge) as our titillating female alien who was cloned from Eve.  She's supposedly a good guy, which leads us to the movie's villain, astronaut Patrick Ross (Justin Lazard), who has just returned from an expedition to mars, decisively a changed man.  Apparently, he's been infected with alien DNA and is now on a mission to impregnate as many women as possible, thus leading to the births of young alien children, all of which could possibly lead to the destruction of the human race.I'm laughing as hard as you are.  The plot is simply atrocious, but someone felt obligated to make the film anyway.  I'm sure it was a made for a target audience in mind, most likely young teen males who thrive on gratuitous gore and nudity.  Anybody wanting something resembling intelligence and good taste should avoid at all costs.As a sci-fi film Species 2 is a total failure.  The landing on mars is poorly done with bad special effects.  The film's ideas are basically rehashed off of better (or rather, more entertaining) movies like Lifeforce and Alien.  The alien design is definitely uninspired and is often laughably awful.  This sort of CGI is done in complete overkill, especially in the ludicrous finale.As a horror movie, Species 2 isn't the slightest bit frightening, but it succeeds in doing two things grossing out the viewer and placing a countless and annoying amount of jump scenes.  Justin Lazard isn't a very intidimidating presence, thus for scares you have to rely on his alien form, but as I said before, the visual effect is awful and absolutely ineffective.Keep in mind Species 2 has a desire to outslime its predecessor, which it does.  There are scenes that feature babies popping violently from their mothers' stomachs, a man blows his own head off in graphic fashion, tentacles burst out of people's heads, and so on.  If this is your cup of tea, then by all means drink it up because you'll probably have a good time with this movie.It also feels rather odd for the movie to feature so much nudity.  I do realize that it's an attempt to attract viewers and that it is about women getting impregnated by an alien, but none of the nudity or sex scenes resemble anything near being erotic or titillating, considering all the gore that occurs as the end result.  It just gives the movie a disturbing edge that's more distracting than anything else.  Well, either that or it just adds to the unintentional laughs.  Either way, it doesn't bode well in terms of the movie's quality.I believe it's time to mention the script.  Oh, boy, this thing should be hung in some sort of museum of schlock because it ranks as one of the worst sci-fi pieces ever written for a major studio.  You can tell how ridiculous a movie is when Henstridge's character learns how to drive a car by watching The Dukes of Hazard.  The dialogue's even worse, with actor Mykelti Williamson saying some of the oddest things, like Getting back to Africa on their asses.  The line makes no sense, but it's fitting for a movie with the same problem.Performance-wise, I have to say it's also embarrassingly bad.  With the exception of Marg Helgenberger, everybody else is absolutely horrendous. Mykelti Williamson is forced to say some of the worst dialogue, and as comic relief he's cringe inducing.  Natasha Henstridge and Justin Lazard are easily the worst.  Both are so bland and dull, the effect is unintentionally hilarious.Despite all this, I have to say that Peter Medak's direction is actually fairly decent.  He does nothing groundbreaking but at least he knows how to play the material and he has some sense of pacing, even though it's made mostly uneven by the poor acting and dumb writing.  At least Medak gave a good attempt.The final scenes of Species 2 hint at the prospect of another sequel. Knowing Hollywood, I'm fairly certain it will be made sometime in the near future, most likely as a straight-to-video release.  So, just for now, we're safe.

This time out three astronauts are the first to land on Mars but on their way home there's a seven-minute gap that they can't remember. It turns out one of them (Justin Lazard) is contaminated with alien DNA and now he's impregnating as many women as possible so that they will give birth to alien babies. Back in the lab, Eve (Natasha Henstridge), a replica of the alien from the first film, has a connection to the latest alien while Dr. Baker (Marg Helgenberger) and Lenox (Michael Madsen) try and figure out what to do next. Despite three cast members from the original returning, this film doesn't have any of the originals charm or excitement and in the end you can't help but feel that you're wasting your time watching something that was only made to try and make some quick cash. The movie doesn't work on any level but the biggest sin is the fact that it's deadly boring from the opening scene to the final one. The opening stuff in space just looks plain cheap and the special effects are more laughable than anything else. The end chase tries to recapture the magic of the film film but fails as there's not a bit of suspense and by the time the ending does happen you simply don't care what happens. Everything in the middle is just mind-numbingly bad as we get to see Madsen and Helgenberger discuss what they should do next while evil government official want to do things a different way. Both Madsen and Helgenberger appear to be going by-the-numbers as neither add any life to their characters. The same is true for Lazard who's just not very convincing in his role as the alien. The supporting cast includes Mykelti Williamson, George Dzundza and James Cromwell but none of these fine actors bring much to the film either. Henstridge stays in a cage for the majority of the running time so she doesn't get to add much but thankfully she does strip towards the end of the picture. Peter Boyle appears uncredited and steals the film in his small role. SPECIES II is an ultra-cheap and downright boring sequel that never should have been made but we still have two more films in the series. "}]
