Although I had long been a fan of Altman's 1971 masterpiece, I would probably never have called it the greatest western film. Having sat through most of the Rios, the Searchers, Red River, Stage Coach, the Leone Spaghetti Westerns, and the more current incarnations of the genre (Unforgiven, Dances with Wolves, All the Pretty Horses, et al.), I will say without hesitation that McCabe is a superior film (and a superior western) to all those listed.It is not, of course, a traditional western, nor does it hold true to traditional 'values' of the western. You will not find any rampaging indians, and the typical shots of vast prairies or a surreal Monument Valley. Your hero is a conniving gambler and the heroine is a whore (and one that quite distinctly lacks a heart of gold). They're sympathetic, but they're also quite real with all the faults and foibles humans typically have. The landscape is brown and green; trees are everywhere and it looks like it's wet most of the time (which is appropriate to a film taking place in the Northwest). One of the few cowboys in the film dies in his underwear.By a long shot, then, this is not your typical western, but it is better.The wooden characters of old are replaced with real people to whom we can relate and about whom we can care. Furthermore, the environment - dark, dirty, wet, and all around not terribly inviting - seems more in line with the historical west than the traditional western. The West was not the nicest place to live; it was dangerous and inhospitable as it is in McCabe.I could go on and on about how Altman inverts the western film tradition throughout the movie (as well as how he dismantles the notion that capitalism is a good economic and social system), but I will not. There is no need to treat McCabe that academically. The film is simply wonderful and entertaining - terrific performances, wonderful cinematography, a fascinating story, and great (and very Altman-esque) direction with overlapping conversations and well-handled improvisations. The movie also has the most perfect soundtrack I have ever heard. The songs - by the one and only Leonard Cohen - perfectly match the mood and atmosphere of the film and moreover feel like artifacts of that bygone era depicted in the film. That they were not written or recorded specifically for McCabe is astounding, as they are such an integral and organic part of this film.If you have not seen this film, please do so; it's well worth the time and, unlike Nashville and Short Cuts - Altman's other masterpieces - it's very accessible.

Typical Westerns are set in arid semi-deserts, full of blazing skies, blazing shotguns, and blazing tempers. Here, the dank, chilly Pacific Northwest permits, or rather demands, a different range of emotions poignancy, regret, wintry melancholy. This film takes many risks, using Leonard Cohen's haunting ballads on the soundtrack and shooting scenes in very low light, but remarkably, everything coheres.The film features Altman's trademark group scenes with overlapping dialogue, but not his typical interlocking plot lines. True to its title, the story centers on gambler and brothel owner John McCabe (Warren Beatty) and his shrewd business partner, Mrs. Constance Miller (Julie Christie). Still, supporting characters always hover at the edges, taking part in vignettes that underline the movie's themes and occasionally provide some humor. In this way, the movie avoids the chaos and confusion of some Altman films, while always remaining aware that the main characters are part of a larger community. It's a perfect balance both clear and complex.Still, McCabe & Mrs. Miller is more a study of place and character than a narrative drama. The small, isolated settlement of Presbyterian Church is newly built, but already seems to molder. Ironically, McCabe's brothel is the most civilized place in town it is built quickly and even gets painted, while the church remains half-finished. No families, parents or children live in this bleak town, just a bunch of weary miners and whores who delude and distract themselves. They all have dreams, but barely know how to achieve them; for this reason, they're sympathetic and all too human. McCabe is a true anti-hero, a guy who thinks he's a slick, wisecracking gambler, but his jokes fall flat and he lacks common sense. Mrs. Miller seems confident and shameless, but she secretly uses opium to dispel the pain of living. At times, the movie is well aware of how it subverts the clichés of the Western genre to reflect what would really have happened out West. For instance, there is a final shootout, but it arises because of a quarrel over business&#151;there are no Indians, no outlaws, and no sheriffs here! But McCabe & Mrs. Miller is much more than just a clever exercise in revisionism; it's never overtly satirical or mean-spirited. It keenly observes its world and then comments on it, overlaying everything with a delicate sense of poignancy and loss. This is the kind of film that stays with you, but not because of sharp dialogue, beautiful images, or showy performances. Greater than the sum of its parts, McCabe & Mrs. Miller is memorable for the pervasive but understated mood that runs through every frame, creating a truly atmospheric and humanistic film.

The ordinary ones attach themselves to the narrative, usually the spoken narrative, so we get faces and clear, ordered speech to tell us what is going on. These are the most formulaic because there are after all only so many stories that are presentable.Some attach themselves to characters, dig in and let those characters deliver a tale and situation. Often with the Italians and Italian-Americans, the camera swoops on a tether attached to these characters. I consider this lazy art unless there is some extraordinary insight into the relationship between actor and character.And then there the few who attach themselves to a sense, a tone, a space. That situation has ideas and stories and talk, but they are only there as reflections from the facets of the place. Of the three, this is the hardest to do well; that's why so few try. And of those that do, most convey style only, not a place, not a whole presentation of the way the world works.This film is about the best example I know where the world is 'real,' the situation governs everything and the primary substance is the presentation of a Shakespearian quality cosmology of fate.The camera moves not so much with the story, but it enters and leaves. And there is not just one story, but many that we catch in glimpses. Words just appear in disorder as they do in life. Not everything is served up neat. We drift with the same arbitrariness as McCabe. It is not as meditative as 'Mood for Love' as it has something we can interpret as a story to distract us.So as a matter of craft, this is an important film, one with painful fishhooks that stick. Beatty had already reinvented Hollywood with 'Bonny,' and was a co- conspirator in this. (If you are into double bills, see it with 'The Claim,' which is intended as a distanced remake/homage, that obliquely references Warren.)Quite apart from the craft of the thing, and the turning of the Western on its head long before 'Unforgiven,' there are other values- the notion that actors are imported into a fictional world as whores. Not a new idea for sure, but so seamlessly and subtly injected here, it becomes just another one of the background stories. (Also referenced in 'Unforgiven.')- the business about the preacher trying to wrestle some old school order from the overwhelming mechanics of arbitrary fate. This is the director's stance.- the final concept that the whole thing, McCabe and church and all is an opium dream of the aptly named 'Constance,' dimly reinterpreting other events after the fashion of 'Edwin Drood.'Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3 Every cineliterate person should experience this.

This film can be called a western because of its settings, but if anything, this is a revisionist western (à la Clint Eastwood's more recent Unforgiven, a film that also subverted all the clichés and morales of this traditionally macho genre). And, more than anything, it's a love story.John McCabe (Warren Beatty), charismatic but no so smart, sets up a whorehouse in the Old West. Constance Miller (Julie Christie), beautiful, strong and determined, soon arrives in town and offers to run the business and share the profits with McCabe. They start a tempestuous relationship while business thrives... but when a major corporation tries to buy McCabe & Mrs. Miller's enterprise, McCabe refuses to sell it. It's the beginning of his, her and the town's doom.Even when exploring such a visual genre as the western (and visually the film is also very compelling, with great use of real snow and a beautifully shot duel on a bridge), Altman uses one of his most notorious trademarks the overlapping dialogue, commonly used in ensembles but also wisely used in a more intimate, character-driven story like this. It works very well, although the 1 on 1 dialogues are deeply insightful themselves (the scene when Christie teaches a very young widow, played by Shelley Duvall, how she is supposed to behave in her new job, is brief, human, and dry). Beatty gives one of his most subtle, captivating performances, and Christie empowers Mrs. Miller with flesh and blood - she was definitely one of the most beautiful and intriguing actresses of her time, alongside Faye Dunaway and Jane Fonda, who set up a standard for beautiful, strong women who were much more than sheer eye candy. McCabe and Mrs. Miller's relationship is so fascinating that even the bang bang fans will be drawn into it and root for them to end together. So, next time someone says Clint Eastwood reinvented the western with his masterpiece Unforgiven, remember 21 years before, Altman had experimented and succeeded on that with his McCabe & Mrs. Miller. Because love stories are more than kisses and happy endings, and westerns go beyond blood and testosterone.

There are no sweeping vistas of the Great Plains, no Indians, no cacti, no cowboy hats. There is no sheriff, no broiling sun, and no corny music. And unlike most Westerns, which are plot driven, McCabe & Mrs. Miller is less about plot than about the tone or mood of the frontier setting.The film takes place in the Pacific Northwest. The weather is cold, cloudy, and inclement. You can hear the wind howling through tall evergreens. And Leonard Cohen's soft, poetic music accentuates the appropriately dreary visuals. In bucking cinematic tradition, therefore, this film deserves respect, because it is at least unusual, and perhaps even closer in some ways to the ambiance of life on the American frontier than our stereotyped notions, as depicted in typical John Wayne movies.Not that the plot is unimportant. Warren Beatty plays John McCabe, a two-bit gambler who imports several prostitutes to a tiny town, in hopes of making money. Julie Christie plays Mrs. Miller, a prostitute with a head for business. She hears about McCabe's scheme, and approaches McCabe with an offer he can't refuse. Soon, the two are in business together, but complications ensue when word gets around that McCabe may be a gunslinger who has killed someone important. Mrs. Miller is clearly a symbol of the women's liberation movement, and the film's ending is interesting, in that context.McCabe & Mrs. Miller is a vintage Altman film, in that you can hear background chatter, in addition to the words of the main character. It's Altman's trademark of overlapping dialogue. The film's acting is fine. Both Beatty and Christie perform credibly in their roles.The visuals have a turn-of-the-century look, with a soft, brownish hue. Costumes and production design are elaborate, and appear to be authentic. The film is very dark, so dark in some scenes that I could barely make out the outline of human figures. In those scenes, I think they went overboard with the ultra dim lighting.Strictly atypical for the Western genre, McCabe & Mrs. Miller provides a pleasant change from cinematic stereotypes, and conveys a different perspective on life in the Old West. It's a quality production, one that has Robert Altman's directorial stamp all over it. In that sense, it's more like a cinematic painting than a story. And the painting communicates to the viewer that life on the American frontier was, at least in some places, cold and dreary, and had a quietly poetic quality to it.

In fact, it's not really a western at all; certainly not like any western I've ever seen. It's setting is the Pacific Northwest; cold, rainswept and often covered in snow. There are gunslingers but they are more like the professional hit men of gangster movies. When Altman isn't filming through the haze of a rain-drenched exterior he is filming through the haze of a dimly lit interior where darkness is more prevalent than light. Above all, it doesn't have a conventional western hero. McCabe is like a tragi-comic Everyman out of his depth and his territory in this largely alien environment yet canny enough to apply his savvy into transforming the landscape into something tangible, real and materialistically American.In this respect it is a very modern film in spite of its setting. The fact that Altman doesn't care very much about convention or even about narrative, (it's story is perfunctory; Altman is more interested in 'observing'), makes it so. But then MASH wasn't a conventional war movie either just as Nashville wasn't really about the country music business.As for McCabe himself, Beatty plays him with the same laconic, stammering mannerisms he applies to all his roles, (and which he seems either blessed or cursed with in real life), and which actually makes him a perfect Altman hero, (or anti-hero, if you prefer). Mrs Miller, on the other hand, seems coolly distracted from what's going on around her. Julie Christie plays up her Englishness adding another element to the alienation of her character, a stranger in a strange land indeed, while in the foreground the songs of Leonard Cohen seem to hover like warm blankets, cosily familiar and comforting even at their bleakest. They could have been written for the film.

They partner up and establish the best lil' whorehouse in town. This is quite the unconventional western, and it is executed so perfectly as only the great Robert Altman could do.I loved the whole process of the film. I liked the characters and wanted to see them succeed. When things go bad, as they often do, some very tense sequences ensue. Men are hired to kill McCabe for not negotiating with the right people. There is one part where he first meets the man hired to kill him that is so nerve-wrecking, but so amusing at the same time. I mean, it's pretty clear early on that McCabe is a bit of a buffoon, but I think this is the crucial point in the film when we know we really care about his fate.Wonderfully acted by Warren Beatty and Julie Christie in the lead roles(as well as the supporting cast), being in the hands of Robert Altman, and with some great music by Leonard Cohen, McCabe & Mrs. Miller proves itself as a great, great movie.

This could possibly be the best film ever made.  Upon my first time seeing this  masterpiece, I half paid attention, but got enough out of it to realize that it  demanded a second viewing.  By the time I had realized I wanted to see this film  again, I came to the conclusion that I had to own it.   I gave it a serious look once  I bought it on DVD, and am continuously drawn into its world no matter howmany times I watch it, it only gets better.        Powerful is one of the many words which comes to mind, the film starts out  beautifully, and subtly becomes deeper as it progresses and the layers are piled  on.  The stratas are wove together  like a sublime tapestry or an orchestralmovement by Mozart.  It begins simply with one note, and becomes a hauntingly  rich harmony.         The best scenes, the ones which stuck with me for days and months after,  are the opening sequence with Mccabe riding in on the horse, with theabsolutely perfectly chosen Leonard Cohen soundtrack (Altman tells of listening  to Leonard Cohen so much before filming Mccabe and Mrs. Miller, that hesubconsciously thinks set the tone of the film to a Leonard Cohen soundtrack,  which he then added after the film was shot) The scene where Julie Christie is  in bed after smoking opium and hiding under the covers like a playful childwhile Mccabe says you're a funny little woman, and the most powerful scene in  the film, the innocent cowboy being gunned down on the bridge by the kid whois trying to be a big man in front of his gang.  Of course I left out all the brilliant  camera work which fits perfectly, never a gratuitous pan or close up, and the  final scene of Julie Christie smoking opium while on the bed.      In nearly every scene a fire is lit, whether it is a lamp, fire from a fire place, or  the church burning in the final scene, fire permeates this film.  The warm orange  glow of the fireplace in conjunction with Mccabe's giant orange coat, the orange  hued leaves lightly pelted with rain, and the warming effect Julie Christie casts  from the effects of the opium weave together synergistically, serving as a stark  contrast to the wind and snow in the barren newly constructed frontier town.      The genius of Altman, lies in shocking the audience, he is a master magician  and master of surprise.  It is brilliant that he made a western in the middle of  winter, it is fantastic that he made the hero an anti-hero, it is magical the entire  film came together seamlessly.

He appears in the ramshackle mining town of Presbyterian Church, somewhere in the wilds of Washington state at the turn of the 20th Century, and builds a whorehouse and saloon. Constance Miller (Julie Christie), also sporting her own mound of unkempt hair, arrives a little later and becomes McCabe's business partner. She knows much more about running a whorehouse at a profit, and it quickly becomes clear that she's the brains behind the operation. These two develop a timid affection for one another that's never overtly expressed, but their relationship doesn't have time to prosper, as a trio of hit men arrive to rub out McCabe after he refuses to sell his holdings to a corporation intent on buying him out.Not surprisingly, considering the director, McCabe & Mrs. Miller is a strange film. There are virtually no scenes given to outright plot exposition or to showy acting. Much of the plot is conveyed through asides, casual glances and subtle nuances. Wilderness life is shown in all its unglamorous detail, and many of the normally familiar actors are unrecognizable behind their bad teeth, greasy hair and dirty faces. The harsh environment is a character itself, and few movies have a more memorable ending, with McCabe engaged in a most unconventional shoot out amid waist-high drifts of snow.Altman is of course interested in debunking the usual Western myths. There are no heroes to be found here. McCabe is a decent enough guy, but he's a bit of a fool, and when the bad guys come calling, he runs and hides. The American frontier depicted here is not a sacred place waiting for brave and noble men to come and realize their dreams. Instead, it's a brutal and dangerous wasteland, in which only the craftiest can survive. The theme of corporate exploitation that pervades the film still rings resoundingly to a present-day audience.But for all its harshness, McCabe & Mrs. Miller is a beautiful film to look at. Vilmos Zsigmond bathes everything in an ethereal light, and if there are images of icy starkness, there are also reverse images of rich warmth, notably those that take place in the whorehouse itself, which ironically becomes much more of a civilizing agent and cultural epicenter for the small town than the church that figures so prominently in other ways.One of the best from Altman's golden period as a director, and one of the best films to emerge from any director in the 1970s.Grade A "},{"Title":"Windex, please.","Date":"15 May 2005","Score":"27 out of 45 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Western","Review":" *McCabe and Mrs. Miller* takes place in the turn-of-the-century Pacific Northwest. Into a soggy, muddy mining camp John McCabe (a hirsute Warren Beatty) comes barging, full of cigar smoke and big ideas about building a proper saloon/whorehouse for the town, replete with a trio of the sorriest whores in movie history. He also comes with an unearned reputation as a gunslinger too shameful about this to blatantly advertise it, but not exactly afraid to use it in order to assert alpha-male credentials amongst the locals. And thus he wrangles the boys into building his saloon at the rate of 15 cents an hour.It looks to be a rather sorry operation until Mrs. Miller (Julie Christie) shows up on a startling contraption that's half-railroad car, half-automobile (where did Altman find that thing?). Mrs. Miller immediately takes on McCabe as a business partner, with the aim of classing up the new joint with proper whores and an insistence that all visitors take a bath before entering. Noting that McCabe doesn't know how to add, she also insists on handling the accounts. It's not clear what McCabe's function will be.The plot thickens when a pair of oily representatives from the mining company show up in town and offer McCabe to buy him out for five grand. McCabe tells them to buzz off -- he's holding out for fifteen thousand. The company finds negotiation distasteful, so they hire a trio of assassins to simply kill McCabe . . . though how they think they can get away with murdering a man in broad daylight in the center of town is as unclear as McCabe's function in the whorehouse partnership. (Excusing this whopping plot hole on the grounds that the locals would be too cowed to talk doesn't cut the mustard when one considers that any reward-money offered by the local Marshal would be pretty tempting.) *McCabe and Mrs. Miller*, purportedly classic Seventies cinema, should be a lot better than it is. The movie tells a pretty good story; the main characters have the potential to be interesting. There are some striking scenes, especially one involving what looks to be a 14-year-old stone-cold killer. But it's really, really hard to enjoy a movie when you can hardly hear what anyone is saying and when you can hardly see what anyone is doing. Once again, this director hijacks his own movie with sheer barnyard laziness and sloppiness. According to the trivia-sheet here on IMDb, the movie's editor griped to Altman that the sound was muddy; Altman disagreed; and when everyone said the sound was muddy after the movie's release, Altman blamed the editor. (Nice.) Along with the bad sound, the movie has an atrocious look. Only Robert Altman can hire a world-class DP like Vilmos Zsigmond and make a movie that looks as if they sprayed the camera lenses with dirty dishwater. Reviewers here who praise the dark brown glow of this picture have GOT to be kidding me. The interiors are shot through what appears to be a dark scum. The exterior photography is even worse it's as if Altman placed 500 fog machines behind the copious trees. During the climactic stretch, when Beatty is dodging the assassins while the local church is on fire, Altman insists on pretty much wholly obscuring the view with an animated snow-fall that reminds one of a Rankin-Bass Christmas special.Look -- I can't watch a movie under these conditions. Get back to me when you learn how to place boom mikes, when you remove all that annoying Altman-esque overlapping dialog, and when you wipe the lenses with some Windex, or something. 3 stars out of 10.

'McCabe and Mrs. Miller' has a dense realistic texture rarely seen in movies, which goes beyond mere visual authenticity, giving equal prominence to sound, most obviously Altman's trademark overlapping dialogue, where the main characters' words are part of an overall, frequently indistinct aural pattern, but also in the kind of irrelevant off-plot asides, the scraping of chairs, the distant sound of music, the beating of the snow etc., that doesn't just create an atmosphere against which the main players are foregrounded, but give a tangible illusion of messy, lived experience.Altman and Renoir come at this texture from opposite directions, though. Where Renoir used genre (a love triangle/murder plot) to reveal the artificiality of realism, Altman uses realism to emasculate the artificiality of genre.  'McCabe' comes from a period in Altman's filmmaking when he was taking hoary male genres, encrusted with formulae, and deconstructing their assumptions - M*A*S*H, the great anti-war anti-war-film; 'The Long Goodbye', the great anti-detective film; 'Thieves Like Us', the great anti-gangster film.This makes Altman's project sound like Godard's, a way of foregrounding, uncovering, critiquing established cinematic codes and modes.  But where Godard foregrounds these genres' artifice, Altman adopts an almost pedantic realism.  'Mccabe' begins with the archetypal Western beginning, a mysterious stranger enters a town.  Sure enough, he has a 'rep' as a notorious gunfighter.  The film ends with an equally archetypal ending, the elaborate shootout.But even these cliches aren't what we might expect - McCabe/Beatty lost and unrecognisable in a huge bear-skin coat, mumbling to himself, is hardly the lean, mean, menacing outlaw we might expect; while the shoot-out, far from being a ritual, theatrical, exorcising public rite, is instead a fumbled game of hide and seek far away from a public eye busily rescuing a burning church no-one attends.In between, the film may as well not be a Western if we accept that term as a genre with rules and characters.  There is a tart with a heart; there is a public humiliation scene; there is an entrepeneur who builds a town and a community out of a desert, this time a snowy, gravel one.  But narrative seems to get lost in the textural fuzz, just as Beatty's words (never the most distinct in movies!) get lost in the general babble.  For a hero, McCabe spends most of the time shuffling around, belching, trying to be the big man, when he clearly isn't.  In this way, Altman succeeds where his contemporary iconoclasts Peckinpah and Leone failed; by using genre to critique it, they never quite removed its pleasures.But this is not to suggest that 'McCabe' is a negative experience.  It is probably Altman's warmest, most human film, as well as being supremely funny.  The rare set-piece, such as Keith Carradine's goof on the bridge with a psycho teenage thug shocks because it is so unexpected.  The extended asides - the poker games; the prostitutes' first bathing; the ceili on the ice; McCabe's hopeless business negotiations - are supremely pleasurable in themselves, for their vivid detail, their rooting in character.But this is never realism.  Altman's camera is constantly imposing itself, focusing the viewer's attention, leading him astray (especially in the crucial scene where McCabe and Mrs. Miller sleep together, and the camera stalls on the box of money, a completely misleading shot), taking him out of the realism, and into questioning Altman's formal motives.  The elaborate, often multi-frame, compositions are 'unrealistically' pregnant.  In any case, Leonard Cohen's opening song gives the film away before the credits have ended!  Or does it?  The profusion of mirrors and frames suggest we don't take anything at face value, least of all Altman.

It's an incredible achievement, it reaches a level of greatness so high, you feel like your eyes will never witness such cinematic perfection, such documentary-like authenticity, such beauty in ugliness. This film captures the end of the Old Western Myth through the fate of one of the most fascinating movie characters John McCabe, brilliantly portrayed by Warren Beatty.John McCabe embodies the Old West myth through his complex but charismatic personality. Here is a good-hearted man, a man who claims to be a businessman, but who seems to carry something deeply hidden in his conscience, in his soul. Whether it's a strength or a weakness, we can't tell in the beginning of the film. Some said he killed a guy? Is is true? McCabe doesn't care. He's here for business and means it. He builds a saloon, and supplies the distraction to the future inhabitants of the modest Presbyterian Church, a little but promising town, in the middle of nowhere. McCabe is respected because he's got charisma, humor, and the money to make him the richest, therefore the most powerful man in town. He's a strong character, a true leader with a beard like the mane of a lion whom he also seems to have the heart. Until the second protagonist of the film, Mrs. Miller, comes.Mrs. Miller, a peculiar little woman who makes the lion look like a lamb. She talks straight-forwardly, she's a whore and proposes to provide her experience in the whore business, in other words, a partnership. The way she handles the negotiation is so convincing even McCabe can't resist. But not because he's a visionary but because he liked her at first sight, even though he has too much pride to admit it. And this movie becomes one of the greatest and most poignant romances ever portrayed.McCabe isn't meant to be a leader, though he tries to act like one, but this is no Ford or Hawks's film. McCabe is too fragile, too human. Mrs. Miller is the tougher one and she realizes it soon. They're different, but they're complementary. And she wants to protect him, because she, too, developed a fondness for him (it wouldn't have been a romance otherwise) The tragedy of their romance is that if Mrs. Miller had McCabe's personality and vice versa, things would have probably turned differently, for good. But it didn't. McCabe goofing around lead him to commit a fatal mistake. When two agents from a major corporation offer to buy him out, he doesn't get the idea and he bargains. McCabe is just too tragically dumb to figure out that his refusal to sign the contract signed his own death warrant. How ironic, this man who doesn't want to share his money, his land, still accepts to share the woman he loves. There's no place for good-hearted men, it's the time of industry, business and majors and McCabe already belongs to another era. One particular scene illustrates this idea, and it's almost painful to remember it. It's the famous bridge scene, a reminiscent of Elisha Cook Jr.'s character death in Shane. The victim is a gentle funny looking kid who spent good time with the whores and happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong moment. Never had a death shocked me and saddened me so much. The guy was good-hearted, like McCabe, and he was killed because as soon as he crossed the bridge facing that little punk (one of the few characters I couldn't wait to see die), he couldn't go back, even by acting friendly. Just like McCabe sealed his fate and wasn't even given the choice to reconsider the offer. Miller knew he was doomed, Miller, also too proud to admit her love, making her partner a customer even in love. Money was just her shell, but look at her in the bed scene when she's smiling to him, the light shining from her eyes is nothing but love, and this is the most beautiful smile ever captured in film.McCabe's demise is another tribute to the greatness of the film. The guy is chased by the colossal villainous Butler and his two side-kicks including the previously mentioned punk. What does McCabe do? He chickens out, and tries to escape, at least this is his first reaction. Another element that makes us feel so much sympathy for McCabe, forget Eastwood's speech in Unforgiven  'Hell of a thing killing a man'. It doesn't need words in Altman's masterpiece, just show McCabe running from death and we get the idea. This climactic sequence is so thrilling we feel like being chased with McCabe. And when he kills the villains one by one, this concludes his fascinating story arc by denying Butler's statement McCabe never killed a guy before. After all, the guy might be human, fragile, dead, but he's the Old West.As McCabe is slowly buried in snow, Mrs. Miller is in an opium den, looking at the light with melancholy, feeling like a precious part of herself is progressively fading to death ... melancholy, snow, death, we're absorbed in an ocean of emotions we wouldn't expect from a western, a feeling of profound sadness, why such awful things happen to good people, why? because no matter why, when something comes to an end, it must end. It's called tragedy, it's tragically sad ... this is the saddest movie I've seen, the end of an era, of a myth, of a genre. It doesn't preach sadness, it just illustrates the doom of living in a world where a good heart has nowhere to live, and two good hearts nowhere to live together.

Cards on the table, I preferred the TV M.A.S.H. to the movie version and didn't laugh once during the original movie. This off-beat western with A-list casting sort of missed me too. Multi-layered, my TV guide said, well I couldn't get through the top crust. Yes it was well shot, in mostly natural light and Altman creates a beautiful snowy tableau for McCabe's demise but where was the story? Perhaps I wasn't comfortable with the depiction of women in the film, Julie Christie apart, as good-for-one-thing whores. There was little humour to leaven the seedy subject matter and just so little narrative drive about the piece. If it was about the supposed love affair between Warren Beatty's McCabe and Christie's Mrs Miller, I didn't get that either. Was it maybe about little-town ideals being corrupted by big business? I don't know, I found watching it that whole minutes had gone by without anything notable happening and having to concentrate to stay interested. I also found the movie very poorly dubbed - I'm British and I still found much of what Christie said to be unintelligible with the rest of the mostly male cast slurring or mumbling their words too. There was a lot of indiscriminate killing for little reason that I could see and little drama or excitement to savour. Perhaps I should watch it again and try harder to absorb its layers but to be truthful, I doubt I'd get much past 20 minutes. "},{"Title":"McCabe and McCloud","Date":"22 May 2008","Score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Western","Review":" Like most Westerns, Robert Altman's McCabe and Mrs Miller begins with a mysterious loner arriving at a remote town. His name's John McCabe (Warren Beaty), and the town in question is Presbyterian Church, a small settlement at the edge of Washington State. Immediately the townsfolk regard McCabe with suspicion. He claims to be a simple gambler, but rumour has it that he shot and killed a gunfighter called Billy Roundtree.An opportunist and small-time entrepreneur, McCabe decides to set up a small bar and brothel. Something simple. Nothing fancy. And so he hires a trio of prostitutes, commissions a few local men and starts work on his enterprise. Enter Constance Miller (Julie Christie), a professional hooker with her own troupe of girls. She becomes McCabe's business partner, but gradually begins to take control of his finances. Whilst McCabe lacks business savvy and simply wants to set up a place to gamble, Mrs Miller has larger ambitions. She wants to make lots of fast cash and doesn't have time for small minded runts like McCabe. Though seemingly incompatible - she loves certainty, he's a gambler, she's a realist, he's a dreamer - McCabe and Mrs Miller gradually fall in love. It's a subdued romance, but affecting all the same, primarily because we sense that McCabe is lonely and looking for love. I got poetry in me, he says, but Mrs Miller refuses to get too close. As Presbyterian Church blossoms into a successful community, a pair of agents from the Harrison mining company arrive. They want to buy out McCabe's business, but McCabe says no. Big mistake. Harrison is notorious for having people killed when they refuse to sell. McCabe contacts lawyers with the hope of protecting himself, but it's no use. Three gunmen appear at the edge of town and McCabe is forced to confront them. He kills them all, but dies himself to a mortal wound. The film ends. Business continues.Audiences didn't know what to make of McCabe and Mrs Miller when it was first released. Altman is a director who thrives on shapelessness and confusion. His films buzz with the dangerous thrill of collaboration. The unplanned zooms, the improvising actors, the swirling sound design, it's all initially very off-putting.Still, as a revisionist Western the film is endlessly fascinating, Altman systematically reversing many western conventions the classic set up with the stranger coming to town, the saloons, the gunfights...he treats them all with a fresh or skewed approach.Likewise, John McCabe lacks the typical swagger we've come to expect from our Western heroes. McCabe is vulnerable, clumsy and unlucky with the ladies. In contrast, Mrs. Miller is very much the man of the picture. A world weary business woman, her head always in books, she's pragmatic to the point of ruthlessness. Yes, we sense her feelings for McCabe. But they're feelings which she keeps at bay. She has to if she wishes to survive.The film's tone was deemed shocking at the time. It featured a cast of lusty men and grimy prostitutes, sex is pervasive, and Altman repeatedly subverts religion and mysticism. Whilst countless Westerns play up their apocalyptic endings, for example, Altman has a church burn down without significance and as dryly as possible. This isn't a mythical clash between good and evil, just another day on the frontier.The film's setting is also unique, Altman constructing a huge village in the mountains of British Columbia. A far cry from John Ford's Monument Valley, Altman's landscape is one of rotten wood, mud, ice sheets and howling winds. All these traits have led to some calling McCabe an anti-western, but on one level it is most other westerns that are anti western, trading in a wholly myopic view of the frontier life. Altman, meanwhile, is more interested in sketching the kinds of real hardships that were responsible for building America. His is a world of constant struggle, toil, corporate exploitation, violent business savvy and personal tragedy. But he also captures the entrepreneurial spirit and camaraderie that allowed these budding communities to form and prosper.Being a film which reverses the idealizations promulgated by the genre, it's no surprise that McCabe and Mrs Miller, like Altman's previous film, Brewster McCloud, deals almost exclusively with both the literal and metaphorical death of romantic idealism. Women turn up to Presbyterian Church with dreams of riches and wealth, only to find mud, rain and an incomplete brothel. Similarly, one woman hopes to find peace and marriage, but promptly finds herself working as a prostitute when her husband dies. Altman extends this naivety, this profound disappointment or disillusionment, to everyone in the film, even McCabe himself. McCabe prides himself as a gambler and bluffer, only to find himself unable to negotiate a price with the Mining Company. Later a lawyer boasts that McCabe will soon be a legend and hero for standing up to and defeating the mighty corporations. McCabe is gunned down the following day.Similarly, a boasting cowboy visits a brothel, only to have his genitals mocked. Altman even extends this naivety to the bad guys. McCabe's never fired a shot in his life, one gunman says. He dies to McCabe's bullet the following day.Time and again, Altman shows the price of naivety, of idealism, building things up until that final moment when all hopes of a union between McCabe and Mrs Miller are shattered. With the death of both McCabe and a young, innocent cowboy, Altman shows that the literal death of good and innocence is consummate with the metaphorical death of romantic idealism. 9/10 &#x96; Worth multiple viewings. "},{"Title":"A Sombre Beauty","Date":"12 December 2007","Score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Western","Review":" This film is an example of what has been called the revisionist Western. The traditional Western had often presented an idealised, highly moralistic, picture of the Old West as a place where the brave, honourable men in the white hats took on the villainous criminals in the black hats and almost invariably came out on top. The revisionists tried to undermine this picture by presenting us with a world where good did not always triumph over evil- a world, indeed, where the lines between good and evil were often blurred. The heyday of the traditional Western was in the forties and fifties, significantly the era of World War II and the early days of the Cold War. There were, of course, Westerns from these decades where moral boundaries were by no means clear-cut, but they tended to be a minority; when film-makers of the period wanted to deal in moral ambiguity they often turned to other genres, such as film noir. By the late sixties and early seventies, however, the revisionists were in the ascendant, possibly because events such as the Vietnam War had caused many Americans to question some of their most cherished beliefs about their country.McCabe and Mrs Miller is a film which takes its revisionism rather further than some. Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch is sometimes quoted as the quintessential revisionist Western, and it certainly shows us the West as a harsh, pitiless place. Yet although Peckinpah shows us both his criminal protagonists and their enemies as brutal and ruthless, he also mythologises the brutality and ruthlessness of the Bunch, particularly in the final battle scene in which they achieve a sort of epic grandeur. Tom Gries's Will Penny demythologises the West by showing us the cowboy not as hero but as average working man, but keeps the moral distinction between the sympathetic Penny and his villainous adversaries.Robert Altman's film is different to either. It is set in the early twentieth century in a small logging town in the Pacific North-West- a late date and an unusual location for a Western. The town goes by the name of Presbyterian Church, but the local residents, mostly male, have things other than religion on their minds. John McCabe is an entrepreneur who arrives in town with a scheme to make his fortune by setting up a tavern-cum-brothel. The sex industry is not a field of business in which he has any experience, but he goes into partnership with Constance Miller, an English hooker turned madam, and at first their enterprise proves a great success. Their success, however, proves to be their undoing. A powerful corporation wants to take over the town and makes McCabe an offer to buy out his holdings. He thinks the price is too low and refuses, not realising that the people with whom he is dealing will resort to anything, including violence, to get what they want and that this is the proverbial offer he cannot refuse.The plot is a relatively simple one, much more so than some of Altman's other films, such as Short Cuts with its collection of interlocking stories or Gosford Park with its multiple sub-plots. I felt, in fact, that the film was too long and in parts too slow-moving and that the simple story could have been better told in a more compact form. When I first saw it I occasionally found it difficult to follow, largely because of the director's frequent use of overlapping conversations, although I found it more comprehensible on a second viewing.There are, however, compensations. The film is set in autumn and winter; the indoor scenes are dark, lit only by oil lamps and log fires, and the outdoor ones are dull, with overcast skies, rain and snow. (The final scenes take place in a snowstorm). The dominant tones are greys and browns, but from this limited palette Altman is able to achieve a sombre beauty. Indeed, this is visually one of the most beautiful films ever made, one of those films where almost every shot is composed like a painting. Leonard Cohen's haunting songs fit the mood of the film perfectly.There is no epic grandeur about this film, the sordid tale of a brothel-keeper who gets himself shot because of his greed and stupidity. His death goes unnoticed by his fellow townsmen, who are more worried about the fact that the local church has caught fire. This is no story out of which legends are made, like the Gunfight at the OK Corral or Custer's Last Stand. It is the sort of story which might merit a few brief paragraphs on the crime page of a local newspaper. By 1971 the Western had, by and large, ceased to celebrate the triumph of Good over Evil. In Altman's vision it ceased to celebrate anything of any note. This is the only Western the director made, and he significantly referred to it as an anti-Western. Yet he managed to produce from this sordid and mundane subject-matter a strange, hauntingly beautiful film. 7/10 "},{"Title":"I don't think Altman liked westerns.","Date":"3 May 2006","Score":"7 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Western","Review":" I think Robert Altman looked down upon the world of country music when he made Nashville, and also on the fashion world when he made 'Pret a Porter'. In 'McCabe', Altman tries to keep distance from anything that might resemble a western, even though it is a western story. Make no mistake, 'McCabe' is a very good film, but the effort to be a non western goes against it. John Wayne and Howard Hawks did not like 'High Noon' because when three gunfighters came to get Gary Cooper, the people in the town did not help. They thought that would not happen in real life, that people are better than that. That is not my point of view, but what can we say about 'McCabe', that when three men show up to get Warren Beatty, the town's people are either alienated or even help them? And what about Julie Christie who just cops out smoking opium? One of the men kills a cowboy for no reason whatsoever in a shocking scene. Is this the true west without the myth? Does the fact that it is cruel make it more real?.Warren Beatty's interpretation of McCabe is great, perhaps his best, he is the good innocent person taking a task too big for him, considering the people he is dealing with. You really wish that he would come out winning.

It's beautiful to watch (the cinematography is gorgeous), the music is very melancholic and does a wonderful job setting the mood of the film. I'd never seen a western that captured so well and so realistically the lives of regular townspeople and how they mingled and interacted with one another. About the film itself, I'll say this although there're some of the filmmaker's trademarks throughout the film (quirky and interesting characters, dark humor) , I found it to be the least Altmanesque of his movies in that it's much more linear and sequential and not a series of story lines coming together. The performances are nuanced and subtle, darkly humorous at times, and very realistic. The sheer aesthetic value of the film is immense; I found myself immediately drawn by the images and transported back to a West that truly seemed other-wordly as seen by these characters. In short, what makes this film so different is not the story (which is entertaining, mind you) nor the performances (which are memorable), but how it depicts the West. It is in the capturing of that atmosphere and in transporting the viewer to that time and place that the film really shines.This movie is listed as one of the 1001 to watch before you die; I can totally see why, and although I'm not planning to, If I did die I would do so knowing that my last movie-watching experience was a truly fulfilling one (which is more than I can say for several of the films listed in the book). I would recommend this movie for any fan of revisionist westerns, Robert Altman or slow-building, moody films; I wouldn't recommend it for anyone seeking an action-packed, shoot'em up kind of movie.

It is the story of a tiny mining town desperately attempting to make something of itself and not be lost in the obligatory snow and cold of its surroundings. It is also a tale of American capitalism and manifest destiny; these people are here not just to do something but because they feel they are commissioned by God himself.It is also a deconstruction of the Western myth. There are no prairie landscapes, wide-open roads lined up with saloons and small businesses on each side. The sun doesn't shine on this part of the world; Presbyterian Church it would seem, as been forgotten by civilization. However, two people attempt to solve that issue by way of establishing business and capital within the skeletal remains of the town. McCabe, a shrewd businessman with little common sense, brings it to life by starting up a saloon and brothel. Slowly, it begins to take form but things really take off when a breathtaking Cockney shows up Mrs. Miller.They form a delicate partnership, though neither fully trusts the other and soon the town is advanced years ahead of what it once was. Yet, all this narrative description doesn't begin to scratch the surface of what writer/director Robert Altman is getting at. The cinematography is particularly unique, giving off a foggy, downtrodden feeling to the already cold and isolated atmosphere of the town. The acting is also very fitting to the style of Altman's storytelling; people come and go without any real introduction and we seem to only be able to catch up with them. The camera is used as a third-party observer, floating throughout the set pieces while picking up bits and pieces of conversations. Nothing is really permanent here, except the people and their feelings of missed opportunities and lost causes.

During post-production on this film, 'Robert Altman' was having a difficult time finding a proper musical score, until he attended a party where the album Songs of Leonard Cohen was playing and noticed that several songs from the album seemed to fit in with the overall mood and themes of the movie . Cohen, who had been a fan of Altman's previous film, Brewster McCloud (1970), allowed him to use three songs from the album - The Stranger Song, Sisters of Mercy and Winter Lady . Colorful and evocative cinematography in Panavisión by classic cameraman Vilmos Zsigmond , giving a rich texture on the Western atmosphere .The motion picture was well directed by Robert Altman who offers an adequate image of Western period , as he deglamorizes ordinary mood with his realist sights . At the beginning Altman realized Shorts and he then went to Hollywood to direct Alfred Hitchcock's TV show . From here, he went on to direct a large number of television shows, until he was offered the script for ¨M.A.S.H.¨ (1970) in 1969 . This wasn't his first movie , but it was his first success . He was hardly the producer's first choice - more than fifteen other directors had already turned it down .

Altman is in good form and Beatty is miraculously between his two big annoying periods; inexperienced in early projects (Mrs. Stone) and self-admiring in his later ones (Shampoo, Reds). Somehow Beatty understands that this isn't a place to let his stardom trample everything in sight, and miraculously slips into the picture at the right scale. There is much to find here.I'm intrigued by it's very American obsession with newness, and the subsequent relation to personal rebirth. A town takes form as we watch, and is quickly brought under the thumb of corporate predators. I was puzzled by why a bunch of whores and gamblers even cared about a burning church, but then, perhaps that's a reflection of the current, mistaken belief that only fine, moral people attend church. It's abundantly clear that recent attempts to deconstruct the western all branch off this movie. i.e. Unforgiven's whores and it's sheriff building a new house are mimetic of motifs originating here. And despite it's fans, Deadwood rips this off as McCabe Lite. All the freedom gained in the free-wheeling '60s is brought to bear on an early '70s film; The movie challenges the conventional way the settlement of the West has been portrayed on film. Instead of legendary figures and hagiographic lore, we're offered; a hero that is in no way heroic, a score that avoids heraldic support for anyone, and a revised milieu. Beatty neither gets the girl, or is saved by his smarts in the end. It's a self-effacing movie. Leonard Cohen's muted, weary, sage ballad closes the deal.

In Mcabe and Mrs. Miller she again proves him right. In spite of the mud, grime, cow dung and general crap brown color scheme of the film, Ms. Christie glides through the film with her intelligence, beauty, grace and biting sense of humor bringing the town of Preysbeterian Church to life. While Warren Beatty's John Mcabe has provided a foundation of ambition to build a future on for the budding frontier town, it is Constance Miller for whom he will ultimately sacrifice himself for and in her find a quality of character that can be found only in courage. In that sad and haunting ending, it will be only her beautiful eyes that truly mourn for Beatty's foolish dreamer. I'm just a station on your way to be sure but one worth hurting for. John Mcabe had found something worth living for and in the end, worth dying for. A whore to be sure, Constance Miller still wears her wedding band with never a word devoted to her past and why she is were she is. There is no gold to hold her heart together rather it is held together by secrets, regrets, smarts and for a short time the possibility of something better. Just as she brings the civilized concept of hygiene to an uncivilized frontier town so too she brings a sense of possibility into the always on the hustle life of John Mcabe. Like all great films, Mcabe and Mrs. Miller allows its audience to find its message and what it attempts to leave future generations of viewers. For me, it is a love story and like the doomed Evelyn in Chinatown, Mcabe too would never live to have that something better, to truly say to Constance the things he had said to himself and to the audience. Like Chinatown every new viewing of Mcabe and Mrs. Miller allows the viewer to think maybe this time. Perhaps the true irony of the film is that while the village idiots attempt to save an empty church, their true hero faces down a trio of killers alone. As they atta boy one another for putting out the flames consuming their hallowed house of hypocrisy, the father of their town dies alone in the snow his life slowly being extinguished like the flames in the church. There can be no doubt that his final thoughts like his final words centered on her, his Constance. In the book upon which the film was based Mcabe's final words to Mrs. Miller are tell them that I loved you.The laughter in Mrs. Miller's opiated eyes in her first scene of intimacy with Mcabe and the compassion in her voice in her final night with him will touch me as powerfully the last time I see it as it did the first time. For me they are in the pantheon of greatest moments put to film. My only regret for Ms. Christie's career is that she didn't play the role of Jill Mcbain in Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West. Morricone's theme for Jill would have been as haunting as Cohen's Winterlady was for Constance. Just as Mrs. Miller brought the possibility of a new world to Mcabe, so too Ms. Christie's Jill would have brought a new and civilized world to Leone's mythical west, making the greatest western even greater.

In its evocation of a Pacific Northwest town in 1901 (to clarify although the film was shot outside Vancouver, British Columbia, the town in the film, called Presbyterian Church, is supposed to be situated in either Oregon or, more probably, Washington State, *not* Canada), it does not stint on showing the harshness of everything about this frontier settlement, from the weather to the flophouses, dining halls, saloons and brothels within it. The people are hard-bitten, too, none more so than Mrs. Miller, the worldly doxie who arrives in town to shake things up. (Interestingly, we never see or even hear about Mr. Miller; my guess is that, like Ida, the Shelley Duvall character, Mrs. M is the ungrieving widow of a loveless marriage, forced by economic circumstance to take her fate -- and the local men -- in hand.) This film has been called a masterpiece of realism, yet in some ways that's very misleading. Robert Altman, the director, had the very good fortune to come to prominence just as it became possible for the first time to say or do just about anything in a movie and still get it a commercial release, so long as children were kept out of the theatre (thanks to the new Motion Picture Association code). So the characters could now use language and make references to intimate behavior that would never have been possible if the picture had been released just nine years before, the same year that Sam Peckinpah's Ride the High Country (1962) came out (which was entirely possible, as the source material, the novel McCabe, was published in 1959). However, this use of raw language, which has since invaded even television (The Sopranos, Deadwood), is now very common, so the edge of the film's verbal realism has blunted. Also, it was relatively unusual in the early 1970's to shoot a film entirely on location, as the cast and crew of this film did, but that fact is no longer the case. I think when critics still praise the movie's realism, what they really mean is that the filmmakers have built (quite literally) the world of the film with such depth and detail that it envelopes the viewer and draws her/him into the characters' lives to a degree that few films do.And yet there's a rapturous dreamlike quality to the picture, too. About halfway through the film, it becomes clear that Mrs. Miller is an opium addict, a fact unknown to and unsuspected by McCabe. So the question is when will he find out about her addiction, and what will he do about it? The story's unusual answer is that McCabe, clueless to the end, never does find out -- and his ignorance, or innocence, is somehow beautiful, as is Mrs. Miller's decision to go deeper into her dependency rather than try to rescue McCabe. In a sense, the movie's antique glow and bizarre logic suggest one of Mrs. M's opium fever dreams.Obviously, this is not the film to see if you're suicidally depressed. But for those who appreciate one of the central paradoxes of art -- its ability to create joy while evoking the deepest suffering and even despair -- it will be an experience you'll want to return to again and again.

Oaters traditionally are the realm of strong male characters righting wrong, loving their horses, and ignoring the school marm. Robert Altman, a political and cultural man of the 1960's Left simply says horse feathers. The hero is a corrupt bawdyhouse owner. The school marm makes her living in a crude manner and normal everyday middle-class types don't really exist in the hardscrabble world of capitalism.The town in Vancouver, Canada sits in a mountains and wilderness. The film company built the town. That's real snow there folks and blizzards as our anti-hero Beatty shoots it out with the company men while his best girl Julie Christy hides out in an opium den, her brown eyes realistically glassy.

In fact, the director himself, Robert Altman, labeled it as an anti-western. With its dark imagery and unusual story, it paved the way for modern pieces of art such as Unforgiven, There Will Be Blood and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.Removing all the varnish applied to the Old West, the film gives an honest account of John McCabe, a man who is essentially a gambler. Luck put him in a relatively comfortable position of power and wealth as he arrives in a remote north-western town at the turn of the 20th century. Leaving a strange but discreet past behind him, he's ready to set up a business of his own, and a brothel for the local miners seems like the right idea. Constance Miller comes to offer him partnership. Seeing great potential in the plan, she is willing to run, and work in, a fine whorehouse. McCabe reluctantly accepts, but their business proves to be flourishing - and it surely wouldn't have been as clean and as respectable without Mrs. Miller's intervention. Then, as they prove to be one of the growing community's leading citizens, things start getting out of hand as the inevitable truths of capitalism unravel.The film is mostly about the way the two leads interact with each other. McCabe is smitten by Miller's manners, and from their first encounter it's obvious that he has fallen into a dizzy spell. Some might call it love but it really is the desire for something that you can't fully obtain, something too distant. This Constance Miller who calls herself a madam is a whore, doesn't have much of a heart and doesn't try to hide it, yet she's enterprising, shines with the charm of a real lady, and, deep down, she's a sweet person. Their relationship is awkward and not based on love, but there is an indescribable feeling to it.Julie Christie embodies her role magnificently (Al Pacino called her the most poetic of all actresses, watching this you can understand why). Warren Beatty is very convincing as the cigar-smoking John McCabe, a pathetically flawed man, not a hero, but a man you can identify with, for his weaknesses as well as for his strengths. The photography of wet, muddy landscape and Leonard Cohen's music confirm the melancholy mood. The pace is cautious and succeeds in revealing only as much as necessary, yet isn't slow and keeps the story going, as the details are paid attention to. The directing is perfect for the film - the characters and their conflicts, the dialogue, the humor all perfect. Everything fits, what else can I say? This is, in my book, one of the most understated masterpieces in the history of American cinema. It is strange and peculiar, and not for everyone to like and understand. But McCabe & Mrs. Miller is a unique and powerful film - it accomplishes everything it sets out to do.

McCabe & Mrs. Miller totally breaks away from that. Warren Beatty plays John McCabe, who sets up a brothel in a small town in the Pacific Northwest around the turn of the century. His business gets a lot of seedy customers at first, but then Constance Miller (Julie Christie) gets him to fix the place up. After a mining company tries to buy him out at rock bottom price, he refuses, and so they send some killers after him.Why this movie is so great is not just because it avoids the conventional western mold; it also shows the rise of big business, and how it often involved some slimy methods. It almost doesn't suffice to call McCabe & Mrs. Miller a western; it's more surreal and gritty than we would expect.Robert Altman made a masterpiece in the true sense of the word. In my opinion, this movie deserved Best Picture for 1971. That sure was a great year for movies (Death in Venice, A Clockwork Orange, Carnal Knowledge, Shaft, Willard, Klute, Play Misty for Me, Dirty Harry, Sunday Bloody Sunday, Bananas, The Devils, Cold Turkey and Walkabout).

I did not hate it. I did not love it except for the end. Some people say Altman is an acquired taste. After seeing this and the average Short Cuts, I fear I know what side of the tracks I'm on.There was definitely stuff to like. Warren Beatty and Julie Christie were both very good as the title characters especially Julie Christie. It was well written. Although a low body count, the movie did something very revolutionary at the time by making the deaths very poignant and meaningful instead of being a mindless kill fest of a Western. By far the best feature is the ending, it is well thought out, emotionally builds tension, and undeniably brilliant. It definitely goes off on the right note. Also a very good soundtrack by Leonard Cohen.A lot of the techniques Altman used were very annoying. There was basically no lighting. I can honestly say that about 30 percent of this movie I could not see what was going on. Altman is known for and especially in M*A*S*H for putting dialog over other dialog and then for some odd reason going to the unimportant person's dialog. I know he is trying to be realistic but it is distracting ,completly arbitrary and a waste of time. It has a bunch of pointless scenes. Although some very good cinematography on some outside scenes, most of the inside scenes give off an unnatural yellowish orange color that is honestly not very good on the eyes. My biggest complaint is the title characters relationship. The book is called McCabe and they should have named the movie the same. Julie Christie was very under used. I wanted more of her. I thought their relationship was underdeveloped. There were parts in her character I wanted to go into with more depth i.e. her opium addiction but not to a veil. After the breathtaking ending, you see an image of her and you wish there was more of her. Maybe it did not go off on the right foot.

I'm somewhat amused by those that seem to think this version of the Old West is somehow the most real. They believe that the west was a place that was dark, rainy, and muddy all the time. One can't deny the influence Altman's film has had on westerns since. So many have shot their westerns to mimic this supposed reality. The comparisons typically go old westerns didn't have it right but Altman does. His is the most authentic picture of life in the Old West. Really? So life in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, California, etc. matched that of rainy Vancouver? This is ridiculous. Here's what's real this movie takes place in the pacific northwest and is shot in Canada. To say Altman is fictionally portraying a small previously unexplored part of Old West history is fine. But to take it a step further and say this is representative of the Old West as a whole or even a majority is blatantly false. Furthermore, to use this as a tool to degrade older western movies, which actually did take place and were filmed in proper western US locations, is dishonest. Sorry but this sort of thing has always bugged me. I'm not a big fan of the visual of the Canadian westerns even though I have enjoyed quite a few of them as films. It's an artistic choice for these filmmakers to choose to shoot there because the weather is depressing and the stories usually follow suit. It's also a business choice because it has been so much cheaper to film there for decades. But let's not say it's because of historical accuracy when it isn't.Anyway, as to this film's merits. I won't bother to cover ground others have covered. It's an enjoyable movie, artistically speaking, though not much fun and you're left at the end with a what was the point type of feeling. It's definitely not a strong narrative. The story is paper thin. If you're coming to this hoping to see some of what you expect from the two stars, you'll probably be disappointed. Warren Beatty is not his usual sexy, funny, charming self. Hidden away behind a beard and spending about half the movie mumbling like Popeye, none of the personality Beatty exhibited in most of his more famous films comes through. Julie Christie is a great beauty but here she's deliberately uglied up so as to add to the film's perceived authenticity.It's a revisionist western and a good one.

I was hiking in the mountains in West Vancouver circa 1970. I came across a little mining town, with horses, and people running about, and small buildings made of unpainted lumber. There was some animal being roasted whole over a fire. It was off in the distance, down a steep cliff so I could not get close to find out why these people were doing this reenactment. I had never heard of any group that lived in the mountains as people lived a century before. I wondered how they could possibly earn a living on such barren rock.When I went to see the movie is the 70s, the village seemed familiar, though something does not quite add up. I was way far from any road or civilisation. Surely the movie set could not have been. Altman himself said it was near luxury homes. So maybe I did experience an Altman Brigadoon.The village is so authentic. I could just feel the draftiness, the mud, the damp, the brooding cloudy days, the driving rain, the sleet, the snow. The weather is the primary fact of life. It was not a set, but a real collection of mining village buildings. The village is a character in the movie, one that always so interesting to look at. You cannot escape feeling just how uncomfortable and uncouth life was in such a place. I don't think any other movie has such an intense sense of place.The characters are flawed, but I loved them all the more. I have seen the movie three times and each time I teared up when McCabe died. There is big cast including Keith Caradine as a folksy, lovable cowboy, John Schuck (Painless Waldowski the dentist in Mash), Shelley Duvall as the widow forced into prostitution, René Auberjonois. There are a Fellinesque roster of chippers (hookers). It was so odd watching prostitutes who would be utterly shunned today teasing their miner clients with come hither gestures.The villains are exceedingly menacing. They are polite, indirect, and procrastinate their assassinations. It quite different from any other western you will ever see.The movie is very unsentimental, and completely without moralising. You realise after the movie is over you actually watched women being bought and sold, and you did not bat an eye. The movie just sucks you in with its strong sense of reality. There is just nothing remotely like this movie. It probably should not even be called a movie. It is like watching a human ant farm, where you get to look at the antics of hundreds of humans and how they interact. It very much like I imagine time travel would be, where you could slip into a real mining village over a century ago and just wander about looking at what interested you.About the only thing that threw me was the Leonard Cohen sound track. Over the years since he made the soundtrack, Leonard's voice has dropped an octave or two. It sounds odd hearing him so shrill.

This time, he's determined the bastards won't take him down. He ventures through the mud to the one area tavern, flings a rag on the table and extracts a pack of cards, to carry on. His idea is to put together a whorehouse with a bathhouse out back, and thus prosper. By the end, a showdown will occur as an upshot. Death is quite ultimate in this western, because the movie is about life. Most Westerns are about shooting and being shot, which means they're not about life and death in any way. We consume a time in the life of an insignificant frontier town, which develops before us out of crude lumber and canvas tents. We become acquainted with the town in practice, as Altman is at his best by far when making movies that appear to snoop on commotion that would've been going on anyway.That's how M*A*S*H and California Split work, where a great deal of time isn't squandered familiarizing characters and their relationships, since the characters are already everything. In most movies, an actor appears and has no distinctiveness until another characters refers to him. In McCabe & Mrs. Miller, lensed by Vilmos Zsigmond as inexorably dreary and oppressive, all sepia and sopping in flagrant stench, Altman employs his discreetly inconspicuous camera, an idiosyncratic everyday manner of dialogue and the flowing physicality of his cast to show us people who are characters from the instant we notice them. We have the feeling that when they leave the screen they're still contemplating, droning, grazing, shaving and nodding to one another.McCabe and Mrs. Miller are a natural part of this society. We're conscious, naturally, that they're actually Warren Beatty and Julie Christie, but they're there in conjunction with everyone else in town, and it simply befalls the movie to be about their lives. Since the movie is about a phase in the lives of various people and not about a sequence of events, McCabe and Mrs. Miller transform throughout the pattern of the narrative. Mrs. Miller is a resilient Cockney madam who persuades McCabe that he needs a capable boss for his bordello How would he ever know enough about handling women? He begrudgingly concurs, and she lives up to her guarantee, and they're well en route to making enough money for her to leave this hole of a mining town and back to where she deems a woman of her caliber belongs.The open air is constantly there, and people are constantly coming in and out of it and shaking the rain from their hats, and we see the trees thrashing in the wind through the windows. But it's a damp fall and then a frosty winter, so people of course gather together in saloons and grocery stores and whorehouses, and the weather compels a feeling of community. Then the baddies roll to town The smooth, Scottish-accented Butler and his two subordinates. One of them is slack-jawed and callous, the other a jumpy blonde kid. On the suspension bridge, he shoots a bony, carefree country boy with a welcoming smile, and it's one of the most moving and forceful deaths there's ever been in a western.The ultimate pursuit for McCabe is set in virtually abandoned streets, as the church is burning down and everybody's out struggling to salvage it. The church burns throughout an ethereal, overcast daylight snowstorm. Fire and ice. McCabe & Mrs. Miller is like no other western ever made, a chilly, minute portrait of a hamlet hacked together from damp kindling and basic bodily luxuries completely insufficient as padding against the wild. Not just the wilderness, but also the brute in people that will reduce the township's modest house of worship to ashes, billows uniting around Mrs. Miller in assonance with the final gusts of frosty breath as McCabe garners the rewards of his foolishness and self-indulgence.The entire film is encapsulated around this frustrating, impressionistic mast of things lost and irretrievable in time. Altman's technique is ideal for a film about not entirely being able to grasp everything, not finding the big picture, not distinguishing the whole story, not identifying with much of any of it with any logical element of one's personal perception. See it in the way McCabe is invariably a pace behind what the cosmos has coming up for him He's too dim for Constance, too thick to see that his refusal to sell his assets has condemned him. His pains to salvage his circumstances are feeble. Through it all is a feeling that in this space and generation, there was a possibility of harmony, albeit it was wasted, that misspending of it is the basic story and misfortune of humanity. Each bitter arrangement, each glum scene, each supporting character, bids a piece to fulfill the pivotal metaphor.

Mrs. Miller, an experienced madam, soon approaches him with an offer of partnership, which he grudgingly accepts. Their business prospers but that prosperity attracts the sort of buyers who won't take no for an answer.The plot's a bit thin so much of the film's forward momentum is dependant upon the actors. Warren Beatty shows himself capable in the lead role but he's outshone by Julie Christie, who was rewarded with an Oscar nomination for her standout performance. The rest of the cast bears the stamp of authenticity, which is also a credit to the wardrobe & makeup departments.Robert Altman's direction is expertly handled and Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography effectively captures the bleak feel of the location. Unfortunately, the film's climactic scene features some 'snow' added in post-production that is distractingly substandard. The sound is also less than spectacular, though that's partly by design. As for the soundtrack, Leonard Cohen's songs prove to be ideally suited to the film.Ultimately, McCabe & Mrs. Miller is an engrossing Western that doesn't rely on convention. The languid pacing and somber tone won't appeal to everyone but, to me, they added a grandeur to the proceedings that would have been spoiled by shoot-'em-up heroics.

Had I not read Roger Ebert's review before hand then I might not have enjoyed this one as much as I did. In his review, Ebert calls the film a poem--an elegy for the dead and I think that's a good way to describe the film. The visual look is very interesting and at the start of the film I thought I was seeing a very bad transfer but it really fits the deadness of the town very well. I loved how Altman shot everything in dark rooms only lit by small lanterns. This certainly sets the mood and atmosphere. I also loved the Leonard Cohen songs, which, again, perfectly sets the mood. This is really unlike any other western that I've seen and that's probably why it took me several minutes to get into the movie.

Definite Spoilers","Date":"21 December 2000","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Western","Review":"  The following discloses significant plot points.McCabe & Mrs. Miller represents an important reversal of the classic western. Instead of using `open spaces' as a means of engaging the audience, McCabe and Mrs. Miller explores deeper issues atypical to many of the traditional westerns. McCabe & Mrs. Miller is the ultimate anti-western. It abandons the typical genre treatment of the role of women on the frontier. At one point in the movie, in a bar, miners murmur over McCabe's revolver, pointing out an anti-genre fact, that no one is armed. And again, in possibly the film's most beautiful scene, a cross is raised and placed atop the steeple by the solitary churchman, an interesting comment on how the town will distance itself religiously and find solace in its `unholy' elements. At the center of Altman's social commentary is a story about a loner hero, his unavailable business partner and themes about the modernisation of the `uncivilized' West. The chief protagonist is Altman's western hero a stylish entrepreneur named John McCabe. In the opening credits he arrives upon the film's western town not a dry, dusty outpost like the Tombstone in my Darling Clementine but an area of clustered canvas tents and opium dens. It's a mining camp called Presbyterian Church, with the actual unfinished steeple in the background. Right after he emerges from the woods, it is quite evident that what McCabe is looking for is a place to make money. The town will expand and develop, and McCabe will be the principal agent of its changes. Because of his demeanor and appearance, it is difficult for the audience to decide how to react to McCabe. McCabe represents the atypical western hero. In one scene three gunmen confront him in a tavern. When he is accused of killing a friend of one of the gunmen, he relinquishes any credit for the killing and quickly leaves. McCabe realistically lets himself be humiliated before the town rather than be destroyed by forces he is afraid of. By the end of the movie he will be opposed by a host of individuals representing civilization. Even the character of Mrs. Miller exhibits an independent and unsupportive relationship outside of their business partnership. In fact, the character of Mrs. Miller is a good example of the film's anti-genre characterisation or women. At one point in the film she asks McCabe to be his business partner. Her long business proposition (`What do you do when one girl fancies another?') is fascinating because it discloses a part of frontier life that is totally bypassed by the Western genre. As a result, Altman uses her speech as another device for going against the Western genre. McCabe & Ms. Miller repeatedly suggests that the coming of civilization is little but a destructive device. When three evil gunmen are shown moving on Presbyterian Church their figures are photographed against the sun, mocking genre conventions that they may represent good. They bring only destruction to the frontier. The three recall the genre's clans of villains. Here, they are rendered as technological imperialists imposing themselves on the frontier of Presbyterian Church.  At one point in the movie one of the gunmen (a boy) confronts a tall, gawky cowboy on a bridge. When the gunman taunts the cowboy into reaching for a pistol, the cowboy admits he doesn't know how to use it. As the cowboy touches the weapon, the boy blasts him off the bridge. Indeed, the gunmen talk and behave less like western badmen and more like Nazi henchmen. In the film's climax there is a shootout between McCabe and the gunmen. The anti-genre point is that the western community is ready to be civilized but has no use for McCabe. He will fight and die alone, the town's citizens denying his peril. Success has only endangered McCabe and the community he created won't help him. Even Mrs. Miller will not support him. These final scenes coincide with the town finding newfound social cooperation as they band together to save a church from being burned down. They take great measures to save the church even as the individual responsible for the town's success dies in the snow only a few hundred yards away. As a result, McCabe's anti-hero dies under the ignoring eyes of the townspeople whose lives he has transformed. In the film's final scene Mrs. Miller fades away in an opium den in the town's Chinese quarter. Like McCabe, she is as far away from the townspeople's minds and chooses oblivion from the limitations of opium. McCabe & Mrs. Miller. Death and Oblivion.

But it is more than just a hit, it is a masterpiece. I can understand why people mayn't quite adjust to the sombre tone and the slow pacing, but I don't consider either of these flaws in any way. McCabe and Mrs Miller, although it does have a fine story, great direction, a very good script and well realised characters, it is more a mood piece than anything else, and the mood is really quite haunting. And I think the pacing is deliberate and suits the tone of the film wonderfully. The film looks stunning, with great cinematography and production values and the Leonard Cohen soundtrack compliments the film perfectly.

There is the usual group of people forming a loosely structured community, and there are reality intrusions and unanticipated events. But the film has a plot too. It generates not just a sense of familiarity but tension as well. It leads somewhere and the outcome, which is a matter of life and death, is problematic.Warren Beatty rides into a rough-hewn town in the Pacific Northwest. The buildings are all made of raw planks of shaved wood. The rooms are small, drafty and crowded with sweaty people in gargantuan fur robes.Beatty sets up a cat house. He's soon joined by Julie Christie, who convinces him that he does not know how to manage a whore house or anything else -- he can't subtract nine from twenty-three in his head -- whereas she, with all her experience, and with a share of the profits, can turn the entrepreneurial adventure into a success. She does so.Beatty falls for Christie over time, but she's largely indifferent to him. Also she's into doing opium with the local Chinese population during her quiet time. It's a very PC movie. (Beatty Many Chinks around here?) Little does he know that trouble lies just around the corner. He doesn't know because the character, unlike Beatty, hasn't read the script and doesn't realize that a Western that is not an outright comedy requires a climactic showdown. Two agents from a mining company show up and want to buy him out. They offer a fair price but Beatty is a bit of a fool and turns them down flat. Christie warns him that the company doesn't take no for an answer and that he's endangering his life, but Beatty, the big know-it-all who can't add or subtract, rejects a second, higher offer from the two agents. The agents are both puzzled and disappointed. They agree to turn the affair over to Jake. Then they leave town.Jake is seven feet tall. He rides into town in a silver fur coat the size of a circus tent, carrying a ten-foot-long big-barreled rifle, accompanied by two ominous gun-toting hoods of lesser proportions.At last Beatty awakens to the fact that these are deeper waters than he'd thought. But he's not Gary Cooper and this is not High Noon. Beatty is not only terrified at the prospect of death. He does everything he can to sell out.First, full of bravado, he visits Jake Butler in the saloon. While other townsfolk look on, Jake immediately takes control of the situation. Beatty offers him a cigar but Jake says, Have one of mine. And when Beatty suggests they retire to a remote table to talk business, Jake stops him with, No, this is fine. Beatty then offers, with much hemming and hawing, to sell his property at a lower price than the two agents first offered. But I don't make deals, says Jake with a big firm grin.Next, Beatty goes to the nearest port town in Washington state and looks up the two agents, hoping to sell out to THEM, but they've already gone.Beatty consults a lawyer -- the next senator from the state of Washington -- who tells him he has nothing to worry about; they'll take the matter to court and Beatty will be a hero to the common man. Talk about Job's comforters! Beatty may be shot and killed the very next day, so the last thing on his mind is becoming a beacon of hope for the man on the street.You can tell this is an Altman film from the overlapping dialog and the way disparate individuals keep bumping into one another and trading wisecracks. Most of those wisecracks were hoary with age when I heard them in high school. Beatty You keep talking about 'we.' Who's this 'we'? You have a turd in your pocket? And there is humor too, more set up than in many of Altman's other films. Christie excoriates Beatty for not having bathed. Beatty gets drunk, sitting in a chair and trying unsuccessfully to close his pocket watch, shabby, mumbling, I don't give a s***. I ain't takin' no g** damn bath. But he does finally bathe and tries to visit Christie with a handful of flowers. The door to her room is locked. Open this door, he demands. No. Well if you think I'm going to talk to you through a locked door (he lurches against it and it doesn't budge).... that's all right with me. The shoot out is full of suspense and far more believable than that in High Noon. The whole structure of the movie makes more sense. Beatty has no sense of honor. His manhood has nothing to do with it. Of the people he manages to put a bullet into (one each), he shoots two of them in the back before they know he's there. And Christie merely droops with resignation and retreats to the Chinese opium den.The movie isn't as taut as it might be, or as inexorably logical. (What Altman film is?) The deep affection between Beatty and Christie pops up out of nowhere like a jack in the box. The sound track is sometimes muddied by extraneous conversations. The production designer and set dresser should get a medal for that drafty new wooden town. It's a Northwest Coast climate. When it's not raining it's snowy or, at best, cloudy. Seattle weather forecasts sometimes predict sun breaks, meaning that the cloud cover may have holes in it and if you're lucky you might get a glimpse of the sun. The town reeks of damp sawdust. And like the surrounding forests of pine and fir, it's laden with wet heavy snow. Give a medal to wardrobe too. Where did they come up with that cartoon cowboy hat that Keith Carradine wears?

The film casts a powerful spell unlike any other movie. NASHVILLE and THREE WOMEN may be closer to my heart, but MCCABE is one of a kind.

I heard a lot about this prior to watching it through cinephile sites and insights from other famous directors about it, and I thought for sure that I would love it. I don't really know what to say, honestly. It's one of the slowest westerns ever made. Not too much happens, and most of the dialogue is completely garbled and unintelligible due to what I think was a terrible job in the sound department, but upon research, I think that it might have been on purpose. Cinematography is quite beautiful for it's time, of course thanks to the great Vilmos Zsigmond. I appreciate what it did for the western genre, by making McCabe all talk and no action. The final shootout proves to us that he is sort of a coward. In the end, he's just a hustler, looking for love and a place to belong, but realizing nearly all of it comes at a price. After reading Roger Ebert's review of the film, I realized that the story is more or less about loneliness. McCabe and Mrs. Miller are essentially empty people, hiding under fake identities of grandeur. But they've been playing the game for so long, that even when they try to act like a couple, it fails miserably. The end of the film is extremely well done, with the close up of McCabe freezing to death in the snow, as the camera blurs out, and cutting back to Mrs. Miller getting high in the opium den. Poignant, beautiful, and perhaps indicative of the entire film itself. I don't know if I will ever watch the film again, it's quite tough to sit through, but as a fan of Altman, this is a film worth telling people that you've watched.

It's a wonder that a studio exec does just burn a script if it has even a trace of the stench of the genre corpse. There have been a few post McCabe films which offer something to modern audiences like cult hit Dead Man, Sujaki Western Django, AoJJ(The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford), Malicks The New World, PTA's TWBB, Coen's NCFOM, Van Sants Gerry, parts of KB & KB2,The Quick & the Dead and the amazing The Proposition.

The enterprise flourishes under the professional management of a beautiful, embittered English madam, but finally attracts the attention of a polite but ruthless corporate tycoon named, not without irony, Sears.Robert Altman's richly textured period piece isn't quite the anti-western it wants to be. By showing all the mud and filth of the wild frontier he succeeds in de-glamorizing the traditional silver screen image of the Old West, but without in any way compromising the mythical aura around it. In true tall-tale fashion the squalor and raw vulgarity of the setting itself is romanticized, in a suitably grubby 1971 sort of way, as a rough and tumble backwoods Utopia ripe for exploitation (i.e. the advent of commerce), following the evolution of frontier civilization from the miners to the gamblers to, finally, the arrival of big business.The anti-establishment message is more a by-product of the 1960s than the 1860s, but the film still sets an effective mood, thanks in part to Altman's skill with improvisation, combined with Vilmos Zsigmond's atmospheric wide-lens photography and an evocative song score by Leonard Cohen. The director liked to use incidental gestures and offhand action to tell his story, and the approach holds up well enough until the final scenes, when the film becomes (ironically) more disjointed as its plot becomes more focused. The tragic ending, with the hero shot dead in the snow and the heroine (salty English madam Julie Christie) lost in an opium fog, is a typical example of early '70s iconoclasm.

His business partner in this venture is a madam named Constance Miller (Julie Christie). Unfortunately, a much more powerful business tries to muscle its way into this now thriving territory. McCabe is too content with business as is to accept their offers, which only serves to get him into trouble.McCabe & Mrs. Miller is a fine example of putting a fresh spin on the mythology of the Old West. It does indeed work as a precursor to the later TV series 'Deadwood'. Widescreen cinematography, by Vilmos Zsigmond, and production design, by Leon Ericksen, are first rate. The location shooting in wintry British Columbia, Canada, is another appreciable element. The theme of progress and of big business making life miserable for the independent operators is one that's still quite relevant today. The two main characters are extremely engaging, with Christie a delight in an Oscar nominated performance. Songs by Leonard Cohen are utilized throughout.Altman works with another of his superb ensemble supporting casts Rene Auberjonois, William Devane (who has just one scene, but makes it count), John Schuck, Bert Remsen, Shelley Duvall, Keith Carradine, Michael Murphy, and Hugh Millais. Familiar faces in smaller roles include Janet Wright, Wayne Robson, Jack Riley, Wayne Grace, and Don Francks.The finale is incredibly tense and plays out without too much dialogue.

And like Welles' great work, Altman's was revolutionary in style, not only visually and particularly audibly, but with a new type of realism that he had only begun developing in M.A.S.H.  The characters are so individual, so 3-dimensional, and the sense of place so pervasive, that it becomes an immersion into a frontier life that never strikes a false note.  (Well, Carradine's cowpoke is a little too goofy, perhaps.) The narrative is compelling and utterly believable, the tension quite naturally evolves, and the ending an existential masterpiece comparable to Taxi Driver or Wages of Fear/Sorcerer.The music is perfection itself.  Not only the haunting Leonard Cohen musical commentary, but the addition on the soundtrack of only a fiddler and flute player, both of whom are characters in the film.  The Cohen music made it seem like a hippified western in 1971, but like the entire film, has stood the test of time and now seems classic.One last comment about Warren Beatty.  His performance is beautifully nuanced, an anti-hero who is at the same time brave and romantic in an uneducated, simple way.  His soliloquy toward the end, as he prepares to go out and face the killers, is positively Shakespearean.

But the setting; it could have been set in the present.  It could have been futuristic, it could have been set in any era.  I guess the same could be said about most westerns, but 'High Noon' stands out as a morality play that just happens to be set in the Old West.All of the above could be said about 'McCabe' except for one thing  in the end, McCabe does not prevail.  He is hunted down by the hired killers and, although they get theirs, he gets his as well.  Where 'High Noon' leaves the viewer feeling satisfied, 'McCabe' leaves us in an oddly uncomfortable mood.  Just what is wrong with people, anyhow?  Even the preacher turns on him,  threatening to shoot him, sending him out of sanctuary and forcing him to leave his rifle, his only chance at survival, in the church.  Neither film is a strong endorsement of mankind, but while 'High Noon' leaves us with some hope, 'McCabe' drives the point right through our hearts  when the chips are down, you can't count on anyone but yourself.

What's most remarkable about it, of course, is the extraordinary sense of place. It's hard to think of another film that captures the feel of a period setting so vividly and authentically the main character of the film really is the town of Presbyterian Church itself. Altman himself admits that the story's a complete cliché, but as it often is with this director, that very fact allows him to explore a unique, elliptical means of storytelling, and to trust the audience to be able to fill in the blanks on their own. So a goofy comic premise (with a sinister Western twist) becomes a beautiful, quietly haunting portrait of a down-on-its-luck town in a down-on-its-luck time. Warren Beatty's McCabe is an affable but fundamentally incompetent tinhorn with a 'big rep' he doesn't deserve, while Julie Christie's Mrs. Miller is the true entrepreneur--a blunt, impatient woman whose ideas are so big even her gender, class, and occupation can't conspire to contain them. These two aren't particularly well-defined characters on their own, but when they play off each other they come briefly into sharp relief, and the effect is engaging and strangely moving. The ensemble cast, with a couple exceptions, is perhaps less recognizable than Altman's would be in later projects, but that contributes to the realism of the project. In the end, the film is slight, perhaps--no towering comedy/drama/satire like the director's masterpieces 'Nashville' and 'Short Cuts'--but that is part of its charm, and we are surprised at how its sadness lingers with us, long after the credits have rolled. 9 out of 10.

This is nothing like a typical western though it could be described as Mash, part 2, even if on the surface there isn't any resemblance. Look underneath, watch them back to back, and you shall find. These things are harder to describe in words, hence the reason for cinema. Altman refuses to be obvious here or turn things towards audience conditioning. The awesome, winter-gothic cinematography alone would warrant multiple viewings. The sound is not that clear and was responsible for the movie flopping at the box office, but it forces you to pay attention, and to tell you the truth it's part of the movie's charm and I can understand why Altman refused to have it re-edited. People like to sit back and vegetate to a movie; can't do it here. You have to LEARN to watch a movie like this, the same way you LEARN to appreciate Jimi Hendrix, Jazz, Painting or Stravinsky. One level leads to the next and is its own reward. It takes some concentration and commitment, but it's not difficult and more than worth your effort, something you won't realize until you're there and won't try if you're prejudiced at the outset. Then, when you do that, you will refuse to watch too many movies that don't meet your standards, you will demand great movies like this, and if enough people do what you did, the business weasels will have to satisfy the new DECONDITIONED demand (though they certainly will not like it and will quickly proceed to RECONDITION you as soon as possible), REVOLUTION will happen and the world will change! Seriously, and no need to turn commie or anything. How do you think all the great movies of the '70s came to be made, voodoo? Anyway, 1971 was the year McCabe was made, and things were a little different than now. Warren Beatty's performance (not too far from his real life persona)as a small town entrepreneur and part-time pimp, is his best and so is Julie Christie's (as the Madame/original-feminist with more business sense than Beatty). Altman's McCabe should have a bigger audience and should be regarded as vastly superior to the ridiculously overrated Wild Bunch and the overrated landmark Chinatown, which is a film-noir version of McCabe with some incest thrown in.

Soon, a 'classy' working girl, Mrs. Miller (Julie Christie) approaches him with a plan to increase profits by improving the house's image--with prettier girls, required baths by everyone and the like. It is successful but other folks want a piece of the action.I am a retired history teacher, so I am very critical of many Hollywood films because they play fast and loose with the facts. So, in this sense, I am happy to see a film like McCabe & Mrs. Miller because it presents a stark contrast to the squeaky clean and silly image we used to get in westerns. Singing cowboys wearing clean designer outfits were the norm in the 1930s-50s and while Roy Rogers and Gene Autry films were enjoyable, they were pure fiction. Here in McCabe & Mrs. Miller, however, things are DIRTY---bleak, dismal and brown. And, folks are scraggly-haired, filthy and consort with whores...LOTS and LOTS of whores. This is much more realistic but it also presents two major problems. First, this ultra-realism of the 1970s paints an inaccurate picture in another way because EVERYONE is filthy and nasty in this film...EVERYONE. Second, even if it is more realistic in some ways, who wants to see such a depressing and nasty film?! While I know many reviewers love this one, I also wonder how many more wouldn't see a film like this in the first place or would just turn it off after a few minutes? With language I cannot repeat on IMDb due to their standards for reviews (so many things they say in the film are simply not allowed to be repeated here), I am sure many folks wouldn't sit still for the picture--and I am not talking about prudes but the average person who doesn't want to hear burping, cursing and a story all about prostitutes, opium addicts and pimps.Apart from the nastiness of the plot and characters, I have another issue with the film and it's technical. While the film is by a very well respected director, it's odd that the film looks and sounds so darn ugly. The sound is muddy and the cinematography is much the same. It just looks crudely made and watching it with captions is an almost must--as otherwise, some of the sound is a bit hard to understand.Overall, I found this film to be quite innovative and unrelentingly unpleasant.

The tale of a savior for everyone lays as a backdrop for the 1971 film. Warren Beatty and Julie Christie join forces to bring a sense of civilization to the town of Presbyterian Church, which has little civilization and no church. A heavy western dealing with themes of isolation and redeemers, McCabe and Mrs. Miller came off a touch thematically weighed down.Upon his arrival to the town of Presbyterian Church, gambler John McCabe (Warren Beatty) quickly learns that the town of God is nearly God-less, as the church remains under construction. McCabe then designates himself to be the town's savior, the first nod to this enduring theme. He wants to bring his brand of civility to a township that, is, well, lacking. Deciding to build a brothel, McCabe is soon joined in his exploits by Mrs. Miller, a shrewd business-minded woman who seems to believe that she acts as a savior to the girls she employs. Soon, as their mutual business thrives, so do budding feelings between the entrepreneurs. Competing moral compasses keep McCabe and Mrs. Miller apart, as each walk among the desolate winter scene McCabe traverses reminds the viewer that the only certainty in life is solitude; we enter, and leave this world, alone. Soon, a battle erupts as the business is challenged by corporate interests who have invaded the town. The choice McCabe makes was perhaps the only one he could live with, but it holds desperate consequences for everyone else involved. The forever in solitude, John McCabe was played well by Warren Beatty who was able to execute the competing dualities of McCabe's character, who both wanted to be alone, but also wanted to be loved and needed. Julie Christie plays Mrs. Miller well also as the gruff, shrewd business woman, yet angel to the girls she employed. Personally, I get pulled into a movie's lighting. If the lighting is not right for the mood, the story is not being told properly. The lighting in McCabe and Mrs. Miller was overly dark, which fit the mood well, but was not contrasted enough with brightening during the lighter parts of the film. Another compelling aspect of the film was the cinematography. Shots of trees and mountains slated against the unfruitful harsh winter that was being endured were a true treat to the viewer. The shots were also pivotal to illustrate the deeper themes of the film. There's not much that photographs lonelier than a bare tree in the middle of winter. The audience learns that McCabe is like this tree, alone, yet seeking the cover of its familiarity. The audience eventually starts rooting for McCabe, in hopes that someday find his leaves.All-in-all, I applaud Robert Altman for providing audiences with such a deep film, and bringing such allegory and theme to the western genre. That being said, it was a little symbolism heavy. The Jesus-like moment in this film was not executed as well as the one in say, Raging Bull (1980), nor was it necessary to prove that theme to the audience. If only the director had more faith in his audience to reach the conclusions he was intending, rather than weighing down the film with so much symbolism, McCabe and Mrs. Miller could have risen to Classic status outside of the western genre. We will never know what could have happen, and even though I found the thematic elements over the top, I would recommend this film to any fans of great westerns, or Warren Beatty.

The movie takes its time, but I found the film incredibly engaging because of the performances of Warren Beatty and Julie Christie. I loved the scenery shots of the film, and it really made the Pacific Northwest look beautiful. Another thing that stood out to me is the soundtrack made by the great Leonard Cohen, a gifted songwriter. His songs worked well with the film and it breathed more life into this western.Robert Altman's film is about a businessman named John McCabe who builds a whorehouse in a remote Western town. Soon after his new tavern is built, Mrs. Miller arrives and she offers herself as a business partner to McCabe's booming business. Soon after that, several businessmen arrives asking to buy McCabe's business, but his answer may bring consequences to himself, Mrs. Miller, and the whole town.Also prevalent in 70's movies are films that don't rely on big casts. This film is an example of that statement. The only two big name stars are Beatty and Andrews. They both are excellent, and both share on screen compatibility. I love how the film doesn't really push a romance between the two characters. There is no doubt a sense of affection and perhaps a tough love for each other, but no falling in love kind of thing. At least it wasn't obvious.Overall, McCabe and Mrs. Miller is a very impressive film. The film takes its time to tell the story and sometimes that is a cause of frustration. But I fell deeply in love with the characterization and I wanted to see what happens to both main characters. The tone is often gritty and dark, which I enjoyed.

For a film which deals with brothels, puritans might raise objection to a film about a small American town where people seem to be more interested in god, wine and brothels. For the end result, Altman chose to depict that the overconfidence is not at all good. There are times when even circumstances compel a macho man to collapse.

Not a great fan of Mr. Beatty (Is Carly Simon's famous song about him? I think so), he is great in this role - showing that bluster and chutzpa can get you somewhere - although in the end of course it gets him killed.Julie Christie is beautiful, fiery, and mysterious as Mrs Miller. An opium addict, she tries to escape her quite sordid world through drugs ( sound familiar?) as she prods and cajoles McCabe to be what he pretends to be. One of my favorite scenes is when she is challenging him to think big - you always think small. This is interesting as he always talks big, but in fact has a very limited vision of what can be.I love to see growth (both good an bad) in characters. Check out the progression of evil in Walter White in Breaking Bad. McCabe, although he is 90% bluff (he is a gambler) does rise to the occasion when threatened by the gunslingers at the end. It is great to see him step up when the time came - even thought the end is tragic and very poignant.But the best part of the movie for me is the ambiance and setting and the cinematography. The bleak scenery and town provide a perfect backdrop for what I believe life was like in the early days of Western expansion. Mud, cold, unwashed people, ugly women, uglier men - this is what I imagine life was like in the Old West. Loving snow scenes, the weather portrayed in the movie is excellent, especially the heavy snow at the end. The way the film was shot with the haunting Leonard Cohen music gives this film an atmosphere of dark intrigue.BTW Leonard Cohen is still at it - check him out on one of the tracks in Sons of Anarchy (Come Healing).Finally there is the mystery. Is Warren Beatty actually John McCabe - the gunslinger who killed Bill Roundtree? Or is that part of the disguise he is willing to assume to gain respect?

Not many films so audaciously drop us into a location and made us fend for ourselves. McCabe & Mrs. Miller is a strange and evocative film, a film that somehow manages to feel abstract and almost experimental in it's approach but is brought to life by some extraordinary miracles of acting and an engrossing narrative. Warren Beatty is wonderful as McCabe, arousing great sympathy for a deeply flawed and pained character, and watching him grunt and tumble around town is one of the films greatest pleasures. We put aside any notion that Beatty or Julie Christie are stars, and just sit back and watch them act the hell out of it. The cinematography and sound are particularly striking - purposefully flashed negatives create the illusion we are watching the film unfold beneath layers of glass, and the muffled sound track and lonely guitar fades in and out during long takes. Sometimes we have to strain to hear the commotion. At first the style is disarming - then once we settle into it, we're there, and it almost feels like we're watching a movie of a movie. Watching this last night made me sad for Robert Altman's passing, though it happened years ago his films have always been such great companions for me. He was truly one of the greatest filmmakers to ever blaze through, and this film is the charred evidence.

It becomes immediately apparent that the director has stock repertory of actors as actors such as Rene Auberjonois, Michael Murphy, John Schuck appeared in both.Another thing noticeable immediately is the cinematography and the photography, the great Vilmos Zsigmond adds vibrant colour and mood to the bleak landscape of the Pacific north west.Warren Beatty gives a charismatic performance as someone who is not as bright as he thinks he is who opens a brothel in this rough frontier town. Success comes in the form of Mrs Miller played by the remarkable Julie Christie a whore, madam and opium smoker who has big ideas and dreams earns both a lot of money which attracts the attention of a corporation which makes an offer to McCabe to buy his holdings.This is not a fast moving film, nor a shoot em up western, its a character study set in the old west that can be broken down a series of vignettes really.Although the film is directed by Altman the influence of Beatty cannot be ignored. An actor who is choosy about his projects and is hardly ever just an actor in the films he appears in once he became a star. This is a daring and risky project for Beatty and over time it has rewarded him as the film has been generally regarded as a classic.

Two years later Robert Altman gave us a northwestern version with the quirky, groundbreaking Mc Cabe and Mrs. Miller. It's initial release met with both critical and commercial failure but time has redeemed and elevated it to classic status.The plot revolves around a rather rough and tumble mining town called Presbyterian Church. The major characters are McCabe the gambler, frontier entrepreneur and Mrs. Miller, manager and half owner of the local bordello. Warren Beatty and Julie Christie give solid performances as well as the large supporting cast (Keith Carradine, Shelley Duvall, Burt Remsen and other Altman regulars)of non-stereotypical stereotypes (gamblers, gunfighters whores). The real star however is the set design and the camera-work of Vilmos Zsigmond. From the smoky lit interiors to the shabby town being covered in snow ( perfectly serenaded by the lugubrious Leonard Cohen) it is one of the most visually poetic westerns ever made.What gives it an added edge is the cynicism of its characters who all follow in some way a form of religious capitalism. Thirty five-years later McCabe holds up better than Altman's consensus masterpiece Nashville which crawls along slowly and seems rather smug. The Wild Bunch, Once Upon a Time in the West and Butch Cassidy also pall in comparison by over romanticizing and perpetuating the legend stereotype. Altman in his film will have none of this. Romantic sentiment is a weakness and often has violent consequence. Today McCabe stands alone as an original iconoclastic, tragicomedy (with a small c) western. Time has proved it to be not only the best western of it's era but one of the finest ever. Even if it is an anti-western.

I had seen this movie described as an anti-western, a term I didn't really understand until I actually watched the movie. Director Robert Altman completely guts this movie of any traces of the iconography of the movie western that had developed up to this time. There are no white hats vs. black hats, cowboys and indians, haunting sunsets, heroes standing up for justice, or virginal and/or madonna-like women helping civilize the frontier. All of this pleasant mythology is replaced by whores, liars,sociopathic murderers, opium fiends, a bleak winter landscape, and a hero driven by greed and hubris rather than honor and humility. Altman's American frontier is a land of selfish opportunists rather than noble nation-builders. Women are dependent, one way or another, on their bodies for survival. There are elements of decency and sentiment that filter through the cracks of this grey facade whores with dreams of legitimacy, a cowboy defending the honor of his wife, and more. Still, in this world, the reward for decency more often than not is death. Although slow moving, the movie is quite watchable. Given the absence of conventions to guide the viewer, there is actual suspense as to where the story is going. The unvarnished and frank presentations of sex, vulgarity, and violence produce genuine emotional responses. They are integral to the themes of the film and thus have no air of gratuity or sensationalism.

Basically, set in the time near the beginning of the 20th Century, during the winter, charismatic but not all that intelligent gambler John McCabe (Warren Beatty) arrives in the town of Presbyterian Church, in the Old West, makes his name as a businessman amongst the town of miners, and he soon establishes a makeshift brothel. Englishwoman and opium-addicted professional madam Constance Miller (Oscar nominated Julie Christie) arrives and convinces McCabe she could manage the brothel better, so they become business partners and make it more successful, and their time together brings them closer together and a love interest develops. The town becomes richer, and from Harrison Shaughnessy mining company in the nearby town of Bearpaw a pair of agents want to buy the brothel business, Shaughnessy notoriously kill people who refuse deals, McCabe ignores warnings from Miller in negotiations, and he has no idea the violence that may ensue. Soon three bounty hunters are hired to kill McCabe, he refuses to leave the town and is clearly afraid of the gunmen, but he is stuck in the middle of this showdown and prepared for the lethal confrontation, arming himself and hiding wherever he can. A fire is started in the church, and McCabe evading death manages to kill two of the assassins, the townspeople are seen gathering to stop the fire, the hero is mortally wounded being shot, but he kills the third man, he is seen dying alone in the snow, while Mrs. Miller visits a place to get opium.

It is obvious that they love each other, but they never have the courage to say it to each other. Their relationship is ambiguous.

And why not? Made right at the nexus of his cult status as a maverick, coming off of winning the golden palm for MASH, he had Warren Beatty and Julie Christie making a western where they all spat on the shoes of Wayne and Cooper and all the old fogies of movie westerns to put something uglier, cruder, and more honest in the sense of the spirit of the really gloomy towns of the North-West areas of the US. It's also got some of the most significant work from Altman as a real film 'stylist' (in quasi-quotes for a reason), as many times when watching an Altman film it looks like it's almost substance *over* style, as if one isn't aware what the camera or the edits are doing through the improvised feel and the emphasis on behavior and idiosyncrasies of the actors. This is an exception; here he and Vilmos Zsigmond make just the look of the picture ironic to the context of the subject matter it's a bright filter for most scenes, accentuating all of the browns and grays and dark areas of the outside mud and the inside whorehouse and saloon, and the red lights of the hallways. From a cinematographer's standpoint (and even Kubrick attested to it in not knowing how Altman shot a particular outdoor scene), it is a masterpiece.It took a little while, however, for me to warm up to the movie at first. The first time I started watching it I turned it off after the first fifteen minutes despite having some interest in the uniquely off-beat performance from Warren Beatty as the drunken, grumbling gunslinger-turned-businessman John McCabe, I couldn't stand the Leonard Cohen songs. Not that Cohen doesn't have some good songs that he's done here and there (the best were used in another 1971 film, Fata Morgana by Herzog), but it's almost kind of dull hearing the opening intro Stranger Song. I gave the film another chance, and somehow I didn't mind the songs after a while- not because they got better on a repeat listen, but for how Altman also worked them into a bizarre form of irony, and not simply for a comedic gesture, perhaps. There's the scene, for example, where the prostitute goes ballistic and stabs the man outside, McCabe tries to intervene to stop her as the man flops around bleeding everywhere, and a Cohen song plays (I forget which) that sounds like it should be used to get a litte child to sleep. Altman uses the Cohen songs much like an old professional would use a western song for emphasis, but for different effect, and it starts to work but better.But back to the film itself despite a first half hour that takes a little getting adjusted to- the pace of it and texture of the dialog, which despite being quintessential Altman is almost too much (and, as many have pointed out aside from the die-hard fans, the sound mix is ghastly and not in a good way)- this is a truly fascinating picture, a tale of ambition obfuscated by escapism into the self, either by prostitutes or booze or opium, and how the moral codes of the old west are nowhere to be found, aside from the greedy business-owners who want to buy out the stubborn mule that is ol' McCabe. Beatty plays him totally unsympathetically, which turns it into a riveting turn he's a real jackass most times, repeating his 'frog had wings' joke despite it never making sense, and too thick-headed, in one of the only Western clichés used, to know a good deal when he sees one. Julie Christie, as the more head-strong but still corruptible and estranged madam of the whorehouse, is also perfect for the role, a part that demands some strength and intelligence, but at the same time needs some weird kind of vulnerability when she goes down her dark path late in the film.This doesn't mean that Altman is totally allergic to all things that come with the traditional western, but as the climactic shoot-out comes along it's less exciting in the traditional sense (and Altman's form of subversion is a far cry from someone like Leone) because of what's now become of the main character. We see the same depth of existential gone-to-hell thinking that goes in the best of westerns, but Altman doesn't allow ever an easy answer or a kind character out of left field. And this approach is almost to the point of stifling it leans so much into criticizing the genre in its own storytelling that it threatens to become self-conscious. Yet on its own McCabe & Mrs Miller ends up as a testament to the genre while something of a reprieve; we'll never quite see one as grungy, with the actors looking as though it were neo-realist in comparison to a John Ford picture, and with a wicked frontier wit again, but then who would want to try something like this again- unless it's The Proposition?

Altman does everything he can to lull a viewer to sleep. Altman made one great movie - MASH. And that's it. This will be the last of his films I'll ever watch. I watched this one because I felt I couldn't completely write him off without viewing it. I mean, does any other director come off as amateurish with the camera? He's written some good stuff. The script isn't bad. But I swear, he sits there with the camera on the tripod (Mamet would be so proud) and his expert use of the camera is the ZOOM! The Gingerbread Man really convinced me that Altman was one of the most overrated directors around. This just proves that he's always been overrated. Don't waste your time.

The video would probably be better on a big screen, but it's still heavy on dark interiors and overly red lighting. Many important details are almost impossible to see. Again, it might be better on a big screen, but the light will still be too dim to see important details.I don't mind the overlapping dialog -- I love Nashville and Ready to Wear. But I don't like having to put so much effort into just understanding the words. It's one thing to overlap dialog, it's another to mumble constantly. Altman's main movies may be confusing in places, but there's little mumbling in them, either aurally or visually.The cold, wet, dirty environment is great realism. The church fire is total fantasy. A fire that well developed would not be approachable, and the buckets of water they throw on it would not even slow it down -- just mist to a fire that size.

A good example of this comes in an otherwise throwaway scene with William Devane as an unnamed lawyer that McCabe seeks advice from on how to battle the company that is trying to muscle him out of the action. Devane tells him that he can be a hero, and strike a stand for the little man against corporations that plunder the environment, but, as McCabe is an inveterate con artist, the idea that he would buy such hippy-drenched drivel is laughable; especially considering such advice is tantamount to a death warrant.Overall, McCabe & Mrs. Miller is not a terrible film, although a viewer does not care, much less identify, with any of the characters, but it is not a good film, even if one, Heaven forfend, actually finds Leonard Cohen's songs somehow interesting, and it is certainly nowhere in the universe known as perfection, period.

It reminds the viewer how gorgeous Julie Christie was in her day. And it displays Rene Auberjonois at his fumbling, bumbling best.I did not see this film when it was first issued. I went back to it mainly because of Robert Altman, whom I regard as one the greatest directors of all times. But this is not one of Altman's best. It is an ordinary Western, ending in a gun fight that is telegraphed from the very beginning.Warren Beatty, as a thick-headed entrepreneur (bar and whore house), unable to recognize that the people who want to buy him out will kill him if he declines to deal, is simply Warren Beatty with a heavy beard. He brings nothing special to the role. I for one couldn't care less whether he lived or died at the end. I simply wanted the movie to be over.Julie Christie, the itinerant madam who becomes his partner, isn't given a lot to do except look beautiful, which she does, particularly in the final scene which is set in an opium den. There Altman focuses in, especially on her eyes.Frankly, I don't understand what others have seen in this movie that appears to have eluded me. It's atmospheric, true. But it's not a character study. It lacks tension. It is routine in the extreme. The main interest, in the final gunfight, is how long Beatty's character will manage to remain alive against three hired guns.I suppose it is of minor interest that he kills all three of his enemies but dies in the snow a few feet away from possible safety of the two gun shots wounds he received during the fight. That may pass for originality in circles which expect the Western hero or anti-hero to win or to die spectacularly. To me it's simply a tiny twist in a mediocre picture from a great director.

Rather than being the masterpiece that some people claim, it looks rushed and unfinished. Altman seems to have been lazy in his direction. The sound and lighting are poor but no one seems to mind - it's adds to the atmosphere they claim - no it doesn't it just looks technically inept. I felt like I'd watched a very long student production - someone at film school trying to be different but failing miserably. The plot is confused - it's not complex just muddled without clear development. The acting is unconvincing. The soundtrack is uninspiring. Totally overrated.
