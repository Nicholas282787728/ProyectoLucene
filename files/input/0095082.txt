For all that its about baseball players, it is NOT a baseball movie.  The Black Sox scandal and its effect on baseball transcended baseball.  The ensemble cast does a marvelous job, particularly Straithairn and Sweeney, who plays Shoeless Joe Jackson, one of the more tragic figures of the whole mess.  In spite of taking money to throw the Series, Jackson went out and batted .375 for the Series.  The Chicago payers in on the payoff (and one poor soul who didn't go along, but was approached) were banned from baseball for life.  No less an authority than Ted Williams believes Jackson should be in the Hall of Fame.  But I digress.  The film goes into the motivations of the players, who were playing for a pittance and had no say over where they played.  Thus they were perfect targets for the fix in the first place.  Excellent and gripping film about human reactions to stress and temptation.  Most recommended.

He claims that there wasn't enough exposition. I found everything explained satisfactorily, even for the non-fan or baseball history buff. And it is period-piece film-making at its finest. I cannot imagine a better telling of this story. And the baseball action is excellent. One factual error, though Bucky Weaver (John Cusack) would never mention Babe Ruth as better (or even comparable) to Cobb, Speaker and Wheat in 1919 or 1920. It shocks me that Sayles kept that line.

Incredibly handsome and lavish-looking for a low-budget indie, it's a meticulous re-creation of the first huge scandal in American professional sports, and the beginning of the loss of innocence in pro baseball (and American popular culture by extension). If that makes it sound a bit dry, let it be said that the characterizations are vivid, the characters multilayered, the costumes gorgeous, and the staging of the baseball games unusually convincing. (Ever notice how movie stars can't really fake pro-athlete moves? Watch John Cusack charge an outfield fly, or Charlie Sheen slide into third--they had me convinced.) In a uniformly excellent cast, David Strathairn's morally tortured star pitcher is especially impressive, as is John Mahoney's manager, alternately loving and despising his players, his eroding trust etched on his expressive face. And what a wonderful touch having Studs Terkel play a cynical sportswriter He's the essence of Chicago style.Some of the facts of the story are necessarily simplified or omitted to keep the movie under two hours, but there's not a moment of dishonesty or Field of Dreams-type goo. By the time the kid is looking Joe Jackson in the eye and pleading, Say it ain't so, you'll probably be sniffling.A high-water mark in the career of a great, versatile, underappreciated moviemaker.

While `Eight Men Out' may not quite grab the non-sports enthusiast as well as `Field of Dreams,' `Hoosiers' or `A League of Their Own,' (my own nominations for the three best sports-related movies of all-time), it DOES more than hold its own among the top third of the ever-growing list of baseball movies.This is largely because it is not really a  BASEBALL movie. Like the aforementioned films, it is a movie about people who happen to PLAY baseball. Based on the Eliot Asinof novel, the movie is, by and large, historically accurate. It also seems to be fairly even-handed in dishing out guilt. Yes, the players played for skinflint Charles `Old Roman' Comiskey, yes they were easy prey for the gambling element, yes they were lacking in education and common sense &#133; yet they are not portrayed as innocent victims, either.I have been a huge David Strathairn fan ever since `Eight Men Out.' His sensitive portrayal of star pitcher Eddie Cicotte was pivotal to the movie's success. Asinof correctly focused on Cicotte as the pivotal figure in the World Series fix. `Eddie's the key!' more than one character exclaimed. Other players, approached with the idea of throwing the series, reacted with shock when finding out the highly-respected Cicotte was involved. This was certainly no easy choice for Cicotte, a man of some integrity and conscience, but a pitcher nearing the end of his salad days and a man bitter at his mistreatment by Comiskey. Strathairn plays the intelligent, stressed character under the gun as well as any actor of his generation.The rest of the cast is fine, too, with despicable Chick Gandil (Michael Rooker) and Swede Risberg (Don Harvey) playing the odds and pressuring teammates to go along. James Read is excellent as henpecked southern pitcher Claude `Lefty' Williams, probably the second most respected player on the team.  Of course Buck Weaver (John Cusack) is a huge figure, considering the gamblers' pitch, then opting to pass when the money isn't immediately forthcoming. The movie isn't shy about its version of good guys & bad guys. Gandil, Risberg & Swede's buddy Fred McMullin (Perry Lang) are the villains, while Williams, Weaver, Joe Jackson (D.B. Sweeney) and Manager Kid Gleason (John Mahoney) are victims. Hall of Famer Eddie Collins (Bill Irwin) and no-nonsense catcher (and controversial Hall of Famer) Ray Schalk (Gordon Clapp) are frustrated on-lookers, while Dickie Kerr (Jace Alexander) is the wide-eyed & naïve rookie. All turn in fine work and I find myself loving the taciturn Schalk, the kind of catcher every manager wants. Most interesting is the movie's portrayal of Shoeless Joe, who is interpreted as being mildly retarded, rather than just illiterate.The baseball scenes are quite realistic, as are the ballpark backdrops. I first saw it the year after visiting Old Comiskey Park (the year before it was torn down) and felt right at home on the movie set &#150; even the turnstiles looked authentic.In closing, I can't honestly say that someone with NO knowledge or interest in baseball would flip over this film. Yet, one doesn't have to be a bleacher bum to enjoy it &#150; and not knowing the outcome may actually make it MORE fun for the neophyte! Overall, a fine movie.  "},{"Title":"Beautiful, Devastating. The Finest Baseball Film Ever Made.","Date":"24 July 2002","Score":"27 out of 34 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, History, Sport","Review":"  When people talk about their favorite baseball movies, you always hear the same titles being tossed around. Bull Durham, Field of Dreams, and of course, these are terrific movies. But I don't think any one movie has so perfectly caputured the game, the public's love and obsession with it, and how fragile and vulnerable the men whos play it can be. John Sayles movie, from Eliot Asinof's impeccably researched book, so perfectly caputres America in 1919, and paints the Black Sox scandal as a tragedy, whereby men capable of great things are brought down to the level of theives and gangsters by something as simple as greed, and as awful as revenge. What sets this movie apart, to me, is the cast. There is an athleticism about this cast. Charlie Sheen had a scholarship to play ball at Kansas State, and is well known for his passion for baseball. D.B. Sweeney, who is simply remarkable as Shoeless Joe Jackson, the illiterate hitting machine, whose tragedy also spawned the novel Shoeless Joe by W.P. Kinsella, which served as the source for Field of Dreams, played minor league ball before a motorcycle accident ended his career. They look and play like ballplayers. In far too many films there is something horribly fake about the baseball aspect. Some capture baseball scenes perfectly, and simply haven't the emotional, real life depth that a movie needs, while others capture plenty on the emotional side but fall short in terms of the realism on the field. This movie is a rare GEM that captures both so well. The acting is terrific. Sweeny, as said, does a fantastic job, as do John Mahoney as the team's manager, and the terrific character player Michael Rooker (who oddly is only good in movies where he isn't highly billed...for example, don't see Jean Claude Van Damme and Michael Rooker in Replicant...) as Chick Gandil, the first baseman whose shady connections initiate the whole gambling scenario. But the standout performance has to be John Cusack as third-baseman Buck Weaver. His being drawn into the scandal's backlash is by far the most devastating part of this film, as he is the moral center of the film, torn between his love of his teammates, and his loyalty to the integrity of a game he loves, and never got over the loss of. Simply Remarkable.

The movie features an excellent cast and does a nice job of re-creating the era. The music of period is effectively used here, too, as are the interior and exterior of the ballpark.The most memorable players seemed to be pitcher Eddie Cicotte (David Strathairn) and infielder Buck Weaver (John Cusack). Cicotte, being the ace pitcher on the staff, was the key player involved in fixing the 1919 World Series and Weaver stood out because he was made to look as a totally-innocent player who got unfairly blackballed from pro baseball. At least this is according to John Sayles, who directed the film. Sayles also shows Shoeless Joe Jackson, the most famous player of that scandal, to be just a naive, kind of dumb guy who didn't know what was going on. (However, history records Jackson making an unusual number of throwing errors in the field, which makes him suspect.)Sayles also goes out of his way to make Chicago White Sox owner Charles Comiskey as a notorious tightwad who invited this sort of thing (players taking bribes) by grossly underpaying his players. They also make a point of showing him screwing Cicotte out of a big bonus. The filmmakers almost make the crooks into the good guys! Gosh, Hollywood would never do that! So, as you can see, so don't take this story as gospel. I'm sure some of it is very true, but how much?The baseball scenes are realistic in the field but aren't all that credible pitching and hitting. Note Sayles has an acting role in here as does real-life sportswriter Studs Terkel, who isn't a bad actor! Michael Lerner, Charlie Sheen, Christopher Lloyd, Michael Rooker, Clifton James all add to this deep cast.

They're very droll. They act as a kind of Greek chorus, making cynical wisecracks, keeping the audience clued in on what's supposed to be going on. As the White Sox play out yet another crooked game, Sayles said to Terkel, Nothing but fast balls. Nice, sloow ones, adds Terkel. It gets better. Terkel writes a column for the Chicago paper accusing gamblers of corrupting the game of baseball and Sayles is reading it aloud. Writers are tainting the game, or something, says Sayles. Keep reading, says Terkel. The game would be better off without the long-nosed, thick-lipped Eastern element preying on our boys in the field. Terkels smiles around his cigar and says, Makes you proud to be a sportswriter, doesn't it?The rest of the movie is pretty good too, although I sometimes get the characters and their motives a little mixed up. The baseball scenes are very well done. I say this, being no big fan of the sport myself. Charlie Sheen (a true aficionado) looks like he's heaving a heavy bat as he clunks out a hit, not a rubber prop. I admired too the way the series games swung back and forth as the players on the take tried to figure out if they were playing for the money or for themselves. It's tough to throw a game because part of one's self always wants to do what one does best -- in this case, play baseball well. The German ethologists call it Funktionslust. In the end, despite some indecision, they do however lose.The movie isn't kind to the gamblers or to the owners. Comisky was incredibly cheap and greedy. The script gives this as one of the reasons why the players agreed to throw the game. As Strathairn says when someone offers him a part payment, I don't care about the money. He's throwing the games to foul up Comisky who has just denied him a promised bonus because Strathairn, playing the pitcher Cicotte, has only played 29 games instead of the 30 they'd agreed upon. Comisky has made him sit on the bench for the last few games so he wouldn't cross the bonus threshold. (Question Given that Comisky cheated Cicotte of the contracted bonus, was Cicotte morally justified in throwing the games?) The movie isn't nice to the gamblers either. Not only don't they pay off but they treat the players with contempt. Arnold Rothstein (A.R.) treats EVERYBODY rudely. He never says hello when he enters a room, never says good-bye when leaving, and never smiles.I kind of liked this. Sayles may not be a master but his films are always highly individualized. I cannot visualize him directing Die Hard With A Sardonic Grin.

Sure Babe Ruth was coming into his own by 1920, but most ballplayers in that era would not have place Ruth in the class of Cobb, Tris Speaker or Walter Johnson. For baseball fans, this line in particular really comes off as shallow, especially since the rest of the film really tries to capture the dead-ball era. For the most part though, this film feels and sounds a lot like America right after World War I ends, a fascinating time and place.Studs Terkel steals the show in my estimation. His character in the film is not far from whom he is in real life and his authenticity is undeniable. John Sayles is a little stiff by comparison and his singing in the railway car (which according to legend did actually happen), is rather difficult to bear. None the less, his direction makes up for his foibles as an actor.Straitharn is another gem in this movie, and once again this actor seems to get right to the soul of the characters he is given to play. Eddie Cicotte's dilemmas are written all over Straitharn's face in every scene, he's also given some of the best dialog in the film. Cusack plays his part well, despite the fact that many of his scenes are reduced to clichés. Cusack's best moments are when he is frustrated about his inclusion in the conspiracy trial, despite the fact he gave his all to try and win the series. His outbursts in the courtroom seem perfect, as if drawn from the trial transcripts themselves.Joe Jackson is given unfair treatment. If Field of Dreams mythologizes Jackson to point of hyperbole, Eight Men Out plays up his illiteracy with too much of a heavy hand. Joe Jackson wasn't stupid, indeed if you read his last major interview before he died, he speaks about the Black Sox with great alacrity and clarity. He was not as ignorant as this film would have you believe. One day someone will produce a film about Joe Jackson, that will portray him accurately, but Eight Men Out is not that film.Although their roles are very minor, Kid Gleason and Ray Schalk are really well played and written. These two went through a very difficult time during the series, and this is well demonstrated. One minor beef is that Nemo Leibold, Shano Collins and other players outside of the conspiracy are never touched upon at all. This is understandable to a degree given the relatively short length of the film, despite the complexity of the subject matter.The baseball scenes themselves are well done. The bats, balls, gloves and uniforms look like the equipment of that era and the ballparks are successful mock ups for the most part. There are even a couple of nifty athletic displays in the outfield that must have taken several takes to pull off.Overall, this is my second favorite baseball movie, next to Bull Durham. Its a little light on some of the details of the conspiracy, but it makes up for it in other areas. It has some great music, some great sets, some solid acting and overall seems genuine and fair to all the major players in the conspiracy.Eight Men Out isn't perfect, but it isn't as flawed as Roger Ebert would have you believe. If you a fan of baseball in fact, I'd say its mandatory viewing.

Eight of the heavily favored members of the Chicago White Sox threw the World Series as a result of payoffs and bigger promises of payoffs to gambling interests. In the background of those interests was the notorious Arnold Rothstein who was never brought to trial. The eight players were the Eight Men Out, banned for life by the newly appointed Commissioner of Baseball, Kenesaw Mountain Landis played here most impressively by John Anderson. Anderson even looks like Landis.The whole unvarnished truth is laid out there, owner Charles Comiskey a pioneer owner in the American League who treated his players like field hands as he assiduously courted the press and through them the fans. A little more generous with the profits this story might never have occurred. Clifton James plays the greedy and rapacious Comiskey. The incident where Eddie Cicotte is not started so that Comiskey can save on a promised bonus if he pitched and won 30 games has come down in legend. Cicotte and Lefty Williams played by David Strathairn and James Read were the key to the conspiracy. They lost the five games in that best five out of nine series to the Reds to throw the series. The bad play in the field by the others insured the result.Two things that are not mentioned in the film, but are very important; viewers ought to know. The best pitcher the White Sox had was Hall of Famer Urban 'Red' Faber who had led the team to a World Series win in 1917, the last one they would have until 2005. Faber came up injured and was disabled and was not available to pitch in the 1919 series. Had he stayed honest and not been injured, the result might have been different.Eddie Collins the second baseman was played here by Bill Irwin and what's not mentioned here is that Collins started out with Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics, part of his fabled $100,000.00 infield. When Mack broke up his team and sold off the players in 1941-1915, Collins got a guaranteed salary of $15,000.00, way above what his teammates were getting. Collins was one of Mack's favorites and he got that salary guaranteed for him by Comiskey before parting with him. That caused a lot of the jealousy you see portrayed in Eight Men Out.The real ringleaders were shortstop Swede Risberg and first baseman Chick Gandil as is shown here. They roped the others in. They're played by Don Harvey and Michael Rooker.The two that come down to us as the biggest tragedies are John Cusack as Buck Weaver and D.B. Sweeney as Shoeless Joe Jackson. Weaver knew about the fix, but would not rat out his teammates, hoping they'd come around and play on the square. He was treated as if he were a conspirator himself and suffered the same banishment.As for Shoeless Joe Jackson, his lifetime average of .356 and the fact that he is one of the select group of .400 hitters would put him in the Hall of Fame. During the teen years he was overshadowed by Ty Cobb in the American League, but in the Twenties might have come into his own. He showed signs of adapting to the lively ball era that Babe Ruth was just inaugurating. He was also illiterate and was easily manipulated into the fix. Despite that his play like Weaver's was outstanding in that series, he hit the only home run recorded by either side in that next to last series of the dead ball era. What you see with D.B. Sweeney is exactly how poor Jackson was.Baseball like other sports is a business and some of those businessmen are greedy indeed. Sad that it was the players who paid the ultimate price to clean up the sport in the mind of the public. Eight Men Out captures the era and mood of the times and even non-sports fans will enjoy this film immensely.

John Sayles took an incredibly complex story with at least eight memorable characters, and made a coherent and entertaining period drama. That should be enough, and yet -- somehow it's not. EIGHT MEN OUT fails for a number of reasons. First of all, the left-leaning Sayles is trying to be an advocate for the despised working class. This would be fine, but somehow he transforms eight tough, hardened men into limp, passive, oddly childlike characters. An earlier poster got it right when he mentioned that Buck Weaver was not nearly this nice in real life. Not that these men were MEAN, but they were hard men in a hard time. In this movie, Swede Risberg coaxes and flatters Joe Jackson into joining the conspiracy. In real life he threatened to break his face. John Cusack plays Buck Weaver as Bambi, all helpless and innocent when the bad men take his bat and ball away. By the same token, Joe Jackson (who had been in the Big Leagues since 1911) was certainly old enough and tough enough to know what he was getting into. The film portrays him as borderline retarded, with the face of a twelve year old. Is this the best Sayles can do when coming to terms with an American tragedy? And what's with the cute little kids, anyway? Readers of James T. Farrel's STUDS LONIGAN trilogy will know that the boys of Chicago's South Side in 1919 were more like the savage club and razor-wielding droogs of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE than these McCauley Culkin wanna-be's. Maybe Sayles was getting his casting tips from Michael Jackson!   I humbly suggest that the real Buck Weaver was probably much harder, more cynical, and more used to being brutalized -- less Bambi, more Brando in ON THE WATERFRONT. Instead of coming across as complex and honorable, the movie portrays Weaver as a weak-willed sap. I don't suppose we could have expected HAMLET, but maybe something along the lines of THE WILD BUNCH would have worked. Buck Weaver is clearly Deke Thornton, while Chick Gandil is Pike Bishop. Regrettably, however, Sayles is paralyzed by his socialist school of naturalism, and is unable to imagine working men as anything other than passive victims. Another reason the film fails is that Sayles takes an entirely false and self-congratulatory tone when depicting the two sports writers, Ring Lardner and Hughie Fullerton. These men are depicted as being above suspicion simply because they are sportswriters. In other words, white collar workers are men of integrity by definition, while blue collar workers are easily led astray. This is the leftist genius? But watch the film and you will see that Sayles never asks the most obvious questions about Ring Lardner. Didn't he know the Sox were underpaid? Didn't he take management's side against the players for years? Wasn't he just as exploitative as Comiskey himself? The movie presents Lardner as a crusading truth teller, when in reality he was a moral coward who always backed the status quo. To sum up, then. By refusing to treat the White Sox as men, by refusing to make hard choices and state uncompromising truths, Sayles has opted out of tragedy, and settled for pathos.

In fact, so close in focus was I that the assistant director eventually told me that they couldn't use me any more, because I had been seen, meaning, I guess, that people would notice me in several different scenes. Not only did I learn about the baseball history depicted, but I learned about movie making, too. I worked at several of the Indianapolis shooting locations, including the Scottish Rite Cathedral, and what was then Victory Field, the home of the Triple A Indianapolis Indianapolis Indians. It was trippy filming there, as I had been there for many games over the years as an Indians fan. For some of the shots, they couldn't get enough extras to show up to make the crowd, so they had to put cardboard cut-outs (called standees now?) in the stadium seats. The first day I showed up, I met the extras casting director, Avy Kaufman...she said, I like your face, and sent me to wardrobe to get my period suit, shoes and hat---I was in! Thus began what would be a string of very long---but rewarding---days, for the grand sum of $20 per day, cash, paid out of a box in the semi-darkened parking lot. One day we did a double shift---16 hours---and got paid $40. We were fed in the same room, but not at the same table, as the actors. It was really neat being just a few feet away from these actors, some of whom I had seen in sitcoms and movies...Mahoney from Cheers, Lloyd from Back to the Future, Anderson from, among others, a Twilight Zone episode, and, of course, Studa Turkel and John Sayles. And note one other young actor in the cast Charlie Sheen---should have gotten his autograph while I had the chance! The man who played the jury foreman, Rich Komenich had, years before, dressed up in a costume for a popular areas pizza franchise, and I had partied with him thanks to a woman I date. I remember the frequent chemical odor from the smoke or fog machine,since they fogged most of the indoor shots, apparently to cover up certain set details. Then there were the crude antique flash units we reporters had to hold up when when they shot the press conference held by Clifton James' character, Commiskey, the laborious to lace up period shoes that were closer to boots,the molded plastic ice cubes in the cocktail glasses we used in Michael Lerner's Rothstein scene, and the infrequent mouthing of nonsense lines to fake conversation of the background extras. If I had been a smoker, I would have been standing right next to Lerner in that scene, but I couldn't fake proficiency at a habit I didn't have. Perhaps what was more surrealistic than anything else was the contrast between how some of the extras looked in their period costumes, and how they looked in their street clothes before or after we changed...everything from gym shorts and t-shirts to overalls.

Writer director John Sayles succeeds in showing exactly how and why eight players on the best team in baseball set in motion what had to be one of the most poorly conceived, organized and executed conspiracies in the whole history of graft, and in his usual role as a champion of the working class portrays the guilty players as victims of money-grubbing corporate exploitation (represented both by team management and organized crime).But it's all the cynical wheeling and dealing behind the Black Sox scandal which make the film so fascinating. The story might have been unbelievable if it wasn't entirely true, but like any aspect of real life the details are messy and inconclusive. Most of the film recounts the mechanics of the fix; events during the subsequent exposure and trial are telescoped too quickly into the final forty minutes or so, which makes sense in any conspiracy the crime is always more interesting than the punishment.It helps to be at least slightly familiar with the huge cast of characters involved players, gamblers, reporters and so forth. A few scenes have been added for dramatic unity, and others were abbreviated to maintain a consistent pace, but all the facts are there, and Sayles manages to pull them all together in an entertaining history lesson from our collective adolescence, re-creating that fateful moment when the boys of summer grew up for good.

It's a story that anyone interested in a history of America, a history of labor and management, a history of the greatest game will definitely enjoy. After reading it, the Shoeless Joe character from Field of Dreams suddenly has a resonance which that particular film could never explain (though it is nicely explained in the source for that film Shoeless Joe) Also worth reading is The Glory of Their Times an oral history of early baseball.

The movie is a dramatization of the events before, during, and after the 1919 World Series. I found this movie both fascinating and moving.Director Sayles--who also plays journalist Ring Lardner--has formulated the film as a labor vs. management struggle. Sayles portrays club owner Charles Comiskey as a miserly, selfish, dictatorial boss. His team was the finest in baseball, yet he underpaid them, broke promises to them, and got rich while they remained poor. From this perspective, most of the players were easy targets for gamblers, who arranged for them throw the series and collect the cash offered to them.The acting was excellent, especially by John Cusack, who played George 'Buck' Weaver. Weaver maintained that he was innocent until the day he died, and Cusack made that position believable. Also excellent was Hugh Fullerton who played journalist Studs Terkel.If you love baseball, this is a can't-miss movie. If you don't love baseball, I still recommend it. That's because it's very dramatic, and it really is a labor film as much as it's a baseball film. We saw the movie in the wonderful Dryden Theatre in George Eastman House, in Rochester, NY. It was part of the excellent Rochester Labor Film Series.It was a treat to see an original print of the film projected on the large screen at the Dryden.

These aren't your ordinary movie stars who try to fake being an athlete, these guys do it all. John Cusack dives at third base to snag some rough liners. Charlie Sheen runs into a wall, by catching a tough flyball in the outfield. David Strathairn looks and feels like a knuckleball pitcher. It was very well done. The court scene at the end involving the whole ordeal was intense. Performances John Cusack is the morally superior character here. He is excellent as Buck Weaver and very likable as well. You'll feel for him a bit at the end. David Strathairn is the morally conflicted one, and his low-key, yet powerful performance was great to watch.

Not being an American baseball fan or otherwise greatly familiar with the story, I did a fair bit of reading up on the subject beforehand and was pleased to see that the movie stays pretty close to the characters and events as they actually unfolded. To this day, there's controversy over whether the disgraced star player Shoeless Joe Jackson ever actually had the famous phrase Say it ain't so Joe thrown at him by a disillusioned young fan, but the apocryphal quote coupled with Jackson's mute response is so much part of popular culture that the film-makers just couldn't exclude it.It also underpins one of the main themes of the film, disillusionment and misplaced hero-worship as the talented but sorely undervalued Chicago baseball team fall in with a bunch of on-the-make shyster crooks who lead them to the Mr Big behind the fix which will see them tank the World Series against Cincinatti for some ready cash. The story is a sad one, the only winner in the end being said Mr Big, Albert Rothstein, whose last scene in the film is his exiting from a bookie's after only two balls of the first game, having learned from this that the fix was on (the Chicago pitcher signalling it by deliberately hitting an opposing batter with an early throw). The offending players saw little if any of the money promised them and in a bitter-sweet ending to the film we see their short-lived joy at obtaining a somewhat dubious acquittal of all criminal charges (helped by their signed confessions mysteriously disappearing before being offered in evidence) dashed the very next day by then picking up lifetime bans from the sport from its newly appointed hard-line Commissioner.The story is so strong that for the film to work it only remains for the director to evoke the era and stay true to the tale. This John Sayles does handsomely, with first rate cinematography and costumery, more than backed up by excellent ensemble acting by a no-big-name cast. The matches themselves are likewise convincingly recreated (at least they seemed so to my untutored eyes) and the drama, with the tensions in the Chicago team between the fixers and their honest colleagues (the latter including the team's disbelieving but still trusting coach) honestly represented.This film transcends its genre as a sports movie with its use of baseball and its treatment of its lifeblood employees (i.e. the players) as a microcosm of society as a whole. As ever, the poor little guy loses big reaching up while the rich guy (whether under the cloak of respectability and authority, as personified by the despotic baseball team owners or the no more culpable Teflon-coated underworld kingpins) makes a fortune looking down.

Sweeney, John Cusack, Charlie Sheen, James Read, Don Harvey, Gordon Clapp and Michael Rooker are Eight Men Out in this John Sayles movie about the throwing of the 1919 World Series by the Chicago White Sox. It's another pathetic story of how money can corrupt even usually honest people. The film shows that part of the reason the players caved was that their boss, Charles Comiskey (Clifton James) underpaid his team and worse than that, was a welsher, making unkept promises to get good performances out of the players. Sadly, Buck Weaver (Cusack) refused to throw any games but was accused anyway, and spent the rest of his life trying to clear his name. Say it ain't so, Joe, spoken by a young boy to Shoeless Joe Jackson, demonstrates the hero worship these men enjoyed from the public - which is one reason why they were found not guilty. An independent commissioner, however, banned them from baseball for life.John Sayles has done a terrific job both on the screenplay and in his direction of these fine actors. Though this was a low-budget movie, it looks like a big studio film all the way, and the dramatization of the events keeps you hooked the casual way Lefty Williams' wife's life is threatened if the next game isn't lost; the poor circumstances under which Buck Weaver and his wife lived - just think of the players today; Joe Jackson putting an X on his witness statement, unable to write and many other moments.Sayles takes his time leading up to the actual trial, giving great detail about what led up to the throwing of the games. So many screenwriters today have lost the art of the build-up - not Sayles. Getting to the point in the first five minutes isn't as important to him as character and story development. It's rare, and he's to be commended.Standout performances come from David Straithairn as pitcher Eddie Cicotte, who would never have gone along had not Comisky reneged on his bonus. Straithairn is one of the finest actors today, and his guilt, suppressed anger and unhappiness permeated his performance all the way through the film. John Mahoney is great as Gleason, the manager, who can't hide his disappointment but in the end, sticks up for his players; Michael Lerner as the disgusting Arnold Rothstein, portrayed as a discourteous man who likes to throw his large weight around; and of course, John Cusack, who has heartbreak reading on his face as he desperately tries to play his best game while his teammates seek to throw it.The players never saw all of the money they were promised. Instead of going into the record books as outstanding players, they went in as crooks, all for a couple of thousand dollars. They learned the hard way that some things -- such as your reputation and honesty - are more important than money. Unfortunately, some of today's players still haven't learned that hard lesson.

This movie about the 1919 Chicago White Sox - known to history as the Black Sox - makes that point. The '19 Sox were the odds-on favourites to beat the Cincinnati Reds and win that Year's World Series, but - upset at their treatment by the Sox skinflint owner Charles Comiskey (Clifton James) they conspired with gamblers to throw the Series.It's an excellent movie, told from a perspective that's sympathetic to the players, full of great characters and without a bad performance anywhere. I was particularly taken by John Mahoney's portrayal of manager Kid Gleason, fiercely loyal to his players and finding it unbelievable that they would betray him, then deeply and personally hurt when he discovers that they did - but still testifying in the ensuing trial that they're the greatest team he'd ever seen. I also enjoyed John Cusack's performance as 3rd baseman Buck Weaver (who knew about the scheme but didn't participate in it, although he also didn't report it to anyone), from whose perspective the movie is primarily told.The movie suggests that although the ringleader of the plot was 1st baseman Chick Gandil (Michael Rooker) the key player was pitcher Eddie Cicotte (David Strathairn), who would be starting at least three games in the Series. The movie suggests that Cicotte's reason for agreeing to be a part of this was that he was cheated out of a bonus for winning 30 games after Comiskey ordered him benched after his 29th win. Cicotte says in a meeting with Comiskey that he deserved the bonus because he would have had five more starts without the benching. Apparently the record doesn't bear that out. Cicotte's 29th win came in late September. Even in an era when pitchers pitched far more frequently than they do now, it was unlikely he'd have had five more starts. Apparently he did, however, start two games after his 29th win. One he lost, and his final start was a tune-up for the Series, in which everyone knew he'd only get a few innings in so that he'd be rested for the Series opener. Also, I understand that Cicotte supposedly agreed to the deal on the same day as his 29th win. In other words, he would have had no way of knowing that he wouldn't win 30 at the time the deal was made. Of course, this movie is sympathetic to the players, so this little twist isn't surprising.There's little else to criticize here. In the closing captions, we're told that Shoeless Joe Jackson (D.B. Sweeney) never played major league ball again, and that Buck Weaver unsuccessfully appealed his suspension every year until he died. I would have liked to have been told more about both of them and about the rest of the players involved. What finally happened to them. I know they were all suspended from baseball, but did they make successes of themselves or did they live in bitterness and shame the rest of their lives. The movie doesn't tell us. Still, it's an excellent movie.9/10 "},{"Title":"What do I think of the 1919 Chicago White Sox?

The mob zeroed in on the clubs starting pitchers Eddie Cicotte & Lefty Williams, David Strathairn & James Read, in paying them off to throw the World Series games against the Redlegs.True but sad story about, how what would have been, a team of future Baseball Hall of Famers ending up banned from the game that they loved and played with almost child-like enthusiasm. The two most tragic of the Black Sox players were infielder Bucky Weaver, John Cusack, and who many consider to be the best natural hitter in baseball history Joseph Jefferson Shoeless Joe Jackson, D. B Sweeney. Both were caught up with the illegal events that swirled around them but didn't have the heart to report their fellow players, and friends. Buckey Weaver spent the remainder of his life trying to clear his name and died a broken and forgotten man at the age of 66 in 1956. Joe Jackson who also like Weaver died both obscure and forgotten in 1951 at the age of 63.All the Black Sox players were in fact found innocent in a court of law which came across as anything but a just and honest verdict. With the damage already done to the game of baseball the new Baseball Commissioner for life, who died on the job after 23 years in 1944, Kenesaw Mountain Landis (John Anderson) had them all banned form the game forever and despite their being found innocent of throwing the 1919 World Series he made it stick.Through an ironic quirk of fate baseball was saved and brought back to life bigger and better then ever to become America's favorite past-time the very year that the Black Sox Eight were thrown out of the game in 1920. It's was the hitting exploits of a New York Yankee outfielder, and former Bsoton Red Sox pitcher, George Herman Babe Ruth who made baseball the national pastime that it still is today. Ruth hit a record and unbelievable 54 home run in 1920 and ended up with an astounding record 714 lifetime home runs, that stood for some 40 years, when he retired in 1935. Babe Ruth ended his baseball career in the city where he started it in Boston; this time as an outfielder for the Boston Braves. P.S Babe Ruth had perfected that famous home run swing of his early in his career when he was still a pitcher with the Red Sox! Ruth styled his batting swing, that saved the game of Basebal, after that banned from baseball and forgotten Chicago White Sox outfielder,you guessed it, Joseph Jefferson Shoeless Joe Jackson!

Eight Men Out tells a credible story of players directly and indirectly involved in one of the biggest sports scandals in history, even if the monetary sums involved seem meager by comparison with today.What's illuminating is the way an owner like Charlie Commiskey could get away with reneging on a promise to a star pitcher simply by not playing him and using that tactic against him. If not for Eddie Ciccote's (David Strathairn) disillusionment, how many dominoes would not have fallen to accept the fix offered by big time gamblers? The story of Ciccote, much like the story of Buck Weaver and Shoeless Joe Jackson could probably fill an entire movie by itself.Having recently seen The Sting once again, this picture also compares favorably as a period piece of early Americana. The old uniforms and equipment are on view in abundance, and street scenes convey authenticity. The sight of men in suits with ties at a baseball game still fascinates me; it makes me wonder when things loosened up enough to allow casual attire without showing disrespect for the game.Besides Strathairn, John Cusack delivers a fine performance as 'honest' player Buck Weaver, and D.B. Sweeney is effectively understated as Joe Jackson. You'll also recognize Charlie Sheen and Gordon Clapp among the players, while John Mahoney is excellent as 'Kid' Gleason, the coach who believes the best but fears the worst for his tainted players. John Anderson's appearance as Judge Landis was the surprise of the film for me, it wouldn't be far from wrong to say he appeared in just about every classic TV Western series ever made.

Anyway, so is the folklore (Jackson said it never happened) or fact.  But even tho Jackson is the most romanticized figure associated with the scandal, the film does not particularly focus on him, because the story is about how the fix transpired and went into effect, and he was not a ringleader.  In fact, by many accounts, he was more innocent than generally depicted, including in this film.  At their most extreme, the accounts have him as innocent or even more innocent than third basemen Buck Weaver, the one of the eight who was banned by new Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis for, even while refusing to participate, merely knowing about the fix and not fessing up to the powers that be.  In fact, one account has Jackson trying to get into White Sox penny-pinching owner Charles Comiskey's office to alert him of the plot.Eight Men Out merely has Jackson as a passive, late acquiescer.  Organizer Chick Gandil, the Sox first baseman, and star pitcher Ed Cicotte, the most important person for on-the-field purposes, are the key figures, as in historical fact.  The balanced viewpoint is certainly intrinsic to this well-post-Ball-Four (should I also say post-Ken Burns?) movie, for Comiskey's cheapness is readily evident when the players have been expecting cash bonuses for winning the pennant and instead get bottles of champagne.  The film also makes it clear that Comiskey deliberately kept Cicotte out of the rotation toward the end of the season to keep him from earning a promised $10,000 bonus for winning 30 games (he ended up with 29).  Don't worry, Ed, there's always that extra World Series paycheck...The most prominent, and sympathetic, figure in the movie is none of these, however--it is in fact Weaver (played by John Cusack, and very well). Eight Men Out is a well-screened film, very well-paced, not self-absorbed or overly absorbed with any character.  The preliminaries set in, the fix is led by Arnold Rothstein, scenes of all eight games are shown (and I like that), then come the revelations, the courts, and Judge Landis.  But in between, Weaver is featured in many vignettes--with kids, his wife, others.  He is the dark horse, not a ringleader, of course, and not a name-recognitioner (like Jackson), just an interesting (and actually kind of wholesome) person.  He is very human, opposes the fix, wants to be an example to kids, loves baseball, sort of represents the baseball spirit.  Besides, Comiskey is such a creep; if you don't like the fix, why go to Comiskey either?  Weaver is an authentic tragic figure, and it is a thoughtful move to explore him here not merely as much, but clearly more, than Jackson, a more obvious choice on the surface.Those who did not participate in the fix are portrayed in different manners.  Hall of Fame second baseman Eddie Collins is the favored college boy, portrayed matter of factly.  Catcher Ray Schalk, who got into the Hall of Fame only for nonparticipation in the scandal (seriously--check his stats), confronts Cicotte as he begins to perceive his batterymate is not on the level and starts a fistfight with Lefty Williams, the Sox' second leading pitcher, on the same pretext.This is a fine baseball film, satisfying viewers' thirsts for a definitive cinematic account of one of baseball's most famous events.  Contrary to the references in the expected dramatic flourishes, however, this team was not, and was not seen, as the best team of all time up to that moment.Now let's get real and put Shoeless Joe in the Hall of Fame (and Pete Rose too).  It is what you do on the field that counts (besides, many actual Hall of Famers weren't angels), and Jackson decided to go ahead and hit .375 in this series anyway, so...

He has a way of putting a real human face to his characters so much that you really care for them and pull for them.   Eight Men Out is no exception. I found myself really pulling for Buck Weaver (John Cusak's character). His character has a real passion for the game of baseball . Unfortunately, the flame is extinguished by association with the players who are corrupt. I also felt compassion for DB Sweeney's character because his fellow team mates take advantage of him and he is roped into the scandal (Guilt by association).

It is good to know that these players were not anomalies in an otherwise clean world.  They are definitely products of their environment.The reason why I have not watched this movie more than a couple of times is because I always feel moved to sympathize with the players, almost to root for them, and yet I know the story ends badly for the players.In my opinion this is a good movie which also plays with our emotions just enough to be unsettling while not quite crossing the line.  It comes darn close, though.  It doesn't actually alter history that I'm aware of, but in one scene the easiest inference for the viewer to make does not quite square with the facts.  The same can also be said about the overall treatment of Joe Jackson's involvement or lack thereof.The problem, if there is one, with this movie, is that it is tempting to turn these 8 men into innocent victims.  It is not necessarily bad for a movie to lean in that direction, but it means we are responsible for the conclusions we draw, even when we are led to them.  Even the movie, assuming it is historically accurate, does not mitigate the fact that even Buck Weaver and Joe Jackson, if they did nothing else, still knew about the fix and did or said nothing about it.  That alone makes them guilty.  Weaver claims he never got paid.  Jackson didn't make such a claim - in the movie at least - but they both seemed to be expecting some form of payment.These 8 men were responsible for their own actions, and however corruptly Baseball handled the affair, no matter how unfairly justice was doled out, the fact is they were held responsible and were given a just punishment. They each lied or at least harbored the lie perpetrated on millions of baseball fans, namely that the game being played between the white lines was truly a competition between two teams when it really wasn't.Having said all that, I commend Sayles because his movie doesn't deny this reality.  He expresses his feelings through the script, and you can sense where his sympathies lie, but he still allows the viewer to form their own conclusion.

But what makes this movie truly memorable is that it is not just about the Black Sox scandal, it's about the more universal theme of the loss of innocence, a theme it deals with on multiple levels.The film starts by showing us a nostalgia tinted view of turn-of-the-century America. Life is good, prosperous, and simple. America's national past-time is a fulfilling part of all of our lives. This doesn't last, of course, as the game itself is corrupted by gamblers, greedy owners, and players who would take bribes to throw the game. But our loss of innocence doesn't stop there. The owners begin a series of manipulations which allow them to rewrite history to their own liking. The justice system is corrupted and all the players, even an innocent one, are banished to preserve the image desired by the owners. Buck Weaver has to sit and watch as America's memory makes him guilty; there's nothing he can do about it even though he may spend the rest of his life trying.History is the way things really happened; memory is the way we remember it. From the very beginning with its overly nostalgic stylizations, we realize that we are watching the presentation of memory. When the say it aint so scene is thrown in our face in intentionally awkward manner, the movie is dispensing with any pretenses otherwise. But at the same time it gives us many details and insights which are not part of the myth, and therefore can be assumed to reasonably accurate history. All of which makes us painfully aware that our own knowledge of the scandal, like most historical events, is as much myth as it is reality. And possibly one of the greatest losses of innocence is the realization that even our memories aren't safe at they are shaped and manipulated by forces over which we have no control.

For those of you that do have an affinity towards baseball's canon, this movie is an essential. John Sayles is the driving force behind this picture. He not only directs and adapts the story from Eliot Asinof's (who receives a cameo as Ban Johnson) book of the same name, but also brilliantly portrays eloquent sportswriter Ring Lardner. As for the story itself, it has become something of a myth to the baseball community. This cautionary tale illustrates one of the many harrowing hypocrisies in baseball's fledgling days in the national consciousness. The acting performances are consistent throughout the duration, an obvious credit to Sayles' passion for his subject. He intrinsically weaves myth and fact to create a stark view of the situation at hand as if it was being watched in film reels preceding a film, instead of being the film itself. In addition to the quality of the shooting off-the-field, the on-the-field portrayals are as realistic as have been in a baseball film. Another aspect worth mentioning is the performance of D.B. Sweeney as the immortal Shoeless Joe Jackson. This is a true rendition of Shoeless Joe, as opposed to the purposefully inaccurate displayal by Ray Liotta in Field of Dreams. Sweeney went as far as to learn to hit left handed, as Jackson did, as opposed to Liotta hitting right handed in Dreams. An interesting sidenote is that Sweeney didn't have much time to learn as he thought the technological tweakers could flip his hitting scenes, ala Gary Cooper in The Pride of the Yankees. Due to cost and time infractions this was not possible but Sweeney does a fine job of it. The musical score is also somewhat of a touchstone to one's opinion of the film. It can be seen as the essential character that it is, especially in the baseball action scenes. However, some may view it as overbearing and confrontational to the film's action. This seems to be the major separation between those who enjoyed this film, and those who spent their time dreaming of the thoughtless films they usually digest. I would like to say that I wished I could give this the exact grade I believe it so earnestly deserves, but the fact that too many would be turned off by the historical exactness challenges me to adjust my judgement.

Sayles' Weaver is portrayed as the victim of the ultimate betrayal for not participating in the scheme. His teammates don't back him up. The courts do not defend him. The press lumps him together with the guilty. His only crime was not being a snitch. And for that, Weaver has basically been relegated to baseball history's limbo, in spite of an above-par career.

Sure Babe Ruth was coming into his own by 1920, but most ballplayers in that era would not have place Ruth in the class of Cobb, Tris Speaker or Walter Johnson. For baseball fans, this line in particular really comes off as shallow, especially since the rest of the film really tries to capture the dead-ball era. For the most part though, this film feels and sounds a lot like America right after World War I ends, a fascinating time and place.Studs Terkel steals the show in my estimation. His character in the film is not far from whom he is in real life and his authenticity is undeniable. John Sayles is a little stiff by comparison and his singing in the railway car (which according to legend did actually happen), is rather difficult to bear. None the less, his direction makes up for his foibles as an actor.Straitharn is another gem in this movie, and once again this actor seems to get right to the soul of the characters he is given to play. Eddie Cicotte's dilemmas are written all over Straitharn's face in every scene, he's also given some of the best dialog in the film. Cusack plays his part well, despite the fact that many of his scenes are reduced to clichés. Cusack's best moments are when he is frustrated about his inclusion in the conspiracy trial, despite the fact he gave his all to try and win the series. His outbursts in the courtroom seem perfect, as if drawn from the trial transcripts themselves.Joe Jackson is given unfair treatment. If Field of Dreams mythologizes Jackson to point of hyperbole, Eight Men Out plays up his illiteracy with too much of a heavy hand. Joe Jackson wasn't stupid, indeed if you read his last major interview before he died, he speaks about the Black Sox with great alacrity and clarity. He was not as ignorant as this film would have you believe. One day someone will produce a film about Joe Jackson, that will portray him accurately, but Eight Men Out is not that film.Although their roles are very minor, Kid Gleason and Ray Schalk are really well played and written. These two went through a very difficult time during the series, and this is well demonstrated. One minor beef is that Nemo Leibold, Shano Collins and other players outside of the conspiracy are never touched upon at all. This is understandable to a degree given the relatively short length of the film, despite the complexity of the subject matter.The baseball scenes themselves are well done. The bats, balls, gloves and uniforms look like the equipment of that era and the ballparks are successful mock ups for the most part. There are even a couple of nifty athletic displays in the outfield that must have taken several takes to pull off.Eight Men Out isn't perfect, but it isn't as flawed as Roger Ebert would have you believe. If you a fan of baseball in fact, I'd say its mandatory viewing.

In the early 20th century, baseball players were barely payed enough money to live on, so when organized crime stepped in and offered a big pay day for throwing the 1919 World Series, half the team said yes. The film Eight Men Out is based on the book by Eliot Asinof, the first to officially tell the story of what happened. Until this book, people knew the outcome, but not the particulars. While the book goes into great detail, the movie does not. The film gives us the basics in a very simplistic form, in order to make it more dramatic, and that's the one part of this film I didn't really care for. The things I really wanted to know more about never seemed to materialize and a lot of what we saw in return was the Hollywood exaggeration effect. Don't get me wrong though, the film was very entertaining as it showed a lot of the action on the field and touched on some aspects of the scandal. The acting was stellar and it was really fun to see Charlie Sheen and John Cusack right as they were first starting out. As for the ending, well that was expected, but I still really enjoyed the sports action, back stories, and even the over the top dramatics surrounding the story. It may not be very in depth or even historically accurate, but seeing it again all these years later, I can now appreciate and understand why it is considered one of the top ten sports films of all time.

It contains memorable quotes* Mr. Rothstein says he's in.. - a grim messenger from the notorious A.R. announces this whilst dropping $80,000 on a table (consider how much that was in post-World War I America)* Nothing but fastballs. -- Slow Ones. - after an ace left-handed pitcher tanks another game, this time in the first inning* He'll never get work as an actor - Ring Lardner commenting on the laughable base-running by a player who is in on 'the fix'.The acting performances are splendid including great work by John Cusack, veteran supporting player John Mahoney, and David Strathairn, who will surely win an Oscar one day soon.Also, we could add (to the other fine remarks here at IMDb) that the soundtrack, costumes, dialogue, and camera angles are first class, giving the viewer a 'you are there' feel to the proceedings. You can read in the IMDb trivia that the Director had to coach the actors to talk fast so that the film would come in under 2 hours. This results in several snappy exchanges between the characters that resemble the dialogue heard in early black and white talkies, with words such as 'mugs', 'bushers', 'nickel-bets', 'shellacking' or 'squealer' - terms of the day. Speaking of music, we often hear very upbeat 'sassy' tunes, well-suited for the 'Jazz Age', while we read headlines or view a collage of photos. Another nifty way to unfold the plot, almost as if the music was telling the story.I have read Asimov's book, and watched the account in the Ken Burns 9 Innings of Baseball, which also gave an interesting narrative on this compelling, if tragic, incident. Babe Ruth emerged to restore public confidence in America's game in the 1920's. Sadly, in modern times, with a 'doping' scandal overshadowing the feats of certain great athletes, the Babe and Joltin Joe 'have left and gone away', leaving the public disheartened once again.- canuckteach 9/10 "},{"Title":"Famous and Infamous 1919 BLACK SOX SCANDAL Given  Life And Humanity By Film Maverick, Director John Sayles .","Date":"20 June 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, History, Sport","Review":" Big League Baseball, be it National League or Americn League. Just what is it? What makes us Watch it on TV, listen to its Radio Broadcasts, Pack the Ball Parks, Buy the Daily Paper just to read the Box Scores and Curse Out those damn, self-opinionated Sports Columnists! Well, if you'd have asked me, I think those Ball Players are nothing but a pack of Spoiled Brat, Over-paid Millionaires, who get the luxury of living the life of Riley, remaining Boys, all their lives (or at least until the end of their playing days), just Playing Ball! And, Oh Lord, how lucky can a guy be! Though the United States of America has no 'Offical' or State Religion*, for 6 months a year we do devoutly live and die with our team, whatever that team may be. In my own case, it is The Chicago White Sox, the subject of this little dissertation.While there is no doubt that the player of the World War I/Roaring 20's Era made no salaries that compared to their counterparts in this modern age of ours, we have to take all factors into consideration. They did far better than their every day, working stiffs counterparts. Most any Baseball guy made much more in his half year than any household did for a whole year.What kept the ball players in control was what was called the Reserve Clause. What it meant was that no matter how long a period of time a contract had in its duration, the management could keep a player as long as they pleased. The Reserve Clause was in essence a legal instrument designed to have this 'just one more year' automatic amendment on every contract. Of course, this was all subject to the whim of the Owners, who could unilaterally terminate the agreement.** So it is to this year of 1919 that Director Sayles brings us.It is the year after the 'War to end all Wars', The Great World War I was over. We observe the excitement of 2 brothers*** gleefully running through the streets of the Bridgeport Neighborhood on Chicago's South Side, the older brother having gotten enough money for the two of them to get bleacher tickets to the White Sox game. The bleacher tix cost $0.25 each, and it was made by hawking papers! We get the kids' view of this game and learn of even children have a little larceny in their hearts from a little con game they pull in order to get some candy money.The action soon moves around the Ball Park to the Press Box,to the Suite of Owner,Charles Comiskey(Clifton James) and finally to two Grifter Types in Sleepy Bill Burns(Christopher Lloyd) and Billy Maharg(Richard Edson)who are discussing which players would be willing participants in rigging the outcome of the upcoming World Series that The Sox would be in as winner of The American League Pennant.As the game progresses, the 2 conspirators evaluate players as they bat or make some defensive play. One by one the put them down for a 'yes', 'no' or a 'maybe'.Later all the team is gathered at some local Pub for celebrating their clinching the Amrican League Pennant. Here a Bostonian Gambler, Sport Sullivan ( Kevin Tighe)is busy bending the ear of Sox 1st Baseman('Chick' Gandill)about throwing the Series for money. Gandill is also pitched the same idea by Maharg and ex-pitcher Burns.So unbeknownst to each other, 2 different fixes are in, making it a double-bubble pay day to the 8 conspiring ballplayers. That is if everything goes as planned.Both 'Sport' Sullivan and the Burns/Maharg think of financing the operation with backing of The Big Guy of Gambling, New York Gambling Czar, Arnold Rothstein (Michael Learner).The story moves through one double cross after another and the extremes the Underworld would go trough to insure that the players see the fix to the end.The Book and Movie of EIGHT MEN OUT both take a sympathetic view of some of the players, like29 Game Winning Pitcher Eddie Cicotte(David Stratharin). But real Not Guilty verdicts are lobbied for 3rd Baseman 'Buck'Weaver(John Cusack) and especially Outfielder Shoeless Joe Jackson(D.B.Sweeney).The cast is superb and work together like a Theateratrical Reperatory Company. The only Actor,other than John Cusack, who can be called a Movie Starwould be Charlie Sheen, who works well with the rest,proving to be a real trooper.The others not yet mentioned but still worthy of mention are Don Harvey, Gordon Clapp,John Mahoney,James Read,Perry Lang,Jace Alexander,Bill Irwin and Michael Mantell. Special notice must be given for the performances given by John Anderson as Judge Kennisaw Mountain Landis, Director John Sayles as Ring Lardner and Chicago's own Rennaisance Man Studs Terkel as Chicago Herald-Examiner Sports Writer, Hugh Fullerton.Sayles took special care in creating a true period piece.The costuming, and the sets are near perfect, with parts of Indianapolis subbing for Chicago. Also the Old Ball Park made a good stand-in for Comiskey Park.This is one truly Underrated Film, of Chicasgo, of Baseball and of the Human Condition.* Someone once said that in order to understand Americans and their Country, they should learn Baeball. Motion Seconded!! ** Slavery & any other Involuntary Servitude was supposed to have been outlawed following our Civil War, yet it took until 1976 and civil litigation by people like Curt Flood and Andy Messersmith to include Baseball.*** Seeing these 2 kids running down the street in their rag-tag hand me downs makes me think of my own Uncle John R.Ryan(born 1913)and our Dad, Clem Ryan(born 1914)who were almost old enough to have been there at that time. They lived not far away (in the Canaryville neighborhood, just South of Bridgeport)and must have had a thousand stories about Sox Park-including Old Man Comiskey letting all the kids around the Ball Park into the Game after a few Innings!! "},{"Title":"Anything Can Happen In Baseball","Date":"12 March 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, History, Sport","Review":" Eight Men Out is a wry, vivid account of American life in a seemingly more innocent time, when men wore hats and ties when they went to the ballpark and kids said thank you to the ticket vendor. Yet all was not as it seemed. Something rotten was festering inside that most American of institutions, baseball.The film zeroes in on the real-life scandal of the 1919 World Series, when eight members of the Chicago White Sox, including Shoeless Joe Jackson, one of the greatest ever to play the game, accepted bribes from two different groups of gamblers to throw the championship. It is widely believed that baseball was in dire jeopardy after this scandal was uncovered in 1920, and only the emergence of Babe Ruth saved it.Director John Sayles platoons his team of established stars and journeymen actors nicely, getting the best out of all them. He also works from his own script which, at slight risk of caricature, showcases the slam-bang Damon Runyon/Ring Lardner patter of the time. Sayles even plays Lardner, a nice job augmented by the strong physical resemblance between the two.You say you can find seven men on the best club that ever took the field willin' to throw the World Series? gambler Sport Sullivan asks first baseman Chick Gandil. I find that hard to believe. You never played for Charlie Comiskey, Gandil replies.Gandil is played by Michael Rooker, who had one of the most menacing screen presences of the era. Sullivan is played by Kevin Tighe, best known at the time for playing a paramedic on the TV series Emergency in the early 1970s. Both are superb in their central roles. Tighe makes the Boston Irish Sullivan one of the film's most dastardly rogues, saying later as he withholds money from the players Ya know what you feed a dray horse in the morning if you want a day's work out a him? Just enough so he knows he's hungry. I also like the actor playing Comiskey, another '70s throwback named Clifton James who really rises to the occasion playing a villain as colorful and likable as some of the gamblers, refusing a $10,000 bonus to one of his players because he only won 29 games, not 30, while schmoozing reporters with drinks.You can go around the diamond and find a lot of terrific acting performances, terrific because the actors and Sayles have a great feeling for the individual parts and because the camera doesn't lean on them too long. Even actors I'm not usually fond of, like Christopher Lloyd and Gordon Clapp, shine brightly here because they do good work and don't carry too much of the production. Michael Mantell, an actor I sometimes see on Law & Order, gives maybe the film's best performance as a particularly unsavory character named Abe Attell, playing both the players and his boss, Arnold Rothstein, way past the point of no return.Of course, with Sayles at the helm, there's a lot of focus on the crimes of capitalism; how baseball, like other tools of the wealthy, serves to keep the lower classes down. Most of this comes with the subplot involving pitcher Eddie Cicotte (David Strathairn). At one point, as he walks along a street after being denied his bonus, we see him pass a pawnshop, then a butcher shop. He grips his own aching soupbone. In Sayles' view, the players had every right to rebel against their treatment by taking bribes, that the real offense in throwing the series was to themselves. Whether or not you agree with this premise, which to be fair is not beaten over your head, you have to admire Sayles' artistry in presenting it, and giving us a film of such broad sweep and depth it reminds you of a Robert Altman film with the added bonus of not everyone talking at once.

Even better than Field of Dreams in some aspects of historical significance, most notably, this is a true story. Eight men Out Stars Charlie Sheen in a role that brought him great fame, other than Platoon and Wall Street, which were both good in their own respect. But a sports drama-biography puts him where he should be in films, instead of romance. The story goes that just before the 1919 World Series, most of the Chicago White Sox agreed that they were not being paid enough, and were being exploited by the club owner. So, they took a Mafia bribe to throw the series to the Cincinnati Reds. Not a smart move, but it may have made them more famous than if they had won the series. After the series was over with the Reds, some accusations came up about Joe Jackson and his teammates, that they had taken money to throw the game. And ultimately, Jackson and his co-conspirators were thrown out of baseball for good, and never allowed into the Hall of Fame. To this day, Jackson is most famous for this stint in his career, which made him very famous, even spawning many books, and a few films. That is why I gave this film a 10 out of 10.

I do not agree with your criticism of the excessive length.  The fact that the movie shows the poor planning and uncertainty of the players to follow thru with the fix is shown in both the film and book.  The film shows the games that were thrown, the ballplayers getting stiffed by the gamblers (mainly Abe Attel) and changing their minds to try and win the series (at least some of them did) when they didn't get the promised 20 grand per player like each was originally promised.  Shortening the movie would leave out key parts from the true story and thankfully, this wasn't done. I think the actors do a real good job in the recreation of the baseball scenes and the middle of the movie which your critic bashes is unjustified.  The only part of the movie that could be improved is showing that the trial took place towards the end of the following season with the Black Sox only a game out of 1st and after Chick Gandel taking the lions share of the payoff money $35,000 out of a total of $80,000 and retiring from baseball.  The other players came back and the team was winning in spite of the ongoing investigation of the World Series scandal.  The book goes into this much more in detail but do include this in the movie would have lengthened it at least another 45 minutes.

Anyone who enjoyed John Sayles' film MATEWAN is sure to like this flick. It's difficult to understand why this film seems so unappreciated. It's got famous ball-players, a national scandal, organized crime, the mass media, courtroom drama, greed, hypocrisy and some wonderful performances by a capable cast. Throw in it's period detail and you've got the proverbial slice of pure Americana.As long as you detach yourself from our own time period in which athletes make obscene amounts of money it's easy to feel for the genuinely exploited White Sox players involved in the events. It's difficult not to laugh at the sense of national outrage that followed the revelation of the scandal considering how we've all gotten used to the fact that even our highest elected officials are hustlers and crooks who betray the public trust at every opportunity. It makes the throwing of a sports event seem very petty by comparison and adds to our sympathy for the players even as we disapprove of their actions. The naive way in which they figuratively bow their heads in shame and fade into oblivion stays with you. We all know that if this had happened in more recent decades the players would have all had their own first-hand accounts about the scandal on bookstands everywhere plus made-for-TV-movie deals, etc. The main flaw of the film may be the fact that it assumes the viewer knows more than they probably do about the events and the players. Many first-time viewers remark on being a bit confused about who's doing what and when if they watch the film cold without having read up on the scandal beforehand. I agree with them because if I hadn't been pretty familiar with the details of the story going in I'm not sure I could have followed it all that clearly at times. The film also fails to make clear the way that the reserve clause bound the players to Charles Commiskey's team indefinitely. The fact that the White Sox had won the 1917 World Series and yet it did nothing to improve the way Commiskey treated them should also have been worked in. Those are important details if we're to fully appreciate the players' frustration. A few moments of expository dialogue could have clarified all that for non-baseball historians. On the other hand, the film also neglects to cover the way some of the players involved in throwing the World Series were continuing to throw games during part of the 1920 regular season so maybe it all evens out. While the flaws of EIGHT MEN OUT prevent it from being a truly great film it's still very well-made and deserves at least one viewing.  "},{"Title":"Is that your wife?

This movie, Eight Men Out, fills in that void, the title referring to the 8 White Sox stars who accepted bribes to lose the 9-game world series in 1919 to the Cincinnati Redlegs. Even today you can find websites that seek to reinstate Joe Jackson's Hall of Fame elegibility.  But it probably will never happen, even though he says he didn't play below his standards during the series, he was certainly an accomplist by standing silently by as his teammates threw the series in eight games, 5 to 3.  His verbatim testimony, available on the internet, shows that he knowingly went along with the scam.some SPOILERS - do not read if you don't want to hear details, OK?This film is right at 2 hours long, but the only interesting parts are the first 20 minutes, where the series fix is orchestrated, and the last 25 minutes, where we see the jury finding them innocent, the immediate aftermath, and players like Joe Jackson being banned from the major leagues by new commissioner of baseball, Judge Landis who declared that anyone even being remotely involved with or knowing of a fix would be banned.  His position, an independent commissioner, with absolute power and a lifetime contract, was his conditions for taking the job, and vowing to clean up baseball.The middle hour and 10 minutes of the movie isn't particularly exciting, much of it recreating the 8 games played in the 1919 series. Some of it involving conversations among the baseball players, managers, the owner, and the crooks. The only reason the bribes were taken, the film suggests, is because owner Comisky was so stingy with his salary and bonus money, the disgruntled players felt they had additional compensation owed them, and this was a way to get it.  The whole film would be more interesting to me if the middle were cut severely and the movie edited to about 85 or 90 minutes.Still, it is an interesting and worthwhile film for any baseball fan, if only to be aware of this chapter in the Major Leagues. We forget easily, in 1919 there were no public address sound systems, the anthem had to be sung into a megaphone. Fans, or bettors, not at the park had to follow the game in an auditorium where tickertape feeds and a manual animation on a wall showed baserunners, outs, and scores.  The DVD is just OK, there are no extras except the theatrical trailer. Sound is 2-channel, many film imperfections are apparent.

It seems this drama gets pushed behind other baseball movies from this era. I love films like BULL DURHAM and MAJOR LEAGUE and while both of them are tremendously entertaining, in my estimation it's EIGHT MEN OUT that's the better movie. There's no doubt that it helps if you know about the real case but the perfection in this movie is so clear that it's impossible not to get caught up in the drama and tragedy of the events. I think Sayles did a remarkable job capturing the mood and spirit of the country during this era. The visual style of the film is something that really captures this but you've also got to give the set designers and costume designers a lot of credit. The look of the film really makes you feel as if you're back in 1919 and this really helps sell the story. I thought the screenplay was a major benefit as well because it seems that Sayles was interested in telling the story and not really playing favorites. The players are all shown as being guilty but it also shows them as being human in why they took the money. The film shows what a scam the trial was but it also shows that the children who looked up to these players were the real losers. It also doesn't hurt that you've got a tremendous cast bringing these characters to life. John Cusack, John Mahoney, Charlie Sheen, David Strathairn, Christopher Lloyd, D.B. Sweeney, Michael Rooker, Michael Lerner, Studs Terkel and Clifton James are all terrific and certainly deserve much credit. I've heard people complain that certain bits of the story were left out but obviously they couldn't put everything in a two hour movie. I've also heard negative reviews stating that the importance of Joe Jackson should have been given more of a spotlight but I thought the film made a wise choice in letting all stand as equals since they all went into this as one.

Every film brings something new to the table and Eight Men Out, is of course, no different. This is a solid film about the famous White Sox Scandal during the 1919 World Series. The acting is excellent and everywhere you look you will be sure to notice some famous actor whether it is Charlie Sheen, David Straithairn, Christopher Lloyd, John Mahoney, Michael Lerner and the especially great John Cusack (plus the many others I did not mention). But aside from the great casting, this film ventures much further past the point if the series was just a fix or not. We see the internal struggles of all the players, their intentions, their goals, their desires, and what each one wishes to pursue and how they go about it. The best example is David Straithairn (playing one of his most memorable roles, among many) when he says, We were crooked, crooked players as tears come to his eyes. And you can see that he was put between a rock and a hard place. He accepted the fix because he wasn't being paid enough, and the boss didn't provide any raises. So how else is he suppose to raise his rather young family? And then there is the great John Cusack playing Bucky Weaver. He plays because he loves the game and money isn't so much a greater desire in his life. He is the All-American Baseball Player all the kids in Chicago look up to. When the scandal comes around he wants nothing to do with it and instead just play to win. All other things aside, the most amazing part about Eight Men Out is the fact that it is an intense character study yet each character gets the same amount of screen time. So it is impossible for me to go over all the characters in a simple review. All-in-all, John Sayles' has proved his writing and directing capabilities, although being very subtle about it, he is one of the best in the business. Those of you who haven't ventured into his work must. He is simply one of the greatest directors and one of the most masterful writers.

This film was rather entertaining for a historical sports movie, though I basically knew how it was going to end. The story shows the White Sox at the beginning of the film clinching a berth in the World Series. A guy congratulates them and they proceed to ask about the bonus they were promised if they got to the series. Well apparently the owner of the Sox at the time was a tightwad and the only bonus they got was a few bottles of champagne. Well this gets a few of the players really angry, so angry in fact that they are willing to take money to throw the series and let Cincinati win it all. Very interesting movie, a good cast of characters in this one too. It even had John Mahoney who plays Fraiser's dad in it and he was great as he had nothing to do with the fix, but you could tell he knew something was up as his top pitchers seemed to be throwing like crap. The movie also says a lot about the time as who could really see any of today's major leaguers throwing a game for the scant amount of money the mob was going to give to the guys here. Seems sad in the end that the players involved, albeit underpaid, would rather be known as crooks and losers for a few extra dollars than be known as world champions.

This movie was about the 1919 Chicago White Sox and their scandal about throwing the game to get money. It is not just that they wanted to cheat; it is that their owner did not even pay them a living wage. This examples the injustice of migrant workers because they both are being taken down by whoever controls their pay check, and these people are bound to turn against them because they cannot take it anymore.The White Sox were offered a lot of money to throw the World Series, yet they did not do it because they completely just wanted to, they did it so they could put food on the table, or send their kids to college. It had to be done, just like strikes in the migrant world because they need more money to simply survive. This is the most common theme with the movie and the issue of migrant farm workers. People will go on strike, or not have an alliance to their owner or whoever they work for because they are not treated right and really sick of it.The most intriguing scene in this movie and the one that made the connection from it to the migrant farm worker issue was the scene when the owner promised a pitcher a ten thousand dollar bonus, yet didn't give it to him because of how cheap he is. This is what happened to the migrant farm workers when they asked for raises so they could put food on the table, yet the greed of the farm owners was too much to see the human dignity of a person who deserves it and works so hard for so little.This movie did well in fulfilling the purpose of its injustice teachings about the world. The main theme in it was if you are a business owner, and you get covered by your own greed, things will turn on you and you will have no one on your side, which is also what happened in the real migrant world. I think that it could have gotten the message across a little easier though, because at first it was hard to relate baseball with migrant farming. Ultimately it worked out because there were some good scenes that compared it perfectly.This was a great movie to learn about injustices of a living wage, and overall a great movie if you just want to catch a flick because it is really one of the great sports movies of all time. What is amazing about this movie though, is that it is true and all of the events that are seen in the movie are true also, which is completely mind blowing when thought about. This is a wonderful movie that should be seen by everybody because it has so much to offer as a good movie and a good lesson, and I am glad it is the one we picked for our topic.

The real story was that they got caught, since fixing is relatively common in all sports. The underpaid players were somewhat sympathetic, though it was made clear throughout the film that what they did was wrong.The cast blended together very well, and no individual performances stood out. A group of talented unknowns could have taken their place and you wouldn't have noticed the difference, but that appears to be exactly what the director was seeking.For a baseball movie, it was average, as in much better than The Natural or Field of Dreams, but nothing even close to Major League or even Mr. 3000 (for its younger audience). The cinematography was good, and the period was captured well enough for you to suspend the disbelief over time for the film.The DVD is worth having if there are children in the house who want to learn about this stain on baseball history.

"},{"Title":"88 Years Later Still Eight Men Out","Date":"26 September 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, History, Sport","Review":" In 1988 the movie Eight Men Out was released to the public. The movie tells the story of the 1919 Chicago White Sox who are better known as the Black Sox. The movie starts by showing the Chicago White Sox, who were easily the best team not only in the American League but both leagues. After winning the American League pennant, the cheap owner of the Chicago White Sox, Mr. Charles Comiskey, sends the team flat champaign to the locker room for a post game celebration. Mr. Comiskey was notorious for under paying his players and not keeping personal promises he made to many of them. By under paying his players, many of them looked else where for supplemental income from outside sources.The next step for the 1919 White Sox was to beat the Reds from Cincinnati. The Reds were a much lesser opponent than the heavily favored White Sox. Before the start of the World Series, Mr. Charles Comiskey made it publicly known that his White Sox would win the World Series. At the same time several big and well known gamblers were plotting a plan, for several White Sox players to lose the World series on purpose. The gamblers needed several key players to take part in the fix. They needed a key pitcher and several top hitters and fielders for the fix to work properly. The three main players the gamblers bought off were pitcher Eddie Cicotte, third basemen Buck Weaver, and outfielder Shoeless Joe Jackson. The White Sox do indeed lose the 1919 World Series to the Reds, but it is extremely difficult for anyone to prove that all of the so called fixers actually threw the World Series for money. Third baseman Buck Weaver denied taking any part of the fixing in a court of law. None of the players ever publicly talked about the fixing. This is why it makes it so hard to prove that they actually threw the World Series. The 1919 World Series was the first major sporting event after World War I, so all the owners thought the American public would enjoy the World Series more if they changed it from seven games to nine games. This idea was highly accepted by the money hunger Chicago White Sox owner, Mr. Charles Comiskey.For the most part all of the historical points match up with what actually happened in real life. The movie was actually shot at Bush Stadium, in Indianapolis. At that point in time gambling was widely practiced, but not completely accepted. Gambling was often practiced by many players and coaches, however, never to the level of actually throwing an entire World Series. The plot was very fitting for the movie. It is known that several of the White Sox players were offered money from an outside source before the start of the World Series, but it has never been proved that the players ever fixed any of the games during the 1919 World Series. The movie also points out many factual errors that did not actually occur in the real World Series. In the movie it shows several pitchers and hitters who threw and hit with a different hand than they actually did in real life. Also it shows Buck Weaver stating he hit .327 in the World Series, while actually he hit .324 in the 1919 World Series. The .327 was his lifetime World Series batting average. The rest of the errors were some what minor but they did happen.The only thing I did not like about the movie, was how it makes Shoeless Joe Jackson look like the bad guy. The man should have been allowed to continue playing the rest of his career. Jackson should be in the Hall of Fame; after all it's not all his fault that he could now read or write. All the man knew how to do was play baseball. Other than that, the movie is a must see for all baseball and sports fans. Eight Men Out tells the truth about the game of baseball at time of the setting. Eight Men Out is an instant classic, in which all fans of the game of baseball can relate to.

Basically, it tried to cover too much with too many characters-the players, the managers, the reporters, the fans, anyone connected, so that the film lost focus. Nobody is developed, and it takes a scorecard to figure out who is who and what is going on. We don't learn exactly what went on or why. Comiskey is depicted as a skinflint who had little regard for his team, but I read elsewhere that he wasn't as bad as the movie depicted. Shoeless Joe Jackson was depicted as clueless, and while he was illiterate (still not that rare in that era), that didn't make him incapable of knowing what was going on. Also, what motivated the corrupt baseball players other than greed? They weren't working for starvation wages.The movie neither works as drama or as a depiction of history. "},{"Title":"A detailed telling of a compelling story, but there's something missing","Date":"11 June 2010","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, History, Sport","Review":" Eight Men Out (John Sayles, 1988) is a meticulous reconstruction of the Black Sox scandal, which saw a gaggle of poorly-paid Chicago baseball players agree to throw the 1919 World Series for 10 grand a piece. Based on a 1963 novel, Sayles' straightforward, detailed telling focuses on Buck Weaver (John Cusack), pitcher Eddie Cicotte (David Strathairn) and the legendary Shoeless Joe Jackson (D.B. Sweeney, who is just superb). Though Weaver sat in on meetings between the conspirators, he never took a penny and was singled out in contemporary press reports as the White Sox's top performer during the series. Cicotte initially resisted organiser Chick Gandil's overtones, but ultimately buckled after he was denied a bonus by club owner Charles Comiskey. Jackson's role remains disputed, though historians tend to lean towards his innocence. The three were ultimately banned from baseball for life, along with five other players.We start with an uplifting opening sequence that sees the rampaging White Sox clinch the pennant. Superbly scored, shot and edited, with one particular high spot that sees Jackson thump a home run, the scene may just have got me interested in baseball. Returning to the club house, the players find a celebratory crate of wine and decide it's a good time to enquire about their long-promised bonus. You're looking at it, Comiskey's sidekick tells them. It's flat, naturally. With pay so low and their boss backtracking on his word, Sayles suggests, the players are plum pickings for unscrupulous gamblers, including Sleepy Bill Burns (Christopher Lloyd, who's distractingly artificial), Billy Maharg (Richard Edson) and Sport Sullivan (Kevin Tighe), all three ultimately backed by multi-millionaire gangster Arnold Rothstein (Michael Lerner). When the series starts, and the on-field fluffs keep coming, sportswriters Ring Lardner (Sayles himself) and Hugh Fullerton (Studs Terkel) smell a rat - and start digging.Sayles slightly contracts the timeframe for dramatic purposes - the incident with the wine happened after the team's 1917 series win, while the team played on into 1920 and the players' trial ended in 1921 - but shows an impressive fidelity to the bulk of the facts that extends to the locations of meetings. Where he falls short is in successfully elaborating on the motives of the crooked players, beyond the pay packet, which wasn't that substantial. Though Sayles shows Rothstein's exact movements during a matchday and Cicotte's aggressive pitch that signalled the fix was on, he skimps on the explanatory conversations that would have filled in various blanks and leaves out the odd telling detail, curiously neglecting to mention Cicotte's expensive new farm. Or Gandil's swift departure for California, with $35,000 in his pocket.It's difficult to fault the rendering of time and place and, at least to this unskilled eye, the restaging of the matches is extremely adept and exciting. Cusack's look of bewilderment, alienation and frustration on the field as he sees the team crumbling around him is moving and the scenes of the Sox briefly reneging on their pledges and going hell for leather are triumphant, but given the absolutely fascinating, highly emotive subject matter, Sayles doesn't really articulate the scale of human drama present, or provide the social and emotional context to make Eight Men Out a great, even definitive take on the scandal. That the gut-smacking sledgehammer to end them all, a young boy's tearful plea to his idol for some form of explanation (Say it ain't so, Joe) doesn't pack a wallop is a sign of the film's failings. Indeed, the film doesn't strike quite the right note until the devastating, bleached-out coda, which works extremely well and set the tone for the following year's Field of Dreams, another movie dealing with the Shoeless Joe legend. Eight Men Out is a highly engrossing, very well-acted movie, but given the writer-director and the entirely compelling topic, it doesn't quite hit the heights.

His direction is quite good at times, and the cinematography is exemplary, especially the lighting, but everything else is subpar. The script is rather poor. The film unfolds in three sequences 1) the setup, involving all the bets that are made and, of course, character introductions, 2) the World Series, and 3) the consequent scandal and trial. The first part is somewhat confusing, which is mainly due to the fact that the characters are so poorly developed. The players are introduced in a hackneyed sequence where the team owner lists them and their attributes, which plays over one of the team's last season games. Because of this, we only really get to know the majority of the players only peripherally. What is really disappointing is that most of the actors who play players are bad, even good actors. David Strathairn, an actor who only ever seems to appear in Sayles' films, is the only one who gives a good performance. John Cusack is bad in the first two acts, but has some good scenes in the third. Also, the crooks, those who arrange the fix and the bets, are especially poorly introduced. I recognized some of the actors from other Sayles films (the two strikebreakers from the excellent Matewan play two of the key gamblers), and other character actors from other films. None of them are good, though they all had been good (or would be good) in other films. The second act, the World Series, provides the best scenes in the film. However, well, if you're in my boat and don't really care for baseball in the first place, it gets boring. In fact, I don't even think baseball fans will like these scenes too much. There is too much editing, and not enough playing. I have a thought that if the film had been longer, expanded a bit, it would have worked better. The third act is okay, but feels anticlimactic after a semi-exciting second part. The last scene is especially tacky. 5/10.

Another bad decision on the director's part is acting in his own film. His sarcastic singing in the train scene is the low part of the movie. The part about the selection of Landis as baseball commissioner is a farce. Could have been a great period piece about the times and America's early infatuation with the pastime.

That was yesterday.","Date":"14 September 2004","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, History, Sport","Review":"  There will always be the question of importance between sports and money. Which is more important? Do today's players participate because they love the game, or is it because they are thrown millions of dollars to play? It is a question that will continue to be a part of our culture as long as million dollar contracts are signed. I couldn't help but think of this concept as I watched this film. In 1919 the players of a winning Chicago baseball team decided to throw in their chances of a World Series title just to earn some extra cash for their pockets. The results of this game lead to interrogations, an appointment of a baseball commissioner, and a decree that would punish these ball players for the rest of their lives. For those of us that were not around in 1919 to experience this event first hand, director John Sayles has decided to show us the events first hand through dry cinematography, horrific acting, and a drama that is lacking in &#133; well &#133; drama.One of my favorite John Sayles films is Sunshine State. In it, Sayles takes characters and gives them so much emotion and spirit that you are literally pulled off your couch and glued to the television for the entire two hours. I wish this were the case for Eight Men Out. Sadly, where this film lacks is confident actors and a intense and knowledgeable screenplay. You could tell from the beginning that this topic was a passion of Sayles, but that he also had trouble directing it. It didn't seem to move as smoothly as some of his other work. I think one of the main reasons is due to the players that are under his lead. These are not dramatic actors, but instead some of the 'hottest' talent that 1988 had to offer. I kept thinking that he was trying to compete with the 80s teen idols film that was released the same year called Young Guns. He wanted to have a film that brought those normally not interested in a film of this kind into the theater. Hey, it worked for me. John Cusack is not a dramatic character, while later in his career he reaches this level, at this point in his life he is still has that persona of a imaginative teen. This causes his 'big' dramatic scenes to seem less and less relevant when they are presented. Charlie Sheen's accent faded in and out throughout this entire film, while D.B. Sweeney couldn't shake the cliché ways of his character's lack of education. Instead of being dramatic, I found myself full of laughter. I needed stronger actors to pull this film from out of left field.Finally, for those seeking a gritty drama about the hardships of 'rigging' a game, do not look in this direction. This is not an Oliver Stone film, this is John Sayles, which means that he is incapable of pushing any buttons. There were so many directions and dark alleyways that he could have taken us with this film. I wanted to know more about how these eight men won the trial, I wanted to know more about the confessions, I wanted to know more about the industry, but nothing was handed to me. I just had to deal with ignorant characters that were about to get five years in prison for their crimes, and nobody was worried. It infuriated me when the ball players walked into the courtroom and it was nothing but a joke and media frenzy. It seemed like they didn't care about the trial at all, so which left me no choice but to not care either. I dislike sports films immensely, and this film is one of the reasons why!Grade * out of *****  "},{"Title":"Sayles Swings & Misses","Date":"16 February 2002","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, History, Sport","Review":"  John Sayles is one of my most favorite American writer-directors. His film editing, his script doctoring on other Hollwood scripts, his fiction, his acting - I admire them all, but this is one of his films that just doesn't work. MATEWAN, CITY OF HOPE and LONE STAR are American classics that I feel will be greatly revered in decades to come - but with what he accomplishes in those three films, he fails quite badly at wiith 8 MEN OUT. Normally, Sayles has no problem handling a large ensemble of characters, but by spreading the Black Sox scadal story over the players, the owners, the gamblers and the reporters - the film seems to not have any focus, any real point of view. The gamblers say this in one room, the players say this in another and then time for some more baseball playing. There isnt much depth here while in LONE STAR and the others, literally every character on screen has dimension and weight. That's not to say this film doesn't have it's moments a great cast of under-used actors like Michael Rooker, Don Harvey and D.B. Sweeney, plus solid work from Sayles veterans Straitharn and Gordon Clapp. It's nicely acted but the script needed a few more drafts. Sorry Sayles - one this one you're out at second! "}]
