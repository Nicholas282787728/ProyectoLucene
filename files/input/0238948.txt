There is no doubt Griffin and Jones are wonderful comedic actors...Jones' performance in Replacements is proof positive of his talent.  The problem most people have, though, is they can't see his ability clearly because of career moves he has taken.  In Double Take, though, both Jones and Griffin shine in two different comedic styles, both jaw dropping funny and incredibly illustrated.  I rented this movie solely to see Jones, and now I have a newfound respect for Griffin's ability, as well.

The trailers that I'd remembered seeing were pretty funny, but I'd assumed that those were the best parts of Double Take.  Anyway, I watched it nonetheless and didn't think it was half bad.  There were several parts not included in the trailer that were laugh-out-loud funny.  Some might be offended by the fact that Griffen's character is (in the filmic sense) a coon.  Although nowhere near as good a comedy as Blazing Saddles, it is comparable in certain aspects.  Double Take could be considered racist, but like Blazing Saddles, it uses racial stereotypes to emphasize the stupidity of their existence.  Here, instead of black vs. white, we see upper-class African-Americans ashamed of the Sambo stereotype, and thus not associating with other African-Americans with lower social status.  I'm not sure if this message was intentional in Double Take, but it was there nonetheless.  Orlando Jones had a pretty good performance and Griffen was a convincing character (some might say he was over-the-top, but again I'd say this was essential).  One problem was that the movie quite suddenly switched gears from a comedy to a somewhat serious action/suspense flick.  I felt the heavy emphasis upon the latter took away from its comic moral message and made the movie shallower.  So, it had potential.  They could have recruited a few more writers to add in funnier jokes.  All in all, a 6 out of 10.

While certainly not destined to become a film classic, the miscellaneous plot holes are CERTAINLY no worse than most Hollywood fare, and as an overall movie I think rates a whole lot better than a lot of what's cranked out these days (2006). I REALLY enjoyed this movie, as did most of the other people who I have persuaded to watch the DVD, which I purchased after seeing the movie in the theater. JOnes and Griffin are both in great form, with the edge definitely going to Griffin's thoroughly brilliant comedy throughout. A great buddy movie, with great performances and production values, thoroughly entertaining, and very, very, funny. If you don't mind a movie that's not too cerebral, doesn't take itself too seriously, and doesn't aspire to be anything more than a thoroughly enjoyable comedic romp (with more than a few twists and a fair amount of action along the way), then you'll appreciate this. I don't think Mr. Gallo was aiming for an Oscar with this one, but it was completely satisfying for what it was. Incidentally, the music score and soundtrack were also remarkable.

It has humor, action, a little drama, and with all those emus.horror (not to mention the freaky guy with the marble for an eye). Personally, even though the movie got confusing at times, I liked this movie (with the exception of the fact I went with a friend who laughed through just about the whole thing and made me miss ¼ of the dialogue). I guess being a younger person I caught a lot of the stuff that some adults just didn't get. In the end the whole movie made sense to me, to a lot of other people it didn't, it was just funny. Any ways, since this is a review it looks like I better summarize what the whole thing is about for youThe movie's main characters are two guys that are like night and day and pretty much seem to dislike each other through most of the movie. First there's Daryl Chase, played by Orlando Jones (yes, that's the guy in the 7-Up commercials, OMG, who will be playing a drag queen named Miss Coco in an upcoming movie!), the sophisticated `good-looking' (as you can see, that's not my personal opinion, I just picked it up from another review) Harvard graduate who is a New York investment banker. Second you have Freddy Tiffany, played by Eddie Griffin (he stars is Master P's `Foolish', yeah, you can call me a fool but you can't fool me. You know that song.maybe.), who is a fast-talking street hustler with a mess of hair and a gold chain and oh.how can we forget his dog Delores (played by Willow Stars). Like I said before, they have basically nothing in common. Well blah de blah (I can't tell you the whole thing) they meet each other under weird circumstances then Daryl finds himself is big trouble because he is framed for something and soon he and Freddy switch places and head off to the wonderful place called Mexico. Needless to say many weird and strange things happen on their way to Mexico and even when they get there. We even get to see a smelly emu ranch called `El Emu Ranch' which has a 20-foot emu structure. After all this happens you may be confused or this all might make total sense to you, it depends on you.Out of a 10 I give this movie a 9. It was confusing and will be confusing to many people which is why I took a point off because I personally found it VERY amusing. It's not every day you see a sophisticated, well educated guy using some type of ghetto voice shouting about how there's `no Schiltz malt 'licka', right? Or we can't forget the adorable and funny dog Delores who's right up there with the adorable dog from `As Good As It Gets' but I forgot that dog's name. Then there's all those funny lines which I won't share, you can find out for yourself, because most of them aren't in any of the previews. ANY WAYS, this pretty much concludes my review of `Double Take', I will end it with a somewhat simple question to you.WTF is a jive turkey?!

True, it wasn't better than any of those three, but man Griffin and Orlando are certainly a double act to look out for in the future. Hilarious situations complemented by high profile action and a neat (if sometimes confusing) plot help to buoy the movie along at a frantic pace. But it's the performances which are the real jewel in the crown and Griffin (last seen, if I remember correctly, in 'Deuce Bigelow') and Jones (wasn't he in Armageddon?) are REAL good together, so much so that I kept telling my wife Misty that they MUST have acted together before on TV or something because they really act well off each other.

If you like the humor of the classic 1987 movie Real Men movie with Ritter and Belushi and if you liked the comic attitude found in Blue Streak then this is definitely a movie you will like. With the two actors Orlando and Eddie not being known as an infamous comic duo I certainly would have thought after seeing this movie that they have done this together before. I found many possibly subtle parodic similarities to movies like The Silver Streak and Stir Crazy which although you might think im out of the ballpark on this one, I couldnt help but to laugh my butt off! The directing was professionally witty and the writing was smarter than most any movie that is currently available for rent. I can only say that there is a bright future not only for these actors in comedy roles and that I am astonished that this movie has been created out of a 1957 screenplay. It definitely has been perfectly formulated to work in the current setting in which it was portrayed. Bottom line is that I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a sleeper comedy mixed with some well thought up schemes. Maybe those of you who are fans of violent humor in the the british-heist movies such as Snatch and Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels will relate to the mixture of violence and comedy as well here. And I want to know if anyone else caught the clear irony between the pen scene in this movie and the pen scene in the movie Real Men. Tell me that wasnt inspired by a great movie! Watch this movie!

The acting could be more convincing but the story itself is not convincing so it's hard to condemn the film for that. You have to go into the plot with a willingness to suspend disbelief, but it doesn't fit into the same bracket as films like Joe Dirt as far as humor is concerned. Other than some potentially objectionable language I think this film is a great bet especially if you need a good laugh. It should also be noted that the people that I know personally who did not enjoy this film went into it with more serious expectations. It is important to realize before you watch that the plot does not center around the action so much as it does the humor. I have owned it since it came out and rarely do I enjoy a film more than twice but this is one I have watched twice a week on occasions when I have needed cheering up!

When he gets home he finds somebody dead and is framed for a killing. So he switches places with Freddie and has to get to Mexico to meet an FBI agent who'll protect him. That's as far as I go.

Whatever the genre of the movie he writes, crime, action, comedy, in most cases he masters making it through 2 guys, who their differences annoy each other, producing a running irony that proves nothing but the fact of the opposite attracts, or &#x96; most importantly &#x96; that 2 incomplete people separately may mean complete one together. (Wise Guys &#x96; 1986), (Midnight Run &#x96; 1988), (Trapped in Paradise &#x96; 1994) with a buddy divided into 2, (Bad Boys &#x96; 1995) which he wrote only its story, and (Double Take &#x96; 2001) are examples from (Gallo)'s career. According to that list it's clear that he loves the formula and he's good at it too.Although this round it sounds like a mix of (Midnight Run), with the insane talkative cop of (Bad Boys), let alone that there are many known-by-heart tricks (framing the good guy, chasing him, kidnapping the girl, dirty cops and the happy end), but eventually it managed to score high as original action comedy.The ironic differences between the 2 leads enjoyed me very, as one urbane sophisticated rich, and one vulgar wild street-hustler. The character of (Eddie Griffin) was fresh; it remained unpredictable in a lovely way. Switching characters was creative. And the dog touch was cute. The events were unpredictable too, especially the whole second act in the desert, and the couple of twists near the end. I liked moments like the dancing match between the 2 leads, and the last scene with the Bond's devise used wrongly. The action scenes have been done perfectly. The image was hot exactly like the pace. And it's wonderful to know that it's directed by the scriptwriter (Gallo) himself. It seems that he can be notable action director.I'm not fond of (Griffin), he's always loud with heavy profanity, and hence he made the matter of being undercover brother totally unconvincing (So how about turning into James Bond at the end as well ?!). Yet, I must admit, he &#x96; despite all of that &#x96; was relatively funny, and with vague, always surprising, character there was even more fun. I have always believed that (Orlando Jones) is whether underrated actor or the unluckiest of them all. He can play comedy, stealing the lights from everybody; as he did in (Evolution - 2001). And he can play the serious part, with mimicking its opposite finely, as in here. So why he isn't a star yet, cashing millions as Tom Cruse for low instance ?! It's your typical delicious sandwich, however from another restaurant. And the result is nearly the same ingredients, a bit different taste, with the same treat. Here's the professor of the course teaches us how to remake the same with new plot and different characters, and be fresh and entertaining; well, that's the craft's creativity. It just kills me that his next script, for the same formula, would be (The Whole Ten Yards &#x96; 2004), where he lost being entertaining rather bearable !

On the advice of the CIA, Daryl goes on the run to Mexico with Freddy in tow.If my plot summary sounds a little convoluted then maybe you should avoid this film because in the place of a plot, the film just keeps on switching around the characters. The plot twists and turns in a very unconvincing fashion and it is a major problem because it is practically impossible to actually care about simply because none of it actually makes any sense. So as far as plot logic goes this is a non-event and there are only a few redeeming factors that make it worth a look in you're in an undemanding mood. The main factor is the smart-mouthed comedy that is delivered with energy by the lead actors; it may not be that good but it has some funny scenes and the delivery makes it feel energetic even though you're not laughing that much. Jones is pretty good and makes fun of the ghetto clichés in one of the film's better scenes (ordered food on the train), but other than that he has the drier role of the two. Griffin is hardly a good actor and he squeezes every drop out of an average urban cliché and has the energy to cover for the weak material. I enjoyed his performance even though the script didn't give me much to laugh about.Outside of the scatter-mouth comedy, the film just piles in the usual eye candy to provide distraction if not actual entertainment. In line with the 'excesses over substance' approach of the script the film throws gorgeous black women at us like they were going out of fashion (and let me assure you that they are not). In the opening five minutes we have a party at an underwear show (for no real reason) at which we find that the beautiful Garcelle Beauvais is one of the main models and spends her first scenes in very little clothes. I have no problem with this whatsoever but I did feel bad for Beauvais &#150; NYPD Blue has shown me she is a good actress but this (and other films) generally use her for her body and nothing else. Likewise we have Eskra wheeled out and a mystifyingly small role for Vivica Fox that made me wonder why she bothered. On top of the sex appeal, the film throws on silly action scenes that are never really exciting but do manage to at least be noisy I suppose &#150; again, in the absence of actual substance, just make sure lots of stuff is going on!Overall this is not a terrible film, it is just not a good one. The plot tries to cover for itself by just having illogical twist after illogical twist to the point where I was beaten into submission and just decided to accept whatever it told me and try to let it wash over me! Outside of this, we have excesses thrown at us in the form of the energetic delivery that is never hilarious but does throw up the odd good moment while keeping the film moving; excesses of eye candy including Beauvais put in underwear and displayed for no other reason that to keep the male audience happy; and excesses in action, where gunplay is silly and lacking tension but perhaps befitting the rest of the film. Watchable and fun, if not actually that funny; but many viewers will not be able to enjoy a film that rides on energy and energy alone.

Then Daryl & his wife Chloe (Garcelle Beauvais) are attacked & saved from being killed by CIA agent Timothy McReady (Gary Grubbs) who says he will protect them, then the next day Daryl finds his assistant dead & in a shoot-out with the killers two NYPD cops are shot & killed for which Daryl is blamed. Daryl has to get out of New York & get to Mexico where McReady & his men are so Daryl swaps identity with a loud mouthed street hustler named Freddy Tiffany (Eddie Griffin) who now must work together to stay alive...Written & directed by George Gallo & based on the novel Across the Bridge by Graham Greene which had already been adapted into a feature film back in 1957 this buddy buddy comedy mismatched partner thriller didn't do anything for me but if you find the idea of two black dudes with opposing personalities arguing a lot funny then maybe Double Take is the film for you. What it boils down to is that I just found Double Take very unfunny, I could see what the script was trying to do & I can see where it was trying to be funny but I thought it pretty much sucked. For a start the Freddy Tiffany character is so annoying it's irritating, his loud mouthed outbursts, bizarre observations, silly clothes & the fact he turns out to be a top FBI agent is just ridiculous. Daryl Chase is more mild mannered & the whole mismatched partners who have to work together against some bad guy's has been done countless times before much more effectively than here, there's little to no believability to any of the character's & the silly slapstick comedy is not funny neither are cute little poodles that bite people. The thriller elements suck too, it's extremely predictable & the amount of pointless twist's it takes during the final twenty minutes is just unnecessary. At just over 80 odd minutes at least it's short & at least it moves along at a fair pace but I found it all very routine & very unfunny with little in the way of action or genuine laughs.As I just said the action is pathetic, there are a couple of dull shoot-outs, a predictable stand-off & a car is blown up but little else. With a PG rating there's no real profanity or violence so it's pretty tame stuff as well. Reasonably well shot Double Take looks alright but there's not much energy here. The script tries to have a stab at racism & elitism, from being treated differently because your black & because you wear an expensive suit Double Take plays on it for both laughs & as social commentary but pretty much fails to make much of an impact with it's messages.With a supposed budget of about $24,000,000 this was filmed in Los Angeles & New York, the one thing that could have saved this was a funny performance by the lead actor's but Orlando Jones seems bored while Eddie Griffin just seems like some buffoon who just happens to be a top FBI agent.Double Take is an unfunny mismatched partner crime comedy thriller that is strictly routine in every sense, a conveyor belt of clichés & ideas thrown together with little in the way of style or originality or humour.

Though he had a filthy mouth at times (thank you UPN) and he sometimes came across as a Stepin Fetchit, he could be really funny, especially when he was trying to come across as a Harvard graduate.I didn't care that much for Daryl Chase, but when he tried to act 'street' in a couple of scenes, he really nailed the role.There was a lot of excitement and some amazing plot twists, particularly close to the end (I did NOT see that one coming!). No one, and I mean no one, was to be trusted. I could have done without the violence.I liked the country music in a couple of locations when the characters were on the run, and the Mexican-sounding music (though not the beat that went with it).I do want to mention Edward Herrmann because I like him so much on 'Gilmore Girls'. In only one scene was he as good as Richard, showing confidence and poise. In the others, he just wasn't that good.The movie had its good moments, but it wasn't the best action movie by any means.

He would've made a great understudy for either Amos and Andy or Steppin and Fetchin.  Take your pick.  His performance was a send up of the typical minstrel characters from the 30's and 40's.  As bafoonish as he was in the movie, it's so incredibly hard to believe that his character is ***SPOILER*** actually some sort of FBI agent.  Orlando Jones was okay.  He has the potential for greatness, he just needs to be more wise in choosing roles.  But hey, for $500,000 I probably would've starred in this jackass of a movie too.

It's entertaining, as some of the plot twists had even a movie veteran such as myself confused at times.  Eddie Griffin is funny, but he doesn't sell as a sensitive caring undercover FBI agent.  Orlando Jones doesn't sell as the Uncle Tom type which is originally portrayed in the beginning on the movie.  He holds that persona for maybe the first 5 minutes of the movie, but it completely disappears after that.  It's not a non-stop laugh riot with no plot or acting, which is one would expect when they see Griffin and Jones are the stars, but it has its moments.  It won't win any awards, but I was not disappointed.  But it's genuinely entertaining although you won't be rolling around on the floor.

(anyway a very bad movie).There really is no way to descibe or spoil the movie because the plot is such a mess. For example here is a plot summary--> there is a good guy (Orlando Jones) and a bad guy (Eddie Griffin) who has a dog that hates the good guy, but then the good guy is framed (by apparently the bad guys using what is called a Double Take, but was he really framed by the good guys imitating the bad guys? So, then the bad guy (Griffin) changes places with the good guy (Jones). Only to have (Jones become a bad guy in another country where the now good-bad-guy (Griffin) killed a really bad guy and stole his dog for evidence (only no wait, he didn't really kill him either (probably another double take, i dont remember who really killed him, I think it was a bad guy).So then wait, Jones apparently had a child with someone so that they could pull a  double take on the real bad guys, only Griffin is still bad and the U.S. cops are bad, but the undercover cops are good, but the undercover mofia as undercover cops are bad, and eventually the head moffia boss guy is also good, but only until he is bad again.And then.....Well, if you made it this far and really want to know, watch the movie.It has a few nice points (mainly around a beginning that references The Godfather (look for oranges, which signify death). The bit about Slitz malt liquor is good too).But that is about it, a few good quotes does not a good movie make and Double Take gives you the fealing of, Heah, maybe I can throw a good idea (or a zillion) at you. One of them has got to stick.The problem is that with so many ideas and concepts and bads and goods, and mechanical pen gismos used to call in the national guard, Double Take ain't kepn it Real.

If you take jokes away from a comedy your left with nothing, no plot, no characters, no entertainment. Nothing. Do not watch this movie under any circumstances.

But this was one of those exceptions.  The trailers were pretty funny, and I figured if they were just a small segment of what the rest of the movie is like... it should be hilarious.  Well, I think they used the funniest parts of the movie to put in those trailers.  It seems like the movie is focused just as much on action and plot as it is humor (which I didn't really expect since the trailer portrayed it as mostly comedy).  The only problem with that is the movie is so complicated and twisted that I lost interest in its story early on.  The movie could have been redeemed if it had great action sequences.  But it doesn't.  The movie could have been redeemed if it were fall-on-the-floor funny.  But it isn't.The story is the number one problem.  There are too many twists and turns. In some movies that can add some suspense and mystery.  But in this movie, it just fails.  And I think it's because the movie tries to be too much. It tries too hard to be a great action film, a comedy, and a twisted mystery-esque flick (I'm not sure what you could call it).  Had it placed all its energy in one or even two of those... I think it could have been much better.And to top it off... I don't think there is much comedic chemistry between Jones and Griffin.  The trailers look promising in that area too, but again, the movie falls short.
