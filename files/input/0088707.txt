[{"Title":"It coulda been great!","Date":"14 August 2001","Score":"18 out of 27 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Sport","Review":"  This sentimental film which one reviewer terms a cult classic for cyclists... is disappointing.  Yes, as a former cyclist who was racing at a time long before cycling was popular, it does have some scenes that bring back memories of the adrenaline rush of riding in the pack (I was usually well at the rear) and the long hours of training.  The scene where they have to sprint past a pit bull is memorable too, but most cyclists can outsprint dogs.  However, when you compare this film to the 1979 Breaking Away, it doesn't stand up.  Frankly, I found the theme of an athlete with a potential life-threatening condition to be a bit over-wrought and excessive sentimental.  David Marshall Grant has his day in the sun alongside Costner and gives less than a memorable performance.  Rae Dawn Chong is, as always, charming but the rest of the cast fades away.  This is not a bad film and is one that could have been outstanding, with a bit of work.  It's too bad that Hollywood too often makes films based on sport stories which avail little about the sport itself. Indeed, their portrayal of the sport winds up being what they (Hollywood marketeers) think main stream America thinks the sport looks like. This film was made before cycling was brought into the public eye by such outstanding American athletes as Davis Phinney, Greg LeMond and Lance Armstrong.  My impression that the reviewer who chose to deem this film a cult classic for cyclists did so because there wasn't much else out there to fill that bill.

Take this sporting drama from John (WarGames) Badham, for instance. American Flyers is an enjoyable cycling drama from the pen of Steve Teisch, in which the gruelling hardships of professional cycle-racing is combined with a story about two brothers rediscovering each other. There's also a key plot point about a hereditary disease which may or may not affect one of the brothers. The story is never hugely engrossing, but it serves its purpose insofar that it gets the audience interested in the relationship between the two siblings, and provides a fairly exciting climax in which one of them has the chance to win a gruelling race.Lazy David Sommers (David Marshall Grant) lives in St. Louis and spends his days watching kung fu movies, dating girls, and riding his bike. His brother Marcus (Kevin Costner) is a more successful and motivated type, who works in a high-tech gym as a sports physician. The brothers lost their father to a hereditary illness, and Marcus is quite worried that David may have the same problem. Marcus persuades David to come into the gym and undergo some medical and physical tests. The results seem OK, and a relieved Marcus invites David to join him in competing in a gruelling bike race in the Rocky Mountains, aptly named Hell Of The West. The guys are joined by their respective girlfriends, in Marcus's case Sarah (Rae Dawn Chong) and in David's case Becky (Alexandra Paul). After a road trip to the Rockies, during which they bond quite closely, the Sommers brothers enter the cycle race. They're up against the likes of fiercely competitive Muzzin (Luca Bercovici) and Russian powerhouse Belov (John Garber). Then, halfway through the race, Marcus is unexpectedly struck by a haemorrhage &#150; it turns out that he, not David as originally feared, is the one who has inherited the illness that killed their father&#133;.Costner gives a perfectly likable performance in this movie, but it is actually Grant who has both the stronger role and the more interesting character. It seems very strange indeed that Grant never became a big name, and spent the rest of his career as a supporting player in largely forgotten films. On this evidence, he has the looks, the personality and the acting ability to have been more successful. The story moves at a decent pace, the first third dealing with the medical tests carried out on David, the second third showing their road trip to the big event, and the final third dealing with the race itself. The last section of the film is probably the best, with a genuinely absorbing race sequence that undeniably ends on a predictable note, but manages some real excitement along the way. The cycling footage seems quite well done too (I'm a non-cyclist, but it looks convincing to me). All in all, American Flyers is an enjoyable sports drama about a sport rarely touched upon in the movies. It's no classic, but it passes the time very pleasantly indeed.

I remember it from childhood, a favorite of my mother.This movie is a wonderful example of the Human Spirit despite adversity. David's brother Marcus visits home for the first time in years. Their father died of a brain aneurysm and Marcus was outraged at his mothers behavior during the time. David a bit more sympathetic to his mother knowing she just couldn't deal with it. It's on this visit that Mrs. Sommers expresses concerns that she thinks David has the same disease. Marcus takes David back to Madison, WI where he lives and works, to run some tests on him.Despite Marcus and David being on decent terms you can see a clashing of heads when it comes to certain issues, mostly from lack of understanding of one another. Marcus pushes David to try harder out of love, of course David doesn't see it as such. We find out that David is actually free of the disease that killed his father, however, an overheard conversation between Marcus and a friend at the testing center leads David to believe that he's a time bomb waiting to go off. He decides he can deal with death, and takes up Marcus' offer to do the Hell of the West cycling race with him in Colorado.Along the way David finds love, a courage and strength within himself he didn't know was there, and new understanding for his brother. It's the crashing news that Marcus is actually the one who's ill, and the disease begins kicking in during the cycling race that finally pushes David into being all he can be.A bit sad and intense at times it's still a terrific and inspiring movie to watch. It also gives a new outlook on the world of Bicycle racing that most people will never know or see first hand. I give it a 9/10.

Not just with those scenic mountain passes, but it also finally attains some of the emotional weight it's been dancing around all this time (which has been mostly McDonald's commercials and a soundtrack right out of a beer commercial).

Recently his father died of a brain aneurysm and his mother fears that David has inherited the same condition as her husband. One night David's brother, Marcus (Kevin Costner), comes over for a visit. Marcus is a seasoned cyclist who has competed in several big races. He is also a practicing doctor with a steady girlfriend named Sarah (Rae Dawn Chong). After a series of tests are performed by Marcus, David gets a clean bill of health, but when David overhears Marcus talking he believes he really is going to die. Little does David know that the one who is endangered of dying of a brain aneurysm is his brother Marcus. Marcus had intended to keep this piece of information a secret because he didn't want anything to stand in the way of the big race he had planned to enter with his younger brother. Only Sara and a trusted friend know he may die any day now. Soon Marcus, David and Sara are off to train on the way to Colorado. Along the way the trio finds their way to a fast food restaurant where David meets Becky (Alexandra Paul) awaiting her hamburger order. She agrees to join him on his journey and become a part of Team Sommers.Character DevelopmentBecause events are moving so quickly there most likely wouldn't be time for character development, yet some characters are noticeable changed to a degree. It is a little more than a crack of light, but it is there. One character that comes along is the mother, yet this character only has a bit part so the overall effect is marginal at best. David becomes a little more worldly and Marcus seems more grounded and at peace with himself. They are all layers of degrees.ActingThe acting was fairly solid with the lend actors and the surrounding cast, though there was one scene I found cringe-worthy every time I see it. Even though it is during an emotional moment I thought it was completely over the top. Thankfully the scene was short and there were no more scenes that display this similar type of awkwardness. The only other time where events reached near this point was at a dinner party that got out of hand, but I can forgive this because in comparison this was a slight imperfection. I think the lesson to be learned here is that oftentimes less is more because over acting is drawing too much attention to one performer and not letting the writing and the other actors pull their own weight.OverviewThis is an enjoyable film that I have seen a number of times. It has some nice shots early on during the opening and some outstanding ones during the big race. The producers really went all out with quite a few of them. I wouldn't be surprise to hear that riders were injured during the course of filming. Needless to say the Hell of the West, the race the staring leads entered onto definitely looked dangerous, living up to the hype that the movie was trying to sell the viewer on and then some.

The acting is first-rate. I can't understand reviews that claim otherwise. This is Costner, Rae Dawn Chong, and even John Amos in their prime. And the cinematography, with wide sweeping shots of the American southwest and pedal-to-pedal racing footage is no less than breathtaking. Any criticisms of this movie seem to be a criticism of the genre in which it was made. But all movies are made within a certain genre. Once you understand and accept the elements of a genre you can get down to enjoying a film for what it is. And for me, this film is a real treasure, one I come back to often.

And the Coors Classic was the best racing outside of Europe, with Team 7-eleven breaking into the continent. The Muzzin character with 7-11 was modeled directly after Alexi Grewal, who won gold in the 1984 Olympics and won the Bob Cook Memorial race up Mount Evans twice. He also had emotional/anger problems. The Soviet team was brought in after the cold war tensions and the Olympics, though they should have been a French team to make it accurate.You might even see a banner in the first stage south of Boulder with a Denver TV station logo and Coors Classic that didn't quite get hidden.A mushy movie, predictable turns, geographic mistakes in the footage, and some weak acting, but a good movie if you are in, or love, American road racing--and remember how it started in the Rockies.

It attempts to be both a drama and one of those inspirational sports movies that have been done to death.Right from the start, American Flyers is weak in its storytelling. There was some sort of family fallout regarding the death of the brothers' father. Marcus blames his mom for something or other and hasn't spoken to her or his little brother in a year and a half. The reasoning is never made very clear. Anyway, Marcus calls and lets his mom and brother know that he is coming for a visit. He shows up late for dinner and then announces he is already going home the very next morning. All the while, he is quite mean to his mom. Nice guy. It's made all the worse by not allowing us to get to know the mom at all. She is one dimensional and hardly has any dialogue.The story has two main topics. The father died of a cerebral aneurysm and the viewer is left wondering if one or both of the brothers is going to suffer the same fate. The film is also about a bicycle race. I would go more into detail but you can guess what is going to happen right from the start. There is no suspense whatsoever.Throw in what amounts to a McDonald's commercial part way through the movie and you have a real dud. Rae Dawn Chong and Alexandra Paul also star as the brothers' girlfriends. Both give decent performances but it's all for nothing.

It's one of those kinds of adventure dramas with plenty of heart, sincerity, and tenderness, maybe a bit too feel good for some. The story is ultimately about brotherly love and even develops a romance with a hitchhiking traveler trekking cross country(an adorable Alexandra Paul) and Grant. Ray Dawn Chong is Costner's love interest who drives the team van, assisting them when they need repairs. Costner is really good as the big brother who has been keeping a secret from his sibling and has reasons for motivating him to join him in the Colorado race. Not only is the cast irresistible, but the race is quite thrilling and compelling, albeit predictable in the ROCKY/KARATE KID tradition. A real winner, I believe, with a satisfying conclusion containing a great message about perseverance against multiple obstacles. I have always been partial to bike race movies(or stunt bike movies)and believe this would be an ideal pairing with BREAKING AWAY. Luca Bercovici is the Brother Sommers' nemesis, Muzzin(nicknamed the Cannibal), once married to Chong's character. Paul and Grant have wonderful chemistry on screen and the love Costner and Chong share is quite genuine and heart-felt. I really think the film hums nicely when the Sommers ride together where you can see the joy visible on both of their faces. John Amos, as Costner's business partner operating a fitness gym, is wonderful. Paul really shines here, her engaging smile and exuberant personality really won me over.

Remember when his excitement and energy woke you up? SILVERADO and BULL DURHAM, and this film, comes to mind, when the man had charisma. Something happened after his entertaining yet totally overrated DANCES WITH WOLVES (GOODFELLAS was robbed). Kevin gained weight and he became mellow thereafter. In every movie he seemed bored and tired and sluggish to me. Wisened or something. In TIN CUP he regains some of his earlier charm, but this is a review of American FLYERS. A feel-good movie, this film centers on a kid named David, who is a college aged slacker. But is he a slacker? He exercises a lot, that's for sure. But no matter, he has no purpose in life other than lying around dating models (who are trying to impress his casting agent mom) and watching KUNG FU (if you ask me his life was JUST FINE). Then Costner, his older brother with a fine mustache and a fine girlfriend (played by Rae Dawn Chong), comes in and takes him to a big bike race. I'm skipping a lot of stuff here, the main plot being about a certain illness that runs in the family. This is done nicely, and doesn't get in the way of the humor and action of the film, in fact it compliments it. Even a side story with John Amos and his overweight son helps things along. But all in all this movie runs smoothly. The only cast member who bugged me was Alexandra Paul, as David's hippie girlfriend. She was annoying and tried way too hard to steal scenes, in my opinion. But the rest of the film is quite entertaining, and in the vein of ROCKY and THE KARATE KID, this movie will make you guilty that you don't exercise, and if you do, that you don't do it enough.

There was a cycle (pun intended) of '80's films involving young men overcoming the odds to win the big basketball/hockey/rowing competition and this one features cycling.  With electronica music blaring, Grant (in a truly bizarre opening) zips through town on his tenspeed wearing a cowboy hat, a pair of clingy bike shorts and a denim jacket with nothing underneath.  Surreal comic moments include trying to escape the splash of passing trucks over a puddle and outrunning an old lady on a bicycle.  In an inane scene, he gets off his bike and rides the elevator up to his apartment only to remount and RIDE the bike to his door, complete with his shoes strapped in the pedals!!  This is all just a lame plot device to ensure he won't be able to get to the phone in time.  In an even more bizarre twist, it turns out he's straight!  A former female sex partner of his sends him semi-nude photos of herself in a bid to win the services of his mother--a modeling agent.  He shows what he thinks of the photos by stripping down and sitting his bare *ss on one.  He doesn't seem to notice when it becomes stuck there on his way to the shower.  (I'm not making this up!)  From here, there are all sorts of family tensions as his mother (Rule) reunites with his older brother (Costner) after estrangement and the two brothers attempt to get to know one another again.  Only, the same condition that caused the father's death is hovering over Grant as well.  The brothers decide to take on a grueling bike marathon called Hell of the Desert in order to share one last moment of glory.  The film is equal parts trite, contrived, silly, senseless, maudlin, quirky, intriguing and winning.  Somehow, all the disparate and sometimes ridiculous elements come together to create a sweet, enjoyable to watch movie.  Costner (in a scary mustache) does pretty well throughout.  His monotone voice only slightly mars the proceedings.  Grant is fresh and attractive and does well in his role.  Rule (an actress of great presence in previous roles) isn't given a lot to do, but does well enough.  Chong is exceedingly appealing as Costner's part-Apache (???) girlfriend.  Paul, an excruciating actress, has a ludicrous and annoying part as a hitchhiker who joins the group and instantaneously becomes emotionally attached to all of them.  She's there to prove that Grant is straight, yet even she has to ask him(!)  Needless screen time is wasted on her and on the relationship between Amos (a sports medicine professional) and his overweight son.  The best elements of the film concern the somewhat predictable, yet still exciting bike race which becomes a sort of mini-Ben Hur on two wheels near the end.  McDonald's employees may get a kick out of seeing what their forefathers had to wear in the '80's.  Also, a pre-Dirty Dancing Grey turns up in a small, odd role as one of Grant's blind dates.  While not perfect, the film is a product of it's time and is entertaining on that level, mostly due to an unforeseen plot twist near the end.

Didn't anyone get it back then? I mean, no scenes of a tight peleton or any drafting. Folks taking flyers off the front with no coordinated breaks and no teamwork to speak of. Absolutely no depiction of legitimate racing tactics, no blocking, no pacelines, etc.But the real corker was the dialog. I mean, why pay rental bucks on this one (or even TIVO it on cable) just to watch over-the-top product placement. For example, the guy gets seduced by the girl who attributes their meeting to the fact that she had to wait for a quarter pounder at Mickey D's? C'mon.How could Rick Denman (of Bikes, Camera, Action, who did the racing shots in Kansas) get sucked in so bad? Hollywood infects everyone! This one's off the back and dropped like a bad habit.

Personally, I like bicycle races, it's more or less part of popular culture in my country (Belgium). So I do like the subject but the movie gives me the feeling they aren't focusing on the same sport I adore so much. The reason is not that it's an American race, those have existed as long as the races in Europe. The US even were one of the first countries that joined the UCI (World Cycling Organization, for the smart asses UCI is it's French name). Many immigrants imported their local cycling races to the States where they were popular among the working classes (as in Europe). So I don't accuse the US of not having a cycling past, they just focussed their attention more towards basketball, baseball, American football and athletics.It just doesn't seem like cycling because the cyclists never gain a certain form or rhythm of competition. They just practice individually and perform good at those couple of races. But that's not reality. Lance Armstrong for instance races in many races for months to gain a certain rhythm that's good enough to win the Tour de France again. Off course, that would have made the movie dull and leaves less place for the Hollywood drama or the competition between the Americans and Soviets. But I liked the little part they offered the greatest cyclist ever, Eddy Merckx who won almost every big race in his career (only Paris-Tours he was unable to win).I don't know why this movie was made. It more or less makes me think of Victory (Escape to Victory) where PoW's offer to play a football (soccer) match against a German team and escape during half time. Hollywood tries to use sports very popular in (some parts of) Europe but not in the States. Why? Profit? To promote these sports in the US? Both?

Why can't Hollywood make an honest movie about a sport? I think if they would be honest, they would find that people would not be bored (like I was in this one), but more interested in the subject. Costner makes it watchable, but what's with all the hair. Beards, mustaches, etc, I thought being covered in hair was a 70's thing not an 80's thing. They could have left out the disease thingy, people who cycle don't ride around wondering when their head is going to blow up. Where did they come up with that? I suspect this movie ended many careers, and I'm surprised that it didn't bring down Costner with the others. If you are a cyclist you might want to watch it for laughs.

You may just get a taste of it in this classic Costner film (yes, classic, forget the purist nay-sayers).Before Water World, Dances With Wolves,For Love Of The Game and Message In A Bottle, there was AMERICAN FLYERS. You can guage (or wager) the distance in time, maturity or credibility of Costner's films any way you want, but this little gem will not disappoint you in subject-matter interest. Let's skip all that and get to the point this is a movie-goer's film.You don't have to be Fausto Coppi, Louison Bobet, Jacques Anquetil, Eddie Merckx (in the film), Laurent Fignon, Bernard Hinault, Greg Lemond or even Lance Armstrong to appreciate the deep rigors of bicycle-racing in this wonderfully entertaining 1985 Steve Tesich effort. It brims with interest on several levels. Throw out the 'corny' phrases if you want, even the obligatory and patriotic PG sex scenes with David Grant and Alexandra Paul with all the phallic symbols attached - even then, I enjoyed 'em, don't care what you say.Though the film is powerfully underscored by hard-core bicycle racing (this one is way more technical than Breaking Away), it's basically about competition, strategy, the preparation thereof and the humanity involved in it's surrounding cornucopia of personal involvements; the trainers, the girlfriends, the family, a twisty tragedy&#133;and the competitors, mostly embodied by the very diverse actor, director, writer and Ted Danson be-alike, Luca Bercovici &#150; well cast.RES FIRMA NITESCERE NESCIT &#150; a firm resolve never weakens, or in the film, Once you've got it up, keep it up boldly emprinted on the front of David Marshall Grant's new t-shirt, once he best's his brother's (Costner) clinical and physically-challenging endurance test at the Wisconsin sports training complex (administered by the much-underrated John Amos) &#150; will definitely make you either shrivel from the exhaustion of all-out effort or totally embrace it as a sportsman/woman. For me, from birth, recipient of 'bi-lateral dysplasia' (hips out of joint &#150; corrected by bloodless surgery via casts from Shriner's Children's Hospital), the film Sirened me off the couch in my 12 year old, listless, childless marriage and challenged me to prove I could be once again - this time on a legitimate racing bicycle - somehow, the athlete in my decrepit and lethargic '40s' that I was in high school as a record-setting swimmer in my late 'teens. It worked. Twenty years after the film's debut, I still owe K.C. for the life-saving change. Not only is the film workable but my life as well, thanks to that happen-stance viewing. You may want to give it a try yourself. Bicycling or not, you'll truly enjoy this 20-year-old sports-classic, family movie.9 for entertainment...

But every time I watch the scene where Sarah wakes up the morning of the second race and is trying to convice Marcus to come back to bed instead of going out with David to go over the course, she sees the sun rising with him standing there in the light of the new day and she suddenly realizes that what happened the night before when he had that dizzy spell probably means she's about to lose him.  She grabs him and kisses him and with big tears in her eyes says, Marcus I love you so much.  I just about come unglued.Some of the characters needed to be developed more though.  Luca Bercovici's Muzzin is totally hot, but his relationship with Sarah could've used more elaboration.  Marcus' problems with his mother could've been used to better effect if they had given her more dialogue to offer her side of the story. And why did Becky get so torn up when Marcus started bleeding from his anyeurism?  How long had she known these people anyway, two days?!That aside, the action moves along at a nice clip so you don't get bored. And there's no way you can watch this film and not find yourself rooting for David to burn Muzzin's a** in the race.All the way around a great chick flick, and pretty good movie for everyone else.
