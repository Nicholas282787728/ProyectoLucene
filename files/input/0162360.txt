Shot in just 29 days on a shoestring budget, this film's acting, directing, script and comedic timing are so clever and incisive that it has attracted an almost cult following, especially among Steve Zahn fans.There are plots within plots that all pull together in the end to make a perfect film. Starting with escaped convicts (Wayne Wayne Wayne played by Steve Zahn and Harry Sawyer played by Jeremy Northam) who have to hide and steal an RV belonging to two gay pageant designers, to discovering the gay lifestyle in a small Texas community (Happy), to finding love in the arms of a doe-eyed banker (Ally Walker ...sorry for the cliché, but she really does have doe-eyes), this movie hits on all aspects of life and puts a hilarious spin on them.The greatest things about this film were Steve Zahn's acting while trying to teach pre-teen girls how to dance, and William H. Macy's stunning performance as Happy's town sheriff who comes out of the closet.Always sharp, incredibly funny, superbly paced, this movie's small budget belies its excellent acting and directing.Few films will tickle your funny bone as perfectly as HAPPY Texas. Watch it. Buy it. Live it! "},{"Title":"Happy, Texas?

They make it to the small town of Happy, Texas where they discover that the gay beauty pageant experts everyone is waiting for, won't be coming after all. Figuring that they can hide in plain site with the right credentials, the duo steps into the world of little-girl beauty contests. Northam takes care of the behind the scenes activities while Zahn must teach the little gals their big dance number. Their methods are, to say the least, a bit unorthodox but the town embraces them mightily. However, posing as gay advisers has its disadvantages when the town's banker and the pageant assistant are both lovely ladies. How long will the convicts be able to keep up with appearances? This film is a darling and humorous gem. Zahn and Ilieana Douglas, especially, give all-out hilarious turns as the pageant advisers. Northam, a distinguished Brit in real life, charms the audience with his great looks and his commitment to his role as a screw-up from Texas. Ally Walker and William H. Macy, as well as the rest of the great cast, support the principals nicely. The small town Texas setting, the clever script, and the fun costumes complete one's fondest desires. Even if you've never heard of this film, don't pass it by. Although its gay undertones may be offensive to a few, its gleeful mirth and constant giggle-getting scenes mean a good time will be had by all who watch the film.

A comedy of incidents and errors, it illustrates what can happen when trust is placed in the wrong quarter; and interestingly enough, the good things just may outweigh the bad, depending upon which side of whose fence you're standing on at the time.  One thing is certain, before it's all over there are those who will know a lot more about themselves, as well as some of the others in town, and one way or another Illsley makes sure that there's plenty of laughs in it for his audience along the way.Harry Sawyer (Jeremy Northam) and Wayne Wayne Jr. (Steve Zahn) escape from a Texas chain gang along with killer Bob Maslow (M.C. Gainey), to whom they just happen to be shackled.  When Maslow takes it on the lam, Harry and Wayne steal an RV that belongs to a couple of gay entrepreneurs, David (Tim Bagley) and Steven (Michael Hitchcock), who are en route to Happy to produce a beauty pageant.  For personal reasons, the couple do not report the theft of their vehicle.  Meanwhile, as this pageant is a big event in Happy, the local sheriff, Chappy Dent (William H. Macy), is on the lookout for David and Steven, and when he spots their RV, he personally escorts them into town, where Harry and Wayne (who quickly catch on and become `Steven and David') are welcomed and handed some money.  It doesn't seem like a bad gig considering the alternatives, so they take the money and go along; after all, how hard can producing a beauty pageant be?  Suffice to say, being perceived as `gay' is going to be the least of their problems over the next few days.  And with that, the merriment begins.Humor is the main course served up by Illsley in this rather off-beat and quirky feast of funniness, which often takes the road less traveled to come out a winner.  It's a comedy with a twist rarely associated with the prevailing attitudes among the folks residing in the good state of Texas, wherein `macho' holds sway and those who wear a badge must necessarily conform to the shadow cast in the image of no less than John Wayne.  With Illsley's offering, however, we get to see the other side of the coin, and it's refreshing, as well as funny.  In the end we realize that `nature' will have it's way in every conceivable way, shape and form, and there's no getting around it; it's a little thing called `life.'  Illsley, though, is not attempting to make a statement with his film, or even send a message of any kind.  This is first and foremost a comedy; Illsley's intent is clearly to entertain and to make his audience laugh, and in this he succeeds.  He begins with an interesting concept, builds a good story and populates it with some bona fide `characters,' brought to life by a solid cast of talented actors.William H. Macy just may be the best character actor alive, and his portrayal of Chappy helps to make the case even stronger.  His resume reads like a who's who of a cross section of the earth's population  From his memorable turn as Jerry, in `Fargo,' to `Mystery Men's' Shoveler, Walt the director in `State and Main,' Lawrence in `Focus' to his poignant and unforgettable performance as Bill  in `Door To Door' and everything in-between, Macy makes whatever character he's playing unique, perfect and interesting.  He's a star who can carry a film on his own, or give the kind of support in a smaller role that elevates whatever project he's working on to a higher level; and there are very few actors around who can lay claim to that kind of range and success.  As he does with Chappy, he has the ability to make his characters convincing and entirely real, bringing them to life without any discernible trace of Macy the actor to be found.  Chappy Dent, for example, is a sheriff in Happy, Texas, with no connection whatsoever to a guy named William H. Macy.  It's the highest compliment one can pay an actor, and Macy deserves it tenfold.In the realm of character actors, it must be noted, too, that Steve Zahn is well on his way to establishing himself among the best of the best.  Like Macy's Chappy, in Wayne Wayne, Zahn creates a character with a decidedly unique perspective on the world and his own place in it.  And, like Macy, Zahn has the ability to disappear into a role.  Consider some of his characters, from Lenny in `That Thing You Do,' to George in `You've Got Mail,' Fuller in `Joy Ride,' to his role here of Wayne, and you would be hard put to find any semblance of the `real' Steve Zahn.  He has yet to establish his ability to carry a film on his own, but he has certainly demonstrated how invaluable his presence can be to any film. Of the entire cast, in fact, it is leading man Jeremy Northam, known predominately for period piece dramas (Mr. Knightly, `Emma,' Sir Robert, `An Ideal Husband' and Ash, `Possession,' for example), who seems to be the fish out of water here.  As Harry/Steven, however, he rises to the occasion and gives a convincing performance that is yet another `plus' to the film.  it's a role somewhat against type for him, but he pulls it off nicely.The supporting cast includes Ally Walker (Josephine), Illeana Douglas (Doreen), Ron Perlman (Marshal Nalhober), Jillian Berard (Maddie) and Paul Dooley (The Judge).  A feel-good film made for fun and frolic, `Happy, Texas' may take a side door to the humor, but it finds it and makes good on the promise of what `comedy' is all about  Plenty of laughs.  8/10.

Wayne becomes known as David, and Harry becomes known as Steven. Steven works on trying to avoid his feelings for the banker Joe (Ally Walker) and pity-dating the town sheriff Chappy (William H.

It could be because it's a low budget piece which never made it to the cinema and if it did it was for one week, or it could be because of something else. I'm not sure why I'd never heard of this film until it was on television tonight, but what I am sure of is that it's quite good.In Happy, Texas we're presented to the not so original chain gang jailbreak. Two of the three escapees are Wayne Wayne Wayne Jnr (played in usual standard by Steve Zahn) and Harry Sawyer (Jeremy Northam in an unusual comedy role). These two men steal a homosexual couples portable home and eventually end up impersonating the couple in a small town called Happy in Texas. The men are faced with the problems of keeping people believing in them, dealing with their roles as organisers of a young girls beauty pagent, and avoiding falling in love with some of the women townsfolk.This film is as to be expected really. In Zahn it has a daft, excentric appeal to it, whilst Northam is also good as the more serious partner who falls for the bank owner. Added to these an outstanding, if light hearted, performance by William H Macy as the closet homosexual Sheriff who falls for Northam and we're presented with a happy comedy which might not win any awards, but is going to make you feel good about yourself. Happy is a place named for a purpose. If you watch Happy, Texas, you might not laugh too often, but you'll certainly come away feeling good to be alive. One to watch when you need cheering up.

It IS possible to have a funny gay character without being flamboyant.  Sure, there is a lesson to be learned as in most films, but we care about these characters as they get deeper and deeper into trouble.

Steve Zahn is wonderful as Wayne Wayne Wayne, Jr., a pugnacious car thief with a real way with people who finds an unexpected connection with uptight school teacher Illeana Douglas.  As his partner Harry Sawyer, Jeremy Northam gives a flawless performance as a con man with a conscience who falls for the town's banker, beautifully played by Ally Walker. Bill Macy rounds out the cast as Sheriff Chappy Dent, who proves that life is for findin' out.There are plenty of scenes in Happy, Texas that are laugh out loud funny, but some of the best are those that reveal the growth of the characters as they come to know one another.  The dance scene with Jeremy Northam and Bill Macy is a perfect moment a slice of well-timed physical comedy (I'm gonna spin ya again!), but also a window into the development of Northam's character as he comes to know and respect Macy's.The chemistry between all of the actors is right on the money as well. Each of these characters was alone until Harry and Wayne came to town. When thrown together in the days before the Little Miss Fresh Squeezed Talent Competition, they find romance in the unknown, taking a chance with a stranger and finding it to be worth the risk.This film is that rare find a funny, genuinely sweet comedy that dares not to have a dark side. First time movie-makers Mark Illsley and Ed Stone made an independent film on a shoe-string budget that outclasses most films made by major studios.

Sniff-sniff&#133;I smell another rehash of a plot older than time itself.Happy, Texas is about two small-time crooks who masquerade as gay men to put on a `pageant' featuring little girls in a place called, improbably, Happy, Texas.  Just why the town should spring for such an endeavor is never explained, and the end result is a `pageant' that only the parents of the girls would want to watch.  I guess a bunch of little girls who sing off key and can barely walk, let alone dance, must be a source of civic pride somewhere in the United States.  Typical of Hollywood films, there's at least one child who speaks like an adult and can throw a mean punch like a fifty-year old drunk, dropping a man ten times her weight (if you're a budding screenwriter, for God's sake please PLEASE don't ever write a character like this).  There's also a masculine and forthright woman named `Joe' who runs the town bank, and by gum no one is going to tell her what to do.  The prevailing notion among Hollywood screenwriters is that if you give the characters some quirky traits you can make them instantly loveable.  Who cares about character development when you have a woman banker named `Joe'?  The townspeople are broadly-painted caricatures of small-town bumpkins; I guess that's supposed to make them charming.This film looks and feels so much like Raising Arizona that one wonders if there were some Coen brothers wannabes behind the production of this film, which is really sad because aside from Fargo, any Coen brothers film is largely unsatisfying.  Happy, Texas, does not fail to leave the same lingering sense of unfullfillment.There is no substance to this film.  All the actors float over the scenes like two-dimensional cutouts, saying their lines and squinting as they practice their southern accents.  There is no sense of urgency or habitation, and everyone seems so involved with themselves that they can barely acknowledge the existence of others.  Many, many little self-involved soliloquies dot this film from start to finish as each character thinks the others want to know all about him.  Someone please explain to me why Hollywood thinks that characters talking endlessly about themselves is not worse than its polar opposite  action movies where explosions occur every five minutes and the hero utters some inane catch phrase after dispatching twelve attackers.  Plot holes abound.  Why did the guy go on the date with the sheriff, for instance?  He could just as easily have turned him down.  The dialogue is a howler.  `There is nothing fuzzy about what I feel for you.'  I think that line is from Shakespeare.I recommend you avoid this tiresome video and find something else.

Why this for him? Sure, it's a step up from Mimic, but after Emma and The Winslow Boy? The one reason to see this movie is William Macy. He was SO wonderful and open and vulnerable as the sheriff with a secret that I really felt for his plight as you would for a friend. He was really the most developed and likable of the characters here. And I think it's good that the audience (at least as I saw it) is much more concerned with whether he'll end up happy than anyone else. There were a lot of annoying inconsistencies, like where the two convicts are getting their fabulous wardrobe from. And why Ally Walker seems to have gotten a perm for one scene and then taken it out for the next. But the movie is so slight that it is't worth caring about. This is one of those Miramax movies that comes out and plays in smaller theaters even though it is every bit as slick, predictable and mainstream as anything else out there.

There's a slapdash quality to the casting, with	Northam ineffective as the solid centre and Zahn getting by on a weird collection of mannerisms rather than a coherent character - Macy is affecting in his role, but the film is a bit fuzzy about the details of his personal self-discovery. Even the closing pageant is barely exploited for comic value. The movie might be deliberately going against the grain of standard plotting, but it doesn't really seem so - it's a not particularly interesting mix of obvious set-ups and plot gambits and discursive if not arbitrary execution.

People mistake them for something they're not (gay pageant organisers) and are exceptionally friendly to them despite their initial hostility. At first they are driven crazy by the strange (but cute) goings on in the small town, but in the end discover love and a new-found respect for rural life.All right, the themes are slightly different - Happy deals rather more with crime and homosexuality - but it's essentially the same film. What raises both into the category eminently watchable is the performances. Fox, Julie Warner (what happened to her?), Bridget Fonda and Woody Harrelson were all appealing in Doc Hollywood. Happy, Texas gives five under-used actors a chance to shine.Jeremy Northam is likeable in the lead - his accent rarely slips for one thing, and he's good-looking and good-natured enough to endear the character to you (he's a criminal, remember). Ally Walker pulls off a rather lame role (frustrated - but spunky! - small town girl) with sympathy and subtlety, even if her falling for Northam in the last reel feels all wrong. The wonderful Illeana Douglas (someone give this woman a lead role NOW) is exquisite as usual as the enthusiastically horny local teacher.But it's Steve Zahn and William H. Macy who bring the most to the movie. Zahn invests every line with the sort of comic energy I thought had died with the decline of Steve Martin. He's funny, cool, sweet and magnetic. Macy, meanwhile, is probably the pre-eminent actor in America today. He seems to understand every role he plays perfectly and inhabit it effortlessly and the role of the laconic, committed but confused sheriff Chappy is no exception. If it was possible, I would campaign for having these two in every movie ever made.I'm not sure why this film has been marginalised as a gay movie - as if there was any such thing outside the porn industry anyway - as it only has one major gay character and it's not about homosexuality at all, it's about love and life and redemption and tolerance. In fact, it's about what most mainstream rom-coms are about. (And it doesn't have Julia Roberts in it. Which has to be good.) It's a more-than-moderately funny, pretty conventional comedy movie with excellent performances and a semi-happy ending. I recommend it.

However, I do think that this one deserves more than just my vote.  It is what I expect when I sit down to watch a movie pure entertainment and a whole lot of fun!  Try to rent the DVD instead of the video if you can.  The commentaries alone are worth the rental price.  They are just as funny as the movie itself.  Don't expect too much out of the story, it is supposed to be a light-hearted comedy and not something that you should be too serious about.  Steve Zahn's performance is spectacular.  He is probably one of the funniest actors on film.  William H. Macy scores again in what I consider one of his best roles so far.  He really nailed the part and made it totally believable.  The movie is very sweet and warm-hearted but not in a cheesy or heavy tone.  This is what you get when you do a movie just for the sake of it and not because you expect to get a 30 million dollar weekend box office.  Director Mark Illsley and writer Ed Stone did a great job considering the little amount of time and budget that they had.  See Happy Texas for yourself and you will not regret it.

Sadly the other half, Jeremy Northam's handsome conman, remains stuck in a dull romance with the town's only pretty blonde - when he isn't being pursued by the local sheriff.It's a weird film with characters that are a struggle to like or believe and while there are a very few laugh out loud moments for most of the film it feels like hard work to find anything genuinely amusing.Northam is particularly boring to watch due to his apparent inability to produce facial expression. Perhaps he attended the Roger Moore School of Facial Acting... He was much better as an equally (but suitably) 'blank' corporate spy in the low budget sci-fi Cypher. Which I recommend.

Plus these guys are always good, and Steve Zahn is inspired crazy.Northram and Zahn are odd-couple convicts on the run and con men on the make. Zahn, all crank and id, seems to have the harder task pretending to be a gay pageant director enduring the horror of all those sweet little girls, but it's soon clearly a draw as his pretend boyfriend, Northram, smart and smooth, fends off suspicions and a gay suitor. Both men are also suffering from scam-induced blue balls from the off-limits affections of what would otherwise be their love interests. The attraction of this movie for me is not only these amusing classic tensions, but the original way it resolves these. There's something touching in the determination of Zahn's character to work through the situation that's not like the poignancy of Macy's character or the sensitivity Northram's exhibits. But none of these guys is a wuss either, all the actors have attractive but distinctly different personalities, anyone of which can make you smile.

A pair of convicts, Wayne Wayne Wayne and Harry Sawyer, are lucky to be in an highway accident where the van that is transporting them overturns. The duo steal the RV, they happen to see in a shopping area. It turns out the vehicle belong to the real gay men who go around the country preparing little girls for this important event in their lives, and they decide not to report it to the police.As it turns out, Happy, Texas, welcomes them with open arms, or so it seems. The local sheriff, Chappy Dent, of all people, is a man struggling with his own sexual identity. Wayne is put in charge of the training of the girls for the pageant. Harry sees an angle in the local bank that shows a lack of security; it's the perfect target for a robbery.When all it's said and done, Happy, Texas misses opportunities, when the pageant takes second place to a car chase. Director Mark Illsley, who contributed to the screen play, probably had great ideas going for the film, which ultimately fizzled out. Best thing in the film is Steve Zahn's Wayne, a man who can't carry a tune. Jeremy Northam, an actor more at home playing dramatic roles, makes a surprising Harry, which shows his range. The wonderful William H. Macy appears as the mixed up sheriff Chappy Dent. Mr. Macy and Mr. Northam are hilarious doing the two-step at the local gay bar.

Taking him on a date to a gay country bar and some of the funniest scenes with them dancing.Its a shame though that gay is sometimes played for laughs too much instead of with tenderness. Knowing the sheriff is going to get his heart broken and he does in such a painful way was very difficult to watch(I wish the writers would have not made it so mean(the scene has Gainey(Bob Maslow) with a gun hiding behind a door when Chappy knocks on it to see Harry and Harry having to get Chappy to leave to save his life decides to insult chappy,tell him to get out of his life and gives back a gift that chappy had given him,the look in Chappys face is so gut wrenching and his eyes which up to then were so sparkling show the pain.made me ache a little for him i just wanted to hug him) and of course his crying scene over being rejected drew some unintentional laughs which i thought was bad, i shed a tear for him myself knowing how he felt.the audience did seem to care about how he ended up which i was glad to see him end up with another man ,,ron perlman of all guys ends up being his lover .now that i did find amusing seeing them hold hands. the rest of the movie involving a bungled bank robbery ,the 2 excons turning into heroes and wrapping it up with a performance of the little girls at the jail was so corny at times.

Not only was it hillarious but the plot was one of the tightest I've seen in a long time.  The characters where well develloped and the dialogue was almost flawless.  The thing I can't figure out is how an egotistical maniac like Illsley could have pulled it off. Some of the special features on the DVD give clues as to what may have happened.  If you watch the interview with the two writers, Stone and Illsley, you grow to hate the latter with a passion.  Stone just seems to be a sex crazed D&D player who had nothing better to do.  So I thought to myself, how did these guys write such a well thought out screen play and then how did Illsley manage to direct it in a way that didn't mess the whole thing up.  Maybe he's a completely different person when he's not being interviewed but the deleted sceens and featurette suggest that there may have been other factors. If you watch the deleted scenes, only the very first scene fits with the movie in it's final form.  The rest of the cut scenes suggest that there was a lot of editing and re-writing of the script.  When coupled with the facts that it was first shown at Sundance and then buought by Miramax (notorious for taking over projects) one starts to think that maybe the film was shot twice.  First the version with all the horrible cut scenes, and then again after Sun Dance with much better dialogue and plot developement.In either case, I love the final product and highly recomend it to anyone who enjoys a good laugh.

It has so many touching characters in it, and some moments were just plain adorable.  First off, I don't think anyone can deny that Steve Zahn's character is absolutely perfect for the role and the movie.  His character is quite definitely the heart of the movie.  When he first arrives in Happy, he is utterly clueless when it comes to matters of the heart, and finally learns compassion and empathy.  It is somewhat a stereotype that a good environment saves the bad guy, but at least it's better than what would have happened if the bad guy comes and saves the town.  I think Jeremy Northam's character is compassionless.  His decisions don't make him seem at all likeable, and his relationships with the banker and the sheriff just make him seem like a shady, sneaky backstabbing creep without any desire to even help out anyone.  He also never gives a helping hand to Zahn with the Happy Girls.  By the end, we're left with a guy that broke and betrayed everyone he had fooled into loving him.  Worst of all is the banker ended up falling in love with him, even though he wasn't going to see her for two years.   The only reason this happened was to make him seem like a good guy even just because he happened to be one of the main characters.  This all comes after he made her realize long distance relationships are the perfect recipe for heart break.  By the end, I was hoping she would just run away from that creep.  By comparison, Steve Zahn's relationship with Schafer was much more touching and realistic, and I believed they could actually end up living together in a happy relationship.The other character worth noting is William H. Macy as Sheriff Chappy.  He, along with the Happy Girls, made the film seem overly sweet and good-hearted.  He was certainly the most touching character in the film, and he is the perfect archetype for the town of Happy.  He is cheerful, hopeful, good-hearted, and always willing to do his share of everything.  He is also the only main character of the film that is gay in this gay comedy so, without him the film would be rather annoying.  Actually, when he falls for Northam's character, you feel both happy and melancholic for him.  You're happy he's found something to love and to relieve his loneliness, yet you know the relationship is going to end badly, and that he will be hurt.  He is just as important for the momentum of the film as Zahn.  Without him, the film would be lacking so much.I do not think this movie is overly stereotypical or holds an intentional agenda.  I read one review of this by a gay reviewer that said it was the most homophobic film of the year, but I don't think that was true at all.  While it is true it is slightly absurd to think a couple, gay or not, would get excited to see their trailer was stolen, I think it makes perfect sense as part of a zany comedy.  I don't think it is offensive to have the gay characters in a film to act ridiculous in a comedy where every character is ridiculous.The greatest moment of the film was when The Happy Girls performed Bjork's version of It's Oh So Quiet.  It is one of my favorite scenes from any movie made in 1999, partially because I am a huge fan of Bjork.  I really enjoyed the lighthearted touch the girls offer during the end of the movie.  When they help save the town with their somewhat impressive, and totally unexpected, fighting techniques, I was truly touched.  I realized how Steve Zahn's character really affected the town, and how he affected the town just as much as the town affected him.  The movie needed more of Zahn and Miss Schafer and the girls and less of Northam's manipulation of the banker.  The movie would have been nearly perfect if Northam seemed to have the same sort of affect on the town as Zahn had, and if Macy's character had been focused on a little more.  As is, Happy, Texas, is merely a good standard comedy that is not afraid of breaking a few of the traditions of the stereotypical jargon Hollywood thinks we need to see.  Overall rating 8/10.

It is entertaining, with a little bit of just about everything  humor, pathos, story, tension, authenticity, sex, mistaken identities, and even a true-to-its-title ending.  For those who cannot stand to go to a movie without some violence (I'm not one of those), it even has some of that, but not so much that it is offensive to someone like me.The story line is very original; the script, well-written; the rhythm well-paced.  Some may criticize that the development of the story is predictable -- for me, though, it has a natural unfolding along with little delightful surprises.  I became most interested in and appreciative of the development of the various relationships, which is no easy accomplishment in the 90 or so minutes available to a feature film.Happy, Texas presents homosexuality in much the same way as does the movie In and Out.  Perhaps the portrayals are stereotypical, but I felt that it was devoid of insulting those who choose a means of expression different from society's norm.  Since I'm not gay, I admit there may be an insult that eludes me, but I do hope not.Kudos to the actors.  In particular, I applaud Steve Zahn's dead-pan humor and antics; William H. Macy's totally believable and touching portrayal of a gay sheriff, evoking laughs and compassion; Jeremy Northam's straight straight-man; Ally Walker's honesty in the role of the small-town banker; and one of my favorite character actors, Illeana Douglas as an expressive school teacher.I personally would like to see more movie making like this  original story, layered characters and plot, authentic touches, properly placed symbols, and fine acting.  Some of the film is just plain silly, so if you are looking for a serious crime drama or violence, choose another film.

Yet, for all its scattered moments of whimsical charm, the film merely demonstrates that a cute premise and a genial tone are insufficient compensation for an underfed screenplay that fails to generate many substantial laughs.  Since even the premise itself lacks real freshness, the movie must finally be judged on the quality of its execution.  This is the umpteenth version of that old chestnut in which two fugitives on the lam find safety by impersonating individuals with personalities completely antithetical to their own  (we've seen them many times before - disguised as women, priests, nuns, cruise directors, choir directors, you name it ).  Finally unmasked for all to see in their nakedness and shame, such characters inevitably find their redemption in the generous attitudes and forgiving hearts of the people they may have deceived it is true, but also touched in some deep emotional way.   Following slavishly in the footsteps of all these previous films, `Happy, Texas' fairs badly in comparison since, although it sets up a situation rife with farcical possibilities, it never really finds the manic energy or ingeniously convoluted and multi-layered plot structure necessary to the success of such a film.  Steve Zahn and Jeremy Northam charmingly portray chain gang partners who, suddenly finding themselves escaped prisoners, stumble into a small Texas town where they are immediately mistaken for a gay couple hired to direct a little girl beauty pageant.  The scene in which the two macho men discover the `truth' about the men they are impersonating is genuinely hilarious and  betokens many more laughs to follow.  Yet somehow, they never manage to develop.   For one thing, the men essentially go their separate ways during the majority of the film's running time so the comic tension that exists between them simply dissipates.  In addition, the beauty pageant concept is a dud since having these girls be of such a young age gives the men's forcibly repressed heterosexuality no room for comic play.  Thus, the comic possibilities inherent in being a straight man trapped in a gay man's body seem strangely underplayed and unexploited.   Moreover, both the conventional romances between the lead characters and their respective women and the `unconventional' one between Northam and the suddenly smitten gay sheriff (William H. Macy) fail to result in any real sparks or passion.  In fact, the movie as a whole simply lacks energy and imagination.As director and co-writer, Mark Illsley ruins many of his most promising comic moments by relying on overly emphatic reaction shots and routinely holding them for just a beat too long.  More than anything else, movie comedy succeeds or fails based on the delicate rhythm that is established between the spoken word and the edited image.  Perhaps, it is this lack of comic grace more than anything else that keeps `Happy, Texas,' likable as it is at times, from fulfilling the promise of its premise and really soaring into comic greatness.

This just needed a better script and less forced plot to be an interesting character film.

William H Macy is terrific, and is the saving grace of this otherwise ho-hum story. His face is so expressive, and he's perfect as a small-town sheriff with a good heart. I'm not sure what the casting director was thinking, putting Jeremy Northam in the leading role. It should have been someone less evil-looking, more intellectual, and funnier. Like Jeff Goldblum. I spent the movie trying to decide if I liked him or not. Turns out I didn't. All in all, if you've got a Sunday afternoon to kill, have at it. But don't expect to laugh. Much.

It's been a long time since I've seen so many montages in one film. I don't have a problem with it but the purpose of the montage is to summarise a lenght of time passing by. In this film the technique was used solely for comic effect...and it worked. The problem was that when it then came to the actual passing of time there was a lack of comic value and an inability to make it any way realistic. I know it's comedy and it's slapstick to a degree and it doesn't need to be realistic but, unless the comic elements are in place properly the lack of realism can't be ignored.William H. Macy steals the show and really really shows the other actors up. He's got some great lines and acts the slapstick comic role really well. Steve Zahn is pretty good too. Certainly not his worst role and shines in his montages. Jeremy Northam was a bad choice for for the role of Harry / Steve. I haven't seen him in that much stuff so I wouldn't like to say he's a bad actor but, I don't think he can do comedy. It smelt like cheese every time he spoke.If you're in a silly mood and up for a laugh this is worth watching. There is much better comedy out there though. This doesn't come close to anything from the Ben Stiller / Wes Anderson / Wilson Brothers / Will Ferrel stables.

There's even a chase sequence near the end and a sentimental climax, just in case you were wondering.  The sheer laziness of the whole thing is astonishing the central conceit of the film is that two criminals have to pretend to impersonate two other people but whereas a good film might delight in the details of their challenge, in this film we see only the most perfunctory demonstration of their act, as if the writer found his own idea as boring as I did. William Macy's sheriff provides some real laughs, though these seem to fall more outside the narrative of the film than within it, in that they are funny as parodies of the naff romantic scenes you sometimes get in films like this.  And there are a few neat gags about smalltown life, though no satirical venom (and in a film about beauty paegents, that is is pretty damning incitement in itself).  Indeed, the contrast between the sweet small town and the bad bad criminals is itself thrown away, as needless to say, we always know the bad guys have hearts of gold really.  But the film left this reviewer with a heart of lead.

Harry Sawyer (Jeremy Northam) and Wayne Wayne Wayne Jr. (Steve Zahn) are two criminals imprison for minor crimes, Harry for bank robbery and forgery, Wayne for auto theift.  While working in a chain gang, highway litter control detail, they get into a fight with the infamous murderer Bob (M.C. Gainey).

The RV battery dies, which leaves Harry and Wayne stranded, until a local sheriff named Chappy (William H. Macy) spots the RV and is relieved to find the two men.  You see, Chappy thinks that Harry and Wayne are the two beatuy experts, that the town is awaiting for.  So Harry and Wayne are trapped in the small town of Happy, Texas, with the entire town thinking that they are there to help prepare for the beauty pagent. Harry and Wayne soon realize that the pagent is for pre-teen girls, which has Harry forcing Wayne to train the little girls for the pagent.  While Wayne is losing his patience and his sanity training the little girls, Harry tries to figure out a way to break into the town's bank, run by Josephine McLintock (Alley Walker).  What unexpectedly happens is that Harry begins to fall in love with Josephine, while Harry begins to enjoytraining for the pagent, with the help from Ms. Schafer (Illeana Douglas). HAPPY, TEXAS was a very funny film.  The premise is typical (a fish out of water story), but for this film is somehow works. It's not because of the plot, but because of the acting. All of the actors do a great job with this film.  They take a sitcom story, and turn it into a worth-while film.  Jeremy Northam, Alley Walker, and Illeana Dougals are all very good in their roles.  They take usual style characters and turn them into different types of characters.  They seem more realistic, than stereotyped or cardboard.  But Steve Zahn and William H. Macy really make the film shine. Zahn is always a delight to watch (just watch THAT THING YOU DO, SURBURBIA, and OUT OF SIGHT).  And in this film, he shows that he can carry a film, and still not over-do any of his comedy or talent.  And William H. Macy is excellent in his role as the town sheriff.  I personally haven't seen Macy this good in a role since FARGO.  I'll be upset if he doesn't get a Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  And there are scenes that Macy doesn't speak at all, yet his facial expressions can explain his feelings and emotions.  I think Steven Seagal should take some lessons from Macy on how to act. Overall, HAPPY TEXAS isn't the funniest film of the year, but it is a enjoyable one.  The jokes aren't too crude, but they still manage to be funny.  And director Mark Illsley, keeps the film's pacing at a good speed.  But if anybody should walk away from HAPPY TEXAS as winners, it should be the actors.

This time, however, I neglected to do so and paid the price.Happy, Texas is a flimsy, lightweight of a movie that misses every chance it had to be funny.  Rather than satirize the stereotypical country bumpkin - whom everyone would quickly recognize as unreal and stereotypical - the film chooses to go the condescending route of real Texans can be gay, too.  We know they're real because they drink long-neck Buds and like to go rabbit hunting.  The homosexual characters in this film are just good 'ole boys in cowboy hats who like line-dancing with each other out in rural Texas.  How democratic.  How normal. What starts out as slap-stick a la Martin and Lewis, quickly degenerates into a pseudo-sensitive soap opera.  As truly unfunny as I find the original Jerry Lewis, he is infinitely more acceptable than the violently stupid character played by Steve Zahn.  The difference, of course, is that the characters which Jerry Lewis played never existed in reality, whereas one can encounter Steve Zahn's addle-brained character in half-way houses from sea to shining sea.  Funny, it isn't.In keeping with the psychologically-correct ethos of female empowerment, all the women in this film are stronger than the men.  In this movie the heroine runs the bank and is the leading light in the town, while the unhappy sheriff can be found at the side of the road weeping.  The only two strong men in the film are the pathological Zahn character and a homicidal-maniac bank robber.  Almost all the other men are either complete buffoons, morons, or repressed homosexuals. The popularity of this film may be some sort of social commentary in itself, but as a movie Happy, Texas is neither happy nor Texas. "}{"Title":"Happy just isn't funny. (spoilers)","Date":"7 January 2006","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":" Happy, Texas follows your standard deception comedies. Harmless deviants who assume a false identity (or some kind of false characteristic) lead on a couple of nice town residents, inadvertently bring some joy to the town solving whatever problem they have, and meanwhile, not going through with the scheme they had originally attended before they won the trust of the town, only to be exposed anyway and things ending up with a happy resolution for all. Movies like these, too, are a dime a dozen in Hollywood. Similar instances that I can think of are 'The Experts,' 'She's All That,' '10 Things I Hate About You,' and so forth. They need not be romantic comedies, but they usually are. And Happy, Texas is just one more forgettable version to top the list.Here, three guys are suddenly prison fugitives after the van they're riding in overturns. One goes his own way while the other two stumble upon a small Texas town, and steal the motorhome of two gay men who are notorious for their work in preparing young girls for pageants. So the two guys pose as the gay pageant duo and help out the town's pageant woe's while plotting to rob the local bank. Of course, they gain the trust of the town and both fall in love with two local women and meanwhile help out the Sheriff figure out his sexual identity. And then the first guy returns and threatens to blow their cover, especially because he wants a piece of the bank action, too.At least Steven Zahn was a little funnier here in his ritual performance as the dimwitted spaz. "},{"Title":"Annoying, unfunny, condescending","Date":"12 October 1999","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":"  Stupid, dull, extremely low-budget (and it shows) comedy abou two escaped convicts who steal a van and have to portray two gay men putting on a beauty pageant (don't ask).  The plot is unbelievable and stupid; the acting is, with one exception, lousy; the dialogue is terribly unfunny; and the film is so obviously made for straight audiences who think it's OK to be gay...as long as we don't see anything too offensive, like the two guys kissing or hugging.  Also, there's no way the residents of a small town in Texas are going to be so accepting of two gay  men.  The only bright spot here is William Macy as a gay cop, he manages to give a very realistic performance and makes the bad dialogue sound pretty good.  All in all, though, this movie should be avoided at all costs. "}]
