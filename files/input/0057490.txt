[{"Title":"Superb, sinister movie","Date":"25 November 2002","Score":"46 out of 49 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  This is a superb, sinister movie of the very highest class.  Unlike the character Tony (James Fox) who is upper class without being high class, if you get my drift.  You cannot really sympathise with Tony, who toys with some high falutin' development projects but basically is a wastrel just waiting to be ponced off.  Tony is a later-day Bertie Wooster.  The sinister element comes from the servant (Dirk Bogarde), who is no Jeeves.  Barrett, like Jeeves , is a gentleman's gentleman or valet (not a butler as suggested in some other comments on this film).  Tony needs a valet because he is incapable of doing anything much without help.  Barrett and his accomplice Vera (Sarah Miles) take Tony to the cleaners, sweeping aside the fiancee Susan (Wendy Craig) in their wake.Harold Pinter has written the screenplay in similar vein to the superb movie The Accident, also a Losey piece, which I also commend. The cinematography in both movies is simply excellent.  The subject matter of The Servant suits Pinter, although much of the screenplay is not really in Pinter's voice.  However, there is one scene, set in a restaurant, which includes a tiny cameo by Pinter himself and which contains a short Pinteresque exchange between two women.  There is also one tense exchange between Susan and Barrett do you wear deodorant etc. which is very reminiscent of a scene in The Caretaker you stink from arsehole to Thursday etc.  Indeed the story of The Servant resembles The Caretaker in many respects, except that in The Servant the interloper, Barrett, is on top and stays there, whereas in The Caretaker the interloper, Davies, lacks the skill and circumstances to dislodge the incumbent.There is a homoerotic undercurrent to the film and this works so well because it is an undercurrent (in 1963 there could have been no more than an undercurrent even if they had wanted more).  The overt debauchery with Vera and the orgy party towards the end of the film is the only bit of the film that has aged without grace.  But I quibble.This is a truly great film and it deserves to be more widely known.

Once seen, it's never quite forgotten, and it's fascinating to see it once again beautifully restored and uncut in its new DVD release.  Aspects of it stick with you years later, most especially the dark, moody torch song with some bizarre lyrics which is played repeatedly throughout the story on Mr. Tony's record player, seeming more sinister with each successive playing.  By the time of its final hearing near the end of the movie, its effect is so oppressive that it's a relief when the record player is violently shoved off the table.  One telling detail is in the scene where Mr. Tony is left alone after Barrett and Vera are expelled from the house, and his fiancee Susan also disappointedly leaves him.  He dejectedly goes to an upstairs bedroom, and on the wall above the bed we see pictures of male body-builders.The cast is uniformly excellent.  This was apparently James Fox's film debut, as his credit indicates `Introducing James Fox.'  He was obviously an experienced actor, though.  In contrast, four years later he was affecting an American accent, singing and dancing, and amazingly, looking even younger in `Thoroughly Modern Millie.'This is the sort of role that I always associate Dirk Bogarde with.  The way Barrett's malevolent character is gradually revealed, not just through the script, but through Bogarde's facial expressions and body language, is a credit to this great actor's skill.  This is one dangerous guy.`The Servant' is a real gem of early 60's British film.

Good performances from Fox and the doyenne of the slightly barmy 60's flick, Sarah Miles are mandatory in order to keep up with the entirely convincing theatrics of Dirk Bogarde's morally abstract butler, Barrett. Losey keeps everything claustrophobic there's also an edginess through the stiltedness of set pieces - in restaurants and bars, and even in the Mounset's country pile. The only scene which seems comfortable is the snow(fight) sequence in which Susan and Tony affirm their love - and the moral height from which Tony must fall.Bizarrely, the film is erotic for the first half but then simply frightening for the second, the drama wound around a single moral trajectory - downwards - throughout. We are engulfed from the start with open-ended sexual permissiveness and suggestion, which runs alongside the class divide whose tension drives the drama to the same degree. In the final scenes I couldn't remove Berg's opera on Wedekind's play Lulu from my mind, given the sax-fronted jazz of John Dankworth colliding awkwardly with a simultaneous orchestral score. It's just a brilliant, original film - analysis resistant, but entirely absorbing nonetheless 8/10 "},{"Title":"Fighting for Power in the British Class Warfare","Date":"17 May 2007","Score":"31 out of 34 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" The aristocratic Tony (James Fox) moves to London and hires the servant Hugo Barrett (Dirk Bogarde) for all services at home.

When Barrett brings his sister Vera (Sarah Miles) to work and live in the house, Tony has a brief hidden affair with her. After traveling with Susan for spending a couple of days in a friend's house outside London, the couple unexpectedly returns and finds Barrett and Vera, who are actually lovers, in Tony's room. They are fired and Susan breaks with Tony. Later, Tony meets Barrett alone in a pub and hires him back, and Barrett imposes his real dark intentions in the house, turning the table and switching position with his master.While watching the quite unknown The Servant, at least three points called my attention. The first one is the impressive cinematography and the camera work and movements, shooting in unusual angles inclusive with a great use of mirrors. The second one is the stunning performance of Dirk Bogarde, in the role of a sinister, amoral and cynical character that plots a Machiavellian dark plan to achieve power in the British class warfare. Last but not the least, the ambiguous screenplay, with eroticism and insinuations that Tony is actually bisexual, missing the services of his servant. I do not know if my mind is quite dirty with the sexual liberty of the present days, but I saw many elements indicating that Tony's connection with Barrett is actually sexual attraction. In 1963, I believe the censorship would be strong regarding sex and drugs and the screenplay is open to more than one interpretation. Sarah Miles is extremely beautiful in this highly recommended movie.

Even so, Bogarde's performance (recipient of the BAFTA award) is understated most of the time - which rather suits his enigmatic title character, a self-described gentleman's gentleman but actually harboring sinister ambitions. Interestingly, when Joseph Losey fell ill in mid-production, the directorial chores were thrust into the hands of the leading man until his recovery - who, amusingly, initially turned Losey down by saying that he couldn't direct a bus if his life depended on it! While he was still some years away from the deliberate formalism that virtually characterized all his later output, Losey's style is here more controlled - for lack of a better word - than in, say, THE CRIMINAL (1960) or EVA (1962); this may have been due to the 'failure' of the latter (see my review elsewhere), or perhaps his collaboration with screenwriter (and influential playwright) Harold Pinter may have had more to do with this than anything else. Still, Douglas Slocombe's sleek black-and-white cinematography (also a BAFTA award winner) of the gloomy London settings - abetted by Johnny Dankworth's wistful score - is certainly among the film's most notable assets.James Fox's fine performance as the usurped master of the house led him to short-lived stardom (and even copped the young actor the Most Promising Newcomer award at the BAFTAs); his career went on an extended hiatus some years later (which ended in the mid-Eighties) following his traumatic experience on the set of PERFORMANCE (1970), curiously enough a film dealing with a similar role-reversal situation! Though the women are subservient to the central relationship between Bogarde and Fox, both Sarah Miles and Wendy Craig serve their characters well; especially interesting is the battle of wits between the latter (as Fox's upper-class girlfriend) and Bogarde, whom she mistrusts from the get-go and is obviously proved right beyond her wildest imagination! For a two-hour dialogue-driven film, the plot is pretty sparse - typically of Pinter, dealing in symbolism rather than presenting a straightforward narrative (despite being based on a novel by Robin Maugham) - but the tension between the various characters holds the viewer's attention all the way...though the final descent into depravity and degradation comes off as rather too abrupt and now seems more farcical than shocking (as it must have seemed at the time)! The cast also includes bit parts by two alumni of Losey's THE CRIMINAL - co-star Patrick Magee and screenwriter Alun Owen, sparring amusingly as a couple of clergymen in a bar! - as well as Pinter himself (a former actor in his own right, appearing as a 'society man' in the same scene, actually one of the very few set outside Fox's mansion).There's a hilarious scene in which James Fox goes with Wendy Craig to visit her mummified high society parents. This enables Bogarde and Miles to live it up at the house during their absence. However, they cut short their visit and catch them romping about in their master's bedroom, whereupon he sacks them on the spot. This leads to the film's best scene, in my opinion the chance meeting in a bar between Bogarde and Fox (who has, in the interim, fallen on hard times) where the Mephistophelean Bogarde paints a pitiful picture of himself which, inevitably, leads the lonesome Fox to engage his services once more. The way Losey shoots this marvelous sequence is masterly - with a minimum of camera movement and the actors strategically placed within the frame.Trivia note I own a British periodical from the early 80s called The Movie - a collection of essays strung together more or less by theme and running for an impressive 158 volumes - in which THE SERVANT was among the films chosen for a two-page critical evaluation, accompanied by a detailed synopsis and illustrated by numerous stills; I've leafed through it and read the review (written by Derek Prouse) so many times that these images from the film have become fixed in my mind and, as I lay watching, I was actively looking out for each one of them!

Though I would not consider it as being flawless, it is a very interesting and indeed memorable piece of British cinema.The characters itself could have been taken from P. G. Wodehouse's hilarious series of comic novels about the perfect butler Jeeves and his 'master' 'Bertie' Wooster, a young, superficial, and careless dandy who could not make one step without Jeeves constantly caring for him.In The Servant, a similar relationship is twisted in a much darker way Hugo Barrett is not at all the faithful servant devoted to his master - though he appears to be at the beginning -, but a scheming, quite evil person who knows very well what he wants. (Though the real motives of his deeds do not become completely clear in the story - but this makes him probably even scarier.)Dirk Bogarde was just wonderful. Most impressive. His body language, shifting from servile to casual, menacing or frivolous is meticulously developed and executed. The supporting actors were also good, notably James Fox. Sarah Miles tried everything to bring life to her rather cartoonish character, though she never could make me understand how Tony could be so sexually attracted to a woman like her in the first place.I loved the homoerotic undertones of the Barrett-Tony relationship, especially in the second half of the film, after Barrett's return. They two men often act like a (gay) couple, especially in their disputes. There is also a great piece of dialogue between the two, written in tongue-in-cheek manner by Pinter, when they talk about feeling being pals and mention that they have felt like that in the army before. The loveliest scene was the one where Barrett tells Tony that his old flame (Susan) has arrived and then says in a flirtatious manner one yesterday - and one tonight while holding Tony's face in his hand. We don't know yet at this point that he has invited some prostitutes, so this remark seems quite ambigous for a moment...The symbolism is great, the many mirrors in the film forming a substitute for Barrett's gaze, never leaving Tony and Susan. There is also some phallic symbolism (most openly in the long shot of the garden just after the scene when Vera arrives at Tony's house). And Douglas Slocombe's black-and-white photography is just about incredible.What I liked less about the film was that it was a weird mixture of what is basically a 19th century morality tale, but set in the 1960s and shot in the manner of the 1930s (the latter being no problem at all, but rather increasing the value of the film). The scenes with the women, especially the erotic scenes, were also rather awkward and very Sixties in style, so many of them seemed quite out of date, viewed today. The morality of the story was also quite flat in my opinion, and I must admit that I didn't care too much for Tony, this lazy and not very intelligent rich young dandy. In fact, I rather enjoyed Barrett catching the fly in his web...

You know it's   probably bad for you, (you want its 'villian' to make mince-meat of its   wan, effete 'hero'), but you're addicted. From its opening frame it   draws you in and it never, never lets you go.    It's almost too easy, too blasÈ to say it's about corruption or even   that it's about evil. (Is Barrett evil because he destroys Tony and   latterly Susan?). Rather, I think, it's a movie about need, the need   too be desired or wanted or simply loved, (though if it's a love story   you might say it's a very peculiar one; it's the one emotion that   appears to be peculiarly absent). It's based on a novel by Robin   Maugham but it's a vast improvement on the book. A good novel can   create space where our imagination can roam free. Even a densely   plotted novel will leave room for us to fill in the blanks. Films tend   not to do this. What appears on the screen is often literally what is   intended. (Some movies deliberately leave things out; some movies make   us work hard for our enjoyment).    The film of The Servant is both literal and elusive. Losey's   mise-en-scene is very deliberate. The pleasures a movie affords like   decor, crisp (and 'intelligent') imagery, the use of music to heighten   a mood or an emotion are all there. The acting is flawless, (but more   of that later). The elusiveness comes from Harold Pinter's script. Here   his famous 'pregnant pauses' become 'gaps' in what drives the   characters. We think we know them but really we don't. People are not   what they seem. (As if to stress the point he gives us a scene in a   restaurant where we eavesdrop on the conversations of diners where one   character says something that is misunderstood by another or simply by   us, the audience). In particular, he makes ambiguous the sexuality of   the principals. This may have been dictated by censorship though, to be   honest, the ambiguity is slight; the mutual attraction and the   master/slave relationship which develops seems to me to be clearly   homosexual. This is heightened by the extraordinarily fine performances   of Dirk Bogarde (Barrett) and James Fox (Tony). Barrett is a prissy old   queen and Tony is the ever so slightly effeminate younger man in thrall   of him. But Barrett can be 'butch' as well as 'nancy' when he has to   be. (It's a part Bogarde probably played only too well in real life).   He doesn't quite let you get a handle on him. Fox was new to movies but   you would never know it. This is a remarkably mature reading of an   immature young man. You can see that Fox can see the shadings in the   character that Pinter provides in the script and he gets under Tony's   skin completely.    There are two other two other superb performances in the film. As Vera,   the sluttish maid brought into the house to seduce Tony, Sarah Miles   exudes sexuality and vulnerability in equal measure, (she, too, was new   to movies and wasn't encumbered with the mannerisms of more seasoned   performers), while Wendy Craig is icy-cold, aloof and oddly sympathetic   as Susan, the rich girl engaged to Tony.    I have seen this film many times and each time it comes up fresh but   now I have warmed to its insidious charms or maybe I've just become   more jaded through my exposure to it. Handle with care.

There is vague talk of a project or two, but basically he fools around with his girlfriend Susan (Craig) and that's about it. He hires Hugo Barrett (Bogarde) as a manservant. Barrett is quiet and efficient, but he makes Susan uncomfortable, and she encourages Tony to get rid of him. Barrett brings in his sister Vera (Miles) as a maid for the household, and it doesn't take her long to seduce Tony. He later finds Barrett and Vera in his bed and learns that they're not related - except in purpose.This is a fascinating, murky psychological drama about seduction, the classes, and the strong versus the weak, with homoerotic undertones. The servant slowly becomes the master by preying on the vulnerabilities of a purposeless upper class playboy.The John Dankworth score, with vocals by Cleo Laine, has been mentioned. Frankly, I found it intrusive sleazy '60s music that contributes to dating The Servant. It's a shame, because the cinematography by Douglas Slocombe is exceptional, showing the house as it changes throughout Barrett's tenure and its gradual darkening, and his use of shadows and odd angles is exemplary.The acting is tremendous, with James Fox pathetic as the weak-willed Tony, and Sarah Miles sexy and vulnerable as Vera, and Wendy Craig is appropriately cold as Tony's fianc√©.But the star is Dirk Bogarde. As a predator of the weak and corruptible, Dirk Bogarde is fabulous - restrained, sinister, dignified, he gives no doubt who holds the power in the household. And when he drops the manservant act, shirttails hanging out, hair uncombed, and cigarette dangling from his mouth, he's downright scary. Bogarde began a new, non-matin√©e idol career for himself beginning with 1961's controversial film Victim, and his roles would grow more and more interesting as the years progressed. Bogarde is well-known in the U.S., perhaps becoming increasingly more well-known with his films being shown on TCM, but it's hard for us to measure his tremendous fame overseas. It's probably on a par with Gregory Peck's - they were both post-war stars who worked into the late '90s. My sister lived in England in the '70s, and I asked her if he was big over there, and she said, Uh - YEAH. Definitely worth seeing for the direction, acting, camera-work, and those Pinter touches.

Especially when Hugo's sister Vera (Miles) also arrives on the scene&#x85;The Servant remains as enigmatic today as it was back on its release in the early part of the 1960s. It's a film that defies classification, that rare old cinematic treat that continues to cause debate about not only its worth as art, but also its very meaning(s). A head bothering delight that revels in toying with your perceptions as much as Hugo Barrett enjoys toying with his supposed master. Lets play master and servant - indeed.Set predominantly in the confines of Tony's swanky Chelsea abode, there's a disturbing claustrophobia that pervades the narrative, and this before we even begin to ponder the power of man, his ability to dominate and manipulate, or the reverse side that sees another's lack of ability to not succumb to the downward spiral instigated by a supposed lesser man.Sprinkled over power issues are sexual desires, obtained, unfulfilled or simmering away unspoken. As the literate screenplay comes out in sharp dialogue snatches, breaking free of Pinter's other wise cement ensconced writing, there's evidence that this is a psychological study as opposed to the class system allegory that many thought it was way back then. This really isn't about role reversal, the finale tells us that.Visually it's a box of atmospheric tricks as well. Losey and Slocombe use deep angular black and white photography to enforce the chilly dynamics at work in the story, the longer the film goes on, as it gets to the nitty gritty, the more jarring the camera work becomes &#x96; delightfully so &#x96; the house no longer an affluent person's residence, but a skew-whiff place of debauchery and mind transference. And mirrors - reflections, important and used to great effect.Some scenes are striking and rich. Hugo at the top of the stairs standing in the bedroom doorway, in silhouette, an overhead shot of Hugo and Tony playing a childlike ball game on the stairs, a sex scene on a leather chair that we don't see but understand totally. And many more as Losey finds the material that allows him to show his skills.Cast performances are across the board terrific, particularly Bogarde who gives a visual acting master class, and Fox who beautifully shifts a gear from toff twit into dependant dead beat.

The subject isn't just masculine striving, it's the social structure of England.Essentially, Fox is a proper, spoiled upper-middle-class lawyer's son with an Eton hair cut and spacious town house in London. Craig's family is better off. We're talking one of those vast country estates run by two completely out-of-touch parents who can't tell a poncho from a gaucho. Fox and Craig are in love and everything looks rosy.Then Fox, tired of keeping his own house, hires Dirk Bogarde as a live-in manservant. Boy, is that a mistake. Bogarde is properly dressed and appropriately obsequious and suitably quiet as he slowly goes about keeping house and cooking. But he wangles his sister, teen-aged Sarah Miles, into the house as a maid.Miles, as you may or may not know, has this plump lower lip that runs from one side of her mouth to the other, a rack that, if set loose, would devastate the countryside, and a trembling girlish voice that bespeaks a sexual history that is at once debauched and virginal.One night, when Bogarde is presumably asleep upstairs, she stumbles upon Fox in the kitchen. Drops spatter slowly from the kitchen faucet into the tin basin as Fox gawks at her. (This is symbolic.) Ewww, isn't it hot in here?, she asks in tones that carry the contours of adolescence. I'm so hot. Are you hot? (The drops quicken their tempo.) Miles hitches her tiny skirt up an inch or so, sluices her haunch up onto the kitchen table, slips her girlish hand under her sweater and pats her little belly because of the torrid atmosphere. They should never eat from that table again.I don't have space to describe all the felicities of this production and artistic discretion prevents me from revealing too much of the plot.But I must say that Joseph Losey's direction is nearly impeccable. He has a painter's masterly eye. The compositions of each shot are exquisite without calling too much attention to themselves. Well, one example, so you'll know what I'm talking about. Miles has been thrown out and Bogarde is more or less in charge of the house, when the doorbell rings. It's a dripping wet Miles, apologizing fulsomely and begging to borrow a few quid. Josey has placed the camera almost at floor level in the vestibule. We see Bogarde open the door and an argument begins. Then Fox's dark trousers swish before the camera as he enters the scene and tells Bogarde to let her in. Bogarde is furious. He pulls Miles inside and throws her to the floor. She lands, sliding slightly, until her face is almost against the lens. All of this telling incident is captured in one longish take. It's like watching an illusionist perform an impossible trick on stage.I'd like to mention too the insane game of hide-and-seek the two men play, with a terrified Fox behind the bathroom curtain, and Bogarde with a demonic grin slowly searching, purring tauntingly like a child, Where arre you, puss, puss, puss? . . . Somebody has a guilty seee-cret . . . And meanwhile Fox's back lighted profile is cast on the shower curtain's slightly billowing folds so that his nose seems to grow and shrink by degrees. I'd like to mention that but I won't. I'll mention the oddball dissonance of the score, featuring a bassoon, instead.I don't know what Robin Maugham's book was like but Pinter's screenplay is rife with homosexual symbolism, Bogarde's own orientation being completely irrelevant one way or the other. You couldn't be too direct in 1963. And maybe after all it's better to say bisexual because neither Fox nor Bogarde seem disinclined to dalliance with the nubile Miles. Come to think of it, maybe pansexual would be still better. Who knows what went on in those late-night parties hosted by the now-dominant Servant? What a gripping exercise in style this is. Many critics didn't seem to care much for Pinter and Losey but I don't know why. The use of words like mannerisms doesn't help much. (What is mannerism anyway?) Don't we all have tics and tocs? Aren't some better -- more suited to their context -- than others?

Aside from Bogarde's (obviously) letter perfect portrayal of a sinister lower class valet with some ugly designs on his upper crust victim (well played also, by James Fox, who came to specialize in similar roles), one scene in particular stands out, and underlines beautifully the whole film's entire message. When Fox's aristocratic girlfriend (played by Wendy Craig) comes to visit, she has an amazing encounter with Bogarde. She suspects he's moving in on her boyfriend, ready to replace her in his affections. She imperiously orders him into the front room, abruptly quizzing him for his opinions on just about everything. She isn't concerned with his answers-she just enjoys ordering him around, Queen Victoria style. The effect is stunning-Bogarde clearly wants to strangle the bitch, but must restrain himself, he's only the servant after all. But he's still a man, and will get his revenge soon enough. The whole upper class system will be turned on its head. The resolution (if it can be called that) is not totally satisfying. In fact, it seems just as confused just and messy as life itself is.Some reviewers have stated that Ms. Craig was miscast as the classy girlfriend. Not so-as she imperiously and hatefully orders the helpless servant around, her face and voice become a hateful mask of the arrogance and cruelty of British snobbery.

When they first meet the two seem to hit it off quite well, falling comfortably into their positions of servant and master.However, once Tony's fianc√©e Susan (Wendy Craig) comes into the mix and disapproves of Barrett, things start to become more conflicted. Then, Barrett's sister Vera (Sarah Miles) comes to move in and her true nature, as Barrett's lover, throws an even stronger rift between the two and their class positioning. The intrusion of these women sets off a descent from their idyllic lifestyle and the two men spend the rest of the time clashing with one another, the walls slowly closing in on this gripping and powerful study.Director Joseph Losey makes great work of his tools here, using a lot of unique camera techniques like splitting the focus and viewing the characters through reflective surfaces rather than directly, which all serve to heighten the already high tension. The structure is bizarre and the final act gets surprisingly dark and borderline surreal, as the two engage in a series of fascinating interactions to further dissect the state of their dynamic. The Servant would be absolutely nothing without the performances of it's two men, and they both deliver in equal measures. The women are both superb as well, Craig being sharp and vicious, Miles being naive and sensual, but it's the boys show all the way through.Bogarde is breathtaking, convincingly portraying the gentleman's gentleman of a butler at first but slowly turning more sinister and terrifying as time passes on. He plays all sides of this character with total life, always remaining a mystery to the audience as we are never sure whether he is fooling Tony and us or if he's being sincere at any given moment. There's a scene between him and Susan where she digs into him and the pain on his face, the emasculation, actually allows the viewer to feel deeply for what could have been a very unlikeable character.Fox is no dull edge either, meeting Bogarde with a heartbreaking descent, falling from the mannered and composed young man we first meet into the shriveled and destroyed wreck by the end. The shifting dynamics between the two are always engaging, and Pinter embeds the film with just the right amount of emotion, comedy, terror and homoerotic subtext. It's a shattering work, marvelously performed by everyone involved.

The tale is simple enough... a handsome, boyish aristocrat courting alcoholism and marriage at the same time inherits a large fortune following his father's death. This requires him to take a house in London and, with the house, a manservant to run things. Enter Dirk Bogarde's Barrett, who initially seems innocuous enough. Sharp witted, polished and able, Barrett takes charge of all his master's domestic details with aplomb and the partnership between the two seems at first to go off swimmingly. Quickly enough, though, the contempt felt for Barrett by the master's fianc√©e (Wendy Craig as the implacably shrewish Susan) sets things on a dangerous downward path leading James Fox's Tony, by degrees, into an inferno of self destruction.The acting is uniformly superb. Bogarde is a marvel, as usual... here he is sly, devilish, calculating several moves ahead of his putative boss as he engineers a quiet and invidious sort of mayhem. Sarah Miles plays a seemingly idiotic coquette who exercises total command of the proceedings behind a succession of cunning masks. James Fox handles his transformation from n'eer do well gentleman to something out of a painting by Goya or Francis Bacon with great finesse.The cinematography and editing are beautiful and greatly contribute to the strained and intensely suspenseful atmosphere pervading this movie. The only weak point in the whole thing, and it is a minor weakness, is the overuse of one song throughout the movie. The producers should have splurged a bit more on the music or kept it more unobtrusive.I think The Servant was the inspiration, at least partly, for several other works I previously enjoyed. If this movie had never been made, would we have ever had Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? or Pasolini's Teorema or Tennessee Williams' short story, The Killer Chicken and the Closet Queen? I'm not sure but they all seem to flow from this amazing source in one way or another.

Watch how Bogarde sits absolutely, perfectly still on the chair in the attic, except for this subtly, yet unmistakably, he is working his jaw muscles, and they pulse with waves of seething anger, and you can read how unhappy he is, having to behave so subserviently to his new snob of a master. This is a magnificent bit of film-making.This movie, along with Victim, demonstrates what an extraordinary actor Dirk Bogarde was. Bogarde seems to have more control over every muscle in his body than any actor you will ever see. Not a finger twitches, not an eyebrow rises, not a single superfluous body part moves, that is not under the absolute control of Dirk Bogarde. In fact, every actor in this film is under the masterful control of the director. The camera-work too is mesmerizing, panning left and right here, and zooming in or out there. And look for the clever use of distorted mirrors and shadows (a naked Dirk Bogarde, for example) to indicate the action. This is real art, my friends.The plot is a strange one, though on paper it seems straight forward enough. Bogarde, as the newly hired servant, slowly but surely, through extreme manipulation, takes over the home of his new master. But this does not begin to describe how bizarre and extreme Bogarde's plots are. I don't think we ever really understand exactly what Bogarde's goal is here. He lets his girlfriend, Vera, seduce and carry on an affair with Tony, but why? Tony, enamored with Vera, loses his own fianc√©, and slowly gives up on life, ultimately changing from an idealistic and active member of the nobility to a complete drunken wreck. Bogarde befriends him, rising above the servant-master relationship, but it is such a weird co-dependent relationship &#x96; an extended sequence shows them trying to hit each other with a ball, and arguing about the score. We never really figure out what is going on in Bogarde's mind. The servant is indeed an enigma of a character.Sarah Miles, by the way, is achingly gorgeous and sexy as Bogarde's girlfriend. Nothing dirty happens directly on screen, yet some of the sex scenes are so cleverly suggestive that they will leave you panting. Look out particularly for the scene later in the movie where Fox takes Miles on an over-sized lounge chair &#x96;but we only see her legs and the back of the chair.The Servant is a truly bizarre and astonishing film, with tremendous acting and amazing directing. Highly recommended.

Long after I'd seen it, it stayed in my mind and worried me. I felt sorry for Tony, the rich aristocrat (James Fox) and frustrated for how he was treated, but also cross at his girlfriend for not doing anything to help him. His downfall was vividly portrayed by the great Fox and the miscreant Barrett played with superb calm and maliciousness by Dirk Bogarde was simply insidious but spectacular.Other than a psychological portrait of the moral and societal decline of Tony, it also highlights the blindness and callousness with which people act and don't really see or help anyone but themselves and are just selfish at heart. Even the posh people. I don't condone what the manservant did but I can see the frustration with which people in service must have felt and how easily they could be manipulated but trusting dolts who don't have a clue about anything as someone has always done for them.Everything about this production is dark and foreboding; the script relies on silences, and short dialogue, it uses darkness and grimness in the lighting and in the sets, despite it being a lovely rich home, and the decline is slow and painful to watch. You see ways he could have protected himself, how his girlfriend could have helped him but he is left alone to sink to the depths. Definitely not a Hollywood movie and it leaves you feeling emotionally shredded. As well as all this, the sexual tension of the film is quite intense, there is seduction between Tony and Vera, Barrett's sister girlfriend (a manipulative Sarah Mills) but also a weird homoerotic atmosphere between Tony and Barrett which doesn't really seem real or going anywhere or whether there's a point to it but it adds to the tension and dare I say it a sort sexual overtone to the film. I was surprised how explicit it was, and dealing with such taboo subjects for the time. It's a brilliant psychological drama but tragic and really really grim.

Only gradually do we realize what is actually going on, and both when we think one thing and find out another, we believe these people.

This is about the English class system and its imminent dissolution(at the time of its production), and I understand that it's not the only of such by Losey. With moody lighting, clever, lingering filming(with some nicely set up shots that show a mirror image or shadow) and smooth editing, this is expertly put together.

All of the music is perfectly chosen, changing in tone with the interiors of the newly furnished and painted house, as the alteration takes place. It's a very sensuous and sexy movie, without being explicit.

James Fox, brother of Edward Fox (Day of the Jackal), can still be found playing older, distinguished gentlemen in more current films. In this movie, the gentleman acts like a frat-house boy whose life is measured by the amount of alcohol he imbibes. When Dirk Bogarde becomes his valet, his new London townhouse takes on an orderliness, despite the antics of the young aristocrat. We soon find out, however, that the eerie efficiency of the servant is invasive and uncomfortable for both Fox and his girlfriend, Wendy Craig, who comes to dislike the servant.Gradually, the standards of the servant decline and he becomes noticeably less docile, much to the disgust of Susan (Wendy Craig). The servant brings in his girlfriend (Sarah Miles) and acts fast and loose with her just as the master feels free to. Susan thinks she knows how to handle a servant and the servant would not last long with her in charge. However, the standards in this household continue to descend into darkness as seen in a final orgy-like party. The movie exposes the basic nature of both servants and the masters when the class system breaks down. Of course,as long as the structure is in place, the masters can take advantage of it. In many households, the servants were the rigid defenders of knowing one's place. But by the 60's (when this movie takes place) the rules were being tested.The black and white film cuts away to a series of images that are like still photography. These images are enhanced by the snow-cover of the winter landscape.The end of the film is a disappointment and ruins the overall effect of the excellent acting and strong visual presentation for much of the film.

An alcohol and cigarettes-fueled blend of hetero and homo-eroticism, the principal characters tear at each other until stodgy British social class distinctions and behavior norms come crashing down. The last 25 minutes are mesmerizing; and was probably regarded by British audiences at the time as depraved.Harold Pinter wrote the screenplay. Joseph Losey and Dirk Bogarde handled direction.

The use of mirrors and common household objects (e.g., phones and dripping faucets) is done with great effect.Bogarde leads the excellent cast. He is sublime as the menacing, morally and sexually ambiguous social climber Hugo Barrett.

Douglas Slocombe, the prestigious British cinematographer, brings the film to life with his ingenious camera-work, the setting is largely confined interior to Tony's residence (dominantly in the shots is a bookshelf-shape door to the living room, camouflage beyond the veneer is a running theme here), Slocombe is ravishing the eroticism and tautness by his superlative deployments with mirrors (it is in the poster!), shadows, shades (Tony's silhouette hiding behind the shower curtain during a hide-and-seek) and sublime focus-alteration, refracted by the B&W prism, the potency is mind-blowing and soul-cleansing, up to the very end, the transcendent oddity of the situation could only pique one's curiosity for more, for the imbroglio is so fascinating, so nihilistic, anticipates A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (1971, 8/10)'s benumbing ridicule.John Dankworth's alternately light-mood, lyric, jazz-infused and riveting score is a handsome companion to Pinter's satirical and pun-slinging screenplay (under the weather? poncho and gaucho?), when Tony addresses to Susan that he (Barrett) looks like a fish, it hits the bull's eye. Bogarde continues his bold glass-ceiling-breaking endeavor after VICTIM (1961, 8/10), bags another self-revealing role and unleashes his nefarious audacious in the duality of Barrett's servant-and-master changeover; while his on-screen prey James Fox, who, indeed, is equally brilliant in this breakthrough picture, out of four main characters, none of them are good- natured, but he is the only one can collect viewers' sympathy, and one may not root for him, but witness his downfall nevertheless needs more than the fondness of his willowy figure and innocent eyes. Miles and Craig, the two female companions, can not receive the same laud, Miles has a strident voice and being excruciatingly annoying whenever she talks and her performance is in excess of theatricality, which luckily would tune down in her later effort in RYAN'S DAUGHTER (1970, 7/10) and THE HIRELING (1973, 6/10); Craig, whose snobbish and frigid poise is off-putting, albeit she has the most recondite sensibilities to present in the frenzied coda, the efficacy is beyond her ken.THE SERVANT may be Losey's finest work and should be appreciated more, it is a divine psychological drama with a latent homosexual struggle which perpetually beleaguers human nature and finally we reach the opportune time when we can look directly into each other's eyes without feeling ashamed or offensive anymore.

It has made at least one person want to take a cleansing shower after watching it. Two, in fact. Another person is left with a creepy, nasty feeling; although they also seem to think it excellent. It's very obviously well-constructed, cunning, subtle and clever.Bogarde slips into his slimy character's skin so perfectly that it fits him like a glove. He first appears on the doorstep as a sort of neo-vampire, setting out to suck his hapless victim dry, and strip him of every shred of dignity. A major flaw in this scenario is that the James Fox character has so little dignity to start with. It is neither moving nor instructive to see an utterly useless self-deluding nonentity reduced from nowhere to nothing. In fact, it is distasteful, off-putting and even disgusting.My disc came with an extra feature in the form of a wordy talk by a man called Ian Christie, described as Director AHRB for British Film, and who is also, as may be discovered from his devotedly self-regarding fansite, Professor of Film and Media History at Birkbeck, University of London. He comes up with some interesting, but also frequently trite and banal, remarks about this film. He doesn't, however, seem to have a firm grip of his subject. For instance, he presents a photograph of three men in a row, labelled James Fox, Joseph Losey and a third called Dick (sic) Bogarde. The man shown as Dick (sic) Bogarde is actually Harold Pinter, author of at least one great script, called The Caretaker.Then Christie refers to an otherwise unknown American actor called Rock Hunter, saying Imagine if Rock Hunter had played a part like the one played by Bogarde? I imagine he would have been successful. After that, Christie says (twice) that the first film directed by Dick Lester with the Beatles was called Help, 1965. Some of us, not film professors, thought it was A Hard Day's Night, 1964. In that film a man on a train from Liverpool to London is mocked for having fought in WW2. Christie thinks this happened in Help. Someone at Studio Canal might have helped Christie with the text of his feature before sending it out to the world.For the record, the actor Dirk Bogarde's real name was Sir Derek Jules Gaspard Ulric Niven van den Bogaerde. A man with a name like that deserves several servants. The Beatles were a forgettable pop group, accurately described by Cassius Clay, who met them just before his sensational and memorable 1964 defeat of Sonny Liston, as a bunch of little sissies.Christie points out, what most viewers recognise, that there is a semi-submerged homosexual sub-text to The Servant. Among the puzzles posed by this movie is how a world so often described as gay could consist of such deeply depressing misery. Presumably because its gaiety is diagnosed as repressed. The servant also acts as a nanny to his enfeebled employer, dosing him with what looks like Dr Collis Browne's medical compound of laudanum, cannabis and chloroform. The film should evoke a response from homophobes, a word not only etymologically specious and incorrect, but also demonstrating political incorrectness.If I weren't so sickened and repelled by the whole performance, I'd give it more stars than seven.

Perhaps it's because I've seen better evil performances by Dirk Bogarde (Cast a Giant Shadow comes to mind). Or, perhaps it's because I felt that the plot didn't quite hit the mark. Yes, I think it's mostly the latter. The transition from a seemingly loyal servant to a weird dominant pal seemed odd--and very, very difficult to believe. I really think this COULD have worked had they been very daring and made the relationship between the rich guy and the servant a homosexual one--it would have much better explained WHY the bizarre juxtaposition occurred. As it is, there is no competent explanation for this change in positions from servant to eventual master. Had the gay subtext been able to been explored openly, I think the film would have made a lot of sense and been more realistic.

Sarah Miles is rather alluring as Bogarde's pawn; a good performance of jittery ebullience. The look at the class system is effective, but the film is enjoyable on plenty of levels. Audience sympathy doesn't come into it - Fox is ineffectual, indolent and never really likeable, while Bogarde veers from falsely charming to downright sinister.

He hires Hugo Barrett, who is not only good at his job, but very correct in his manners and confident in his abilities. Tony, however, doesn't have much personal strength, and often needs advice and leaves decisions about the house to Barrett. This gives Barrett power, so much that he supplants Tony as the true master of the house, leaving Tony in demise.The plot description opens up for very interesting possibilities. I envisioned a psychological power struggle between Tony and Barrett, a struggle that slowly shifted from Tony to Barrett. Unfortunately, the character Tony is far too weak compared to Barrett, and thus the shift is very quickly. And when it comes it goes very quickly. Instead focus is put on the introduction and the part leading up to the shift. That is very important if the power struggle is going to have any meaning, but in my opinion, is given too much time. The result was too much time waiting, and a feeling of everything being rushed when the struggle should take place. I'm not at all that impressed of the writing as many others seem to be, even though Harold Pinter is the man behind the pen. I had hoped for a much equal battle where the outcome is more unclear. Now Tony doesn't seem to realize he is in a battle at all.The acting is good, especially from Dirk Bogarde that plays Barrett, but this is not enough to carry the entire movie. Being somewhat of a classic with good ratings I had hoped for more, especially with Bogarde, Pinter and Lousey behind it. Good acting, some nice cinematic details but in all nothing to live up to the expectations.Unfortunately, the end did not much to salvage the movie either. I don't need a Hollywood ending, nor a happy one at all. But this just left too much hanging.

As such the novel has succumbed to a Pintersque agenda. This agenda is underpinned by a requisite to illustrate the ambiguity of class, and class relationships. The servant character here is representative of a proletariat desire to become bourgeoisie, an ambition emanating from jealousy, as opposed to the well documented and discussed agenda of control. This emergence of the proletariat's aspirations to become bourgeoisie has served to undermine the 'assumed' Marxist agenda to overthrow the the ruling class and take control of the means of production.But in order to become bourgeoisie Bogarte's character, representing the proletariat must undermine his ruler in a controlling fashion. He then must maintain control in order to own all to himself, a slice of the bourgeoisie cake, which the latter have become apparently arrogantly complacent about as represented by Fox's character.Fox plays off Bogarte who holds the viewer's attention throughout. As such, The Servant becomes a show-case for Bogarte's acting ability. His ability to utilise the vernacular of a northern working-class man, and show him as the threat to the bourgeoisie is inspiring to say the least. Moreover, Bogarte's ability to camp it up distorts our narrow, given pre-conceived ideas of the working-class machismo. He extrapolates from this acting ability to play controversial, intense roles such as his lead as the character Gustav Von Aschenbach in Death in Venice (1971). Likewise he was equally intense albeit in a different format as the character Tom Riley in The Blue Lamp (1950).On the other hand, Wendy Craig's character is currently undermined by her ing√©nue, middle-class matriarchal roles in mediocre sit-coms. As such it's difficult to take Craig seriously in her menacing role in The Servant.Meanwhile, the nourish direction of the film is very atmospheric, which lends to the tension of characters, and the story in general.In sum, a film with many levels to it, so worth watching with a close, critical eye.

It is also on Cahiers du Cinema's Top Ten list for 1964 (although it premiered here in the US one week or so before the JFK assassination). So with such a rather distinguished pedigree I was curious and decided to check it out.Since we're talking about a film over a half century old, let's get some context out of the way. I myself am 56 years old, and I get the whole crumbling class distinctions that was so revolutionary and trenchant for the time. Ditto on the sexual tides churning and turning right before the whole Mod Carnaby St. trend hit two years later. So even before the movie started, I was ready to give this independent film some props for being prescient and taking on adult issues of social import. I soon discovered that the cinematography is great, and Losey's direction is very dynamic even given the mostly claustrophobic surroundings.The only problem is there is not one likable character in this movie. They are all grotesque in one way or another, like Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio. Tony (James Fox) is an effete upper class twit, Hugo Barrett, the titular servant played by Dirk Bogarde, is a smoldering cauldron of class resentment and spiteful subterranean shenanigans, Susan (Wendy Craig), is Tony's bitchy and frigid girlfriend, Vera (Susan Miles), is a two-faced slut, etc. You get the idea.Granted the plot line was ripe with possibilities (you surely know what it is by now if you've read this far down the thread), but the execution here is wanting. The characters, being so grotesque, aren't very believable. Nicholas Roeg would take the same basic idea and do it much better with Performance a few years later, and that film has aged a lot better in my humble opinion.So what if this film was all the rage in 1963; here in 2015, it's just a dreary pretentious bore. It looks great, the performances are substantive, but the themes have been done to death and The Servant no longer surprises and just doesn't carry that much dramatic weight anymore. There are literally dozens of films that are much older than this that I find exciting to watch again, but I'll never bother torturing myself with this dated dinosaur.But if you're a British art house stuff completest, by all means, check it out; it is an historically important film in that regard.

Later in the story the servant brings his own woman into Tony's house. Romantic entanglements ensue.A onetime viewing was about all I could take of this excruciatingly pointless movie. Tony is representative of the idle rich; he needs to be pampered. He is also weak-willed, and the entire story hinges on that characteristic. Melodrama erupts from assorted household incidents that could have easily been resolved if Tony were a stronger person.The B&W visuals are fine, and indeed are the best part of the film. One scene is shot from a high angle, overlooking a winding stairway. The resultant image conveys a visual expression tantamount to contortion. A jazzy score, combined with the photography, renders an early 1960's mod look and feel. Viewers understand that characters here are hip sophisticates, fully attuned to an avant-garde lifestyle. But this same impression likewise makes them cold and unsympathetic.Given the somewhat claustrophobic household environment, the plot structure is rather subtle, with plot points that turn on small details. Attempts to move the plot outside the house are not very successful. A sequence at a restaurant could have been left out entirely, as it is irrelevant to the overall story.I suppose that the film's theme of individual power play and control is enough to captivate a lot of viewers. But because the characters are cold, stick-like mannequins lacking depth, I could not get interested in their vanities or their petty problems. For me, The Servant was dull and pointless.

No, time has passed. It's 1963, not 1933 and Dirk Bogarde only play acts at the role of a trustworthy, honest, hard working, loyal servant to his master Lord Darlington--no sorry, just plain Tony (James Fox). And Tony is no aristocratic fool, coddling up to the Nazis. No, Tony, just back from Africa, fancies himself a kind of playboy of the Western World, one who wants all the amenities which a Lord Darlington might expect, without a lot of the discipline involved in maintaining the stern, fair, above-it-all image. And, he thinks that he's gotten quite the good deal by hiring Hugo. After all, Hugo seems the connoisseur of all that is important, to be an excellent servant to an equally excellent, modern, gentleman  he can cook, clean and take care of all those petty details of daily life, like interior decoration. Hugo sees Tony and Tony looks back and gives his commands. Time passes and,the master gets his recognition through an other consciousness, for in them the latter affirms itself as unessential, both by working upon the thing, and, on the other hand, by the fact of being dependent on a determinate existence; in neither case can this other get the mastery over existence, and succeed in absolutely negating it. We have thus here this moment of recognition, viz. that the other consciousness cancels itself as self-existent, and, ipso facto, itself does what the first does to it. In the same way we have the other moment, that this action on the part of the second is the action proper of the first; for what is done by the bondsman is properly an action on the part of the master. The latter exists only for himself, that is his essential nature; he is the negative power without qualification, a power to which the thing is naught. And he is thus the absolutely essential act in this situation, while the bondsman is not so, he is an unessential activity. But for recognition proper there is needed the moment that what the master does to the other he should also do to himself, and what the bondsman does to himself, he should do to the other also. On that account a form of recognition has arisen that is one-sided and unequal.PHENOMENOLOGY OF THE SPIRIT, by G.W.F. HegelTony's intended, Susan (Wendy Craig) is a bit miffed by Hugo&#150;he seems to be moving in on her prerogatives. And he is. Hugo is busy drawing Tony into a dependency structure which will eventuate in a veritable proletarian revolution in the household. In fact, that's what the servant is all about  the power dynamics which occur between classes, between masters and servants. Eventually Susan is replaced by Vera (Sarah Miles), Hugo's lover, who is deceptively brought into the master's household as Hugo's sister, a maid needing a position. And, to be sure, Tony puts her in various positions. The dependency trap is all but sealed. Political power is being put into reverse....It's always an interesting stage setting when you have a household with masters and servants because The Servant like Remains of the Day, in effect, reflects everyday employer/employee social relations of class society....the society we live in. Lina Wertm√ºller did it again in her 1974 film, Swept Away. The good news is that ALL THESE FILMS ARE EXCELLENT! Any way you look at it, the reality of class relations are there. And that reality is compounded by the fact that the actual people portrayed in The Servant (or the other two films mentioned) who are members of these two classes are not cardboard cut-out versions of their stereotypes. Nor are they heroic or extraordinarily nice, artistic, moral, or any of a number of things, one might expect in say a film produced for the Disney Corporation. What's being exposed is not the existence of angels and demons, but the essence and possible consequences of power in societies based on dominance and submission. "},{"Title":"Extremely slow.

The bell tower is also often heard during the film, although the reason for this is a bit hard to deduce. The acting on behalf of both Bogarde and Fox is great. Bogarde manages to carry something sinister to his character at all times, and Fox is the perfect choice to play a na√Øve, corruptible young man. Other than these mentioned points however, the film has little to hold it up. By all means the story is intriguing but in the second half it spirals out in a number of haphazard directions, with little consistency in the events, and if there is any message at all, or any real story to it, this does not come across. There is definitely something in the two male leads' relationship, but the film refuses to say what, instead just showing only how they interact, and rather messily at that. However, the weakest point of the production lies with the characters. Since none of them are likable, there is no place for one to invest sympathies, and some characters, like the bishop played by Patrick Magee, are introduced quite significantly despite never appearing again. All the characters other than the main four are in fact quite useless. The idea behind the film is sort of fascinating, and that is what keeps it driving the whole way through. There are a number of good elements to be found here, but overall, there is too much that just doesn't work out for the film to rate as anything better than above average. It worth a look, as most experimental type films are, but it just misses the mark somewhere.

What is skillful is how the movie begins with a very classic English atmosphere; SO very trite and proper that it almost seems like in the Victorian age until the relationship with the servant becomes more and more strained and the movie develops an edgy offbeat sleazy feel to it, clearly emulating the contrast of how APPEARANCES were of English society at this time, and much of what was taking place in the shade.*The Following is an in-depth analysis of the plot which may be spoiled*After the servant is thrown out, for overstepping his territory, and lying that his fianc√© was his sister, given the way the movie had been developing, in that the servant deliberately staged for his fianc√© to have sex with his master, (or at least didn't care) and to infringe upon his territory, while all the while, keeping a very strong presence himself (redecorating the house, arranging things to his will, and even spending night in his fianc√©'s who is supposed to be his sisters room) until ultimately being caught having sex in his master's bed chamber, we say to ourselves... ok... so was he PLANNING something? ... and what was the point of all this behaviour, when essentially any servant behaving this way would get thrown out and never taken back in 99% of cases.Needless to say, by absolute chance the master meets the servant at a nearby bar, something impossible for any planning person to presuppose, and my point would be there are too many mindless movies with so called calculating and cunning evildoers, who's plans are revealed to involve presupposed outcomes or incidents that just HAPPEN to occur in the plot just to get in their lame little plot twist. Therefore let us ASSUME this movie isn't one of those and that nothing at all was planned, which now puts heavy question on what the servant had intended in the first place by being so overtly disobedient to get himself thrown out after a short time; something not impossible though highly unusual and needing SOME sort of explanation if at least a comment of i've been a servant all my life, and now I'm sick of it and want to make a joke of the upper class. in talking to his fianc√©.Anyhow, The servant begs his forgiveness and asks to be taken back, saying that his fianc√© left him and not only deceived the master but both of them, whereby he IS taken back, and quite instantly HE in essence becomes the new master of the house, becoming overtly overbearing and nagging. At this stage in terms of character development, the master becomes more and more yielding, seeming to shake off his stuffy old world upper class mannerisms, feeling compelled to the servant's more brutish low class behaviour; the 2 even playing ball games in the hallway and breaking things, both always drunk, the servant arranging wild parties. It is as if the master can finally release his tension and be a kid and have wild fun that perhaps he missed out on when he was younger. Does the master even have a job? The viewer comes to ask if his talks of work on reforestation was merely boasting about nothing. all of this is strange and perverse, unlikely, yet it seems plausible. If there is any message in this film it was about the changing times of English society. Let me say that anyone who has taken there to be ANYTHING semblant of homosexuality in this movie, is mentally deranged, as there is not the slightest hint or comment of ANY love or romance between the 2 men, physical or verbal. Only metrosexuals with a homophobic complex would even think of that.The role reversal is very interesting but to me it simply went too far near the end where the master's girlfriend who had also left him, comes back to find her lover in a drunken state with obnoxious party guests around. Here the servant's fianc√© also returns and soon the servant orders everyone to leave including his master's girlfriend, without any interference from him. The movie ends as the servant retires to his masters bedroom to be met with a woman who looks like his fianc√© but we can't really make her out.This movie is a failure because it doesn't answer simple important questions that any strong plot should, such as was it all planned from the beginning or not and if so why? Did the servants fianc√© really dump him and only LATER return or not? If so then she returned to see the master, not the servant, as for all she knew he was thrown out, so who then did she truly love? Most importantly, was it his fianc√© who he went up to meet and did they truly only just settle their differences that night, and why are we not allowed to see the most important part of the movie of WHO IS IT that is waiting in the masters room, that the servant goes to meet. In the end the whole thing is too ambiguous and gives the audience little credit, but still worth watching for anyone interested in mindfuck movies in general.

Puhleaze! Bogarde is boooooring as a man-servant/major domo with a MAJOR chip on his fragile shoulders. His plan is to make subtle class-warfare on an upright Englishman. I guess that is a smart premise, but then the film doesn't support the dramatic thesis it puts out there. His employer has done absolutely nothing to trigger a power struggle and they have no previous history. Bogarde's character is socio-pathetic and revels in his ability to inflict misery on others his own girl friend Vera and his employer's fianc√©e. That's the entire film in a nutshell. I viewed this three times to decipher the message in the confusing narrative and have come to the conclusion that... even the likes of Harold Pinter strikes out now and then. This is an example. "},{"Title":"Over the Top, Tedious, Ill-Thought Out Grand Guignol Melodrama","Date":"29 October 2003","Score":"5 out of 22 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  I'd seen the movie before, but wondered if I'd like it any better on a  fresh viewing. Nope. First, from the start, the story is told at a great distance. We are never close to any of the characters, don't ever feel we know them very well. I can understand why we're not to know about the Bogarde and Miles characters - because that's the big secret the film intends to reveal later - but there's no reason for us not to have a better idea of the Tony character. E.g., is there a project on which he's involved in Brazil? Is this person a great success as an engineer? We don't doubt it at the beginning - but later behavior tends to cause us to doubt it. It's critical to understand the evolution to know who this guy has been - and we don't get it.Second, the characters keep contradicting themselves in their behavior. Thus, e.g., we see a swaggering and insolent Bogarde and Miles when they are caught out - then a (presumably) humble and penitent Bogarde in the pub - then in the very next scene a Bogarde acting more outrageously than ever. So why would Fox react any differently to this outrageous Bogarde than he had earlier? No explanation. Same with Miles. We see her leave in distress late in the movie - having failed to move Fox to give her any money - in the next scene she's at a party at his home. HUH?Third, does Tony have no friends, no outside world whatever, no relatives - how can he be so entrapped? No explanation. It's one thing to have Grand Guignol where someone is actually imprisoned - even by disability as in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? (which this movie is most like), but it's another where the person has immense resources of friends, contacts and money.  Fourth, the movie is confusing about how much was planned and how much was left spontaneous regarding the Bogarde/Miles behavior. Time after time, they do things that are inconsistent with any plan. Moreover, if there was a plan, their whole behavior was stopped, they were out - and then somehow we see Tony's complete collapse -- without explanation of his change of behavior.Fifth, this movie just crawls.Sixth, the movie takes the pernicious view that forgiveness of an apparently penitent person equals weakness and leads to immediate moral degradation. I would actually think the opposite.Seventh, the movie's idea that utter moral corruption is best illustrated by a bachelor kissing an older woman in black at a party at his home with loud music playing - is hilarious. The whole party scene at the end of the movie is so absurd, the scary music so over the top, that, as one reviewer here mentioned, the movie is very funny when meaning to be most serious.Eighth, the movie as a whole is so over the top throughout in its portents of gloom and doom that one can only think that Pinter and Losey wanted to have a good time portraying someone from the upper class going to pieces.Ninth, we're given no reason to think why Tony would be drawn to Wendy Craig's character. His mix of bluff innocence and extreme good looks simply don't mesh with her suspicious nature and pinched homely looks. There is no magnetism whatever between them at any time - yet we're meant to believe they're engaged. This is a bad movie made for sensation, without any plausible message except that people do succumb to temptation. Well... yeah, people do. But for Tony to go from a wealthy handsome man with apparently big plans in the world to crawling jibbering idiot, we need more than an obstreperous manservant and the revelation of the master's infidelity with a servant girl. Moreover, since we don't know Tony at all, we don't care much about his downfall, and don't understand why in one scene we're seeing a man forgive another - and in the next, we're meant to think of complete degradation.A bad movie.
