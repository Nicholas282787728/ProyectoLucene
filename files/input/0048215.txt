Giant shrews, ants, spiders, dinosaurs and whatnot scared audiences and were immensely popular throughout the world. For example, THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS (1953) clearly led to Japanese films such as Godzilla (1954) and its many spin-offs. In general, these films were super-cheesy--having pretty second-rate special effects (even for the time) and lousy dialog. Godzilla was a guy in a reptile suit, TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE used a lobster and THE KILLER SHREWS used hairy costumes placed on dogs--all very high on the cheese-o-meter. However, a very small number of these films did have decent special effects for the time period and tried to be serious entertainment--and IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA is one of them.Unlike many giant monster films, IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA looked like it had a larger budget. Much of this was because they had the cooperation of the navy and because they used GOOD stock footage--not the usual grainy and irrelevant filler used in many of these films. It also looked big budget because of the work of Ray Harryhausen. Now, in the 21st century, his work appears rather crude and old fashioned, but for the mid-1950s it was state of the art and still holds up reasonably well if you aren't an idiot who expects CG and state of the art effects. Sure, the giant octopus looks a bit odd and is obviously controlled through stop-motion, but it is very well integrated into the scenes and still impresses. It's obvious that they really cared and wanted to make a quality picture.As far as the romance and dialog goes, I will admit it has a lot of clichés--such as the brainy but sexy female scientist. However, it was handled a bit better than usual and at least Faith Domergue (a perennial in 50s sci-fi) was pleasant looking. I know it's weird, but I really get turned on by the brainy scientists in these film. In fact, I married one myself--though she has no experience, so far, with giant monsters! Don't worry folks--I showed this review to my wife and I am NOT in the dog house!For lovers of the genre, this film is a must. For those who think giant monsters attacking mankind are stupid, then at least one is better than most of the rest!!

The octopus is quite stunning and a marvel of stop-motion animation.  Viewers are treated to it actually climbing on the Golden Gate Bridge(a model of course), squeezing a submarine, literally bringing a ship down to the depths, and throwing tentacles all over pedestrians in the San Francisco harbour.  My only regret is that this is all too infrequent and most of it arriving at the end of the film.  The rest of the story centers around Kenneth Tobey, Faith Domerge and Donald Curtis trying to discover what it is that held Tobey's submarine.  There is also a weird love triangle among the three as well which enhances the story I believe.  All in all this is a fine piece of classic science fiction entertainment.

Eventually after a considerable struggle, they do escape and later discover that what had held them down was in fact a giant Octopus!From scientists Dr. John Carter (Donald Curtis) & Dr. Leslie Joyce (Faith Domergue), working along with the military's Commander Matthews, we learn that this Octopus has undergone an atomic mutation and has now come to prey on man instead of fish and is all set to ravage the West Coast of America. Eventually it surfaces and attacks the Golden Gate Bridge while San Francisco panics in fear! Can It be stopped? The real star of this film is Harryhausen's Giant Octopus, who even with only six tentacles, manages to make a more lasting impression on the viewer than most of the cast. That said, the theme of feminism is also an important undercurrent of this story and I felt Faith Domergue did a wonderful job with what she was given to work with. The moments she coaxes the trans-steamer survivor into admitting it was a giant Octopus that attacked his ship is a great one for her. While this movie is much too slow getting to its eventual pay-off for most viewers, it's never bothered me as much because I felt Domergue and Tobey had a great chemistry on screen together and I actually liked the addition of their romance here. Still this has to be one of the first disaster films really considering how a giant Octopus nearly does in San Francisco...and well that's a cool and fun premise for a movie in my book (even if one does have to swallow one's disbelief).

One of the answers was large screen special effects and this film was one of the best in that department.Ray Harryhausen's name so far is still the only special effects man that I know who's name will actually encourage people to buy a movie ticket. He created some marvelous film monsters and this was one of his best.The octopus we are told comes from the Mindinao Deep, a spot on our planet still not totally explored because it is the deepest part of our ocean's bottoms. Presumably there are a whole lot more like him around and in point of fact to this day we don't know all the creatures of the sea. That perennial villain of Fifties Science fiction, atomic testing and/or radiation has made this big guy move out of the depths and try to capture Captain Kenneth Tobey's submarine. He barely gets away and Tobey's is the first of several incidents involving the creature. Scientists Faith Domergue and Donald Curtis are also on the job and the creature ends up in San Francisco Bay. He does a number on the Golden Gate bridge and then tries to beach himself at the Embarcadero. Army flame throwers see that doesn't happen.Faith Domergue was a really beautiful woman who became known again through the Howard Hughes biographical film, The Aviator. She was at one time Hughes's main squeeze. This is probably the film she's most known for though. There's one scene where Domergue uses her best asset to convince a merchant seaman whose ship has been sunk by the octopus, but is afraid of being given a section 8, to fess up about the monster. Kind of campy, but fun.The monster's no villain here as in some films. He's just a creature whose habitat man has disturbed that's trying to survive. Unfortunately we can't have him roaming the Pacific destroying all kinds of civilian and military activity. So he has to be killed. For me it was a bit sad seeing the outcome. I think other viewers will feel the same way.

Hell we even had giant water snails laying slimy waste to all in their way. But what of the ocean? So much potential down there. Rhedosaurus and Gojira had come from the sea to lay a marker down for the big lizard, but what of the natural creatures? Sharks? Well Spielberg's genre daddy was some 20 years away. Whales? Crabs?

Starring Faith Domergue (This Island Earth), Kenneth Tobey (The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms) and Donald Curtis (Earth vs. The Flying Saucers), it has safe and solid genre credentials. Though guilty of being over talky, in that the science being offered up isn't worthy of such meanderings, the script does allow for a feminism angle that should be applauded for the time it was made. Even if it's almost smothered by the love tryst shenanigans of our three central players that is. Filmed on location in San Francisco to add some level of authenticity to the story and having a running time that doesn't let it outstay its welcome.

The Harryhausen effects are great, the narrative follows a course of some scientific logic and Faith Domergue, if a little too old, looks good enough in her tight blouse.Director Robert Gordon did little else of note which is surprising - he did a good enough job here and whilst not up to the standard of '20 Million Miles to Earth' (1957), 'It Came from Beneath the Sea' is still superior for its type.BEST SCENE - no contest; the octopus trashing the Golden Gate Bridge.

They conclude that the submarine was attacked by a giant radioactive octopus developed from bombing tests in the Pacific Ocean that would threaten the oceans. The Navy Command does not accept the explanation, but when a ship is sunk by the octopus, they realize the menace. Cmdr. Mathews teams-up with Carter and Joyce and has a love affair with her. But soon the monster attacks San Francisco and the trio is the only chance to stop the creature.It Came from Beneath the Sea is a weak sci-fi about an abyssal octopus, fruit of bomb tests in the ocean. I am a big fan of Sci-Fi's from the 50 's, but this one is too dated, military and lame. The story takes place after WWII and during the Cold War in a period when the military people were in the summit of their careers; but there are many others good movies from this period. The greatest problem is the lack of action, with the romance without any chemistry between Pete and Joyce with John Carter with them all the time in a total waste of time. The period of research is also too long. The stop-motion effects are OK for a 1955 film. The good point is Prof. Lesley Joyce, a woman ahead of time with her independence and not fainting or screaming like most of the heroins from the 50's and 60's movies.

I got It Came & Earth vs. 2-Discs they are really awesome! & have the movies remastered in Hi-Def with 5.1 Surround why didn't 20 Million have 5.1 Surround? oh well. I love the colorized versions for both films & the technology has improved & looks much better then the 80's Colorizing Process like done to King Kong which looked awful.

Having rewatched it, I have to admit that it's perhaps the least of his film accomplishments.Once again, the atomic bomb provides the justification for another giant monster, though, despite what has been inaccurately reported elsewhere, the octopus in the film has not been mutated by radiation. It's simply a very large example of its kind that was living at the bottom of a deep ocean trench. When atomic testing made it radioactive, it couldn't effectively hunt because other sea creatures could somehow sense its presence. Therefore, it came to the surface in search of food.One of the major problems with this film is that while an octopus makes a decent giant monster, it completely lacks the personality of some of Harryhausen's other creatures. Furthermore, it is confined to the sea--and, by extension, the shoreline--limiting its ability to go on a proper rampage.Even at 79 minutes, the film moves very slowly until the climax. The opening sequence, in which the beast attacks a submarine captained by Kenneth Tobey's character, goes on for several very long minutes of inconsequential naval dialogue.The lethargic pacing extends to the plot as well. The team of scientists assigned to determine what attacked the sub take a full two weeks to identify it as an octopus.An odd love triangle of sorts pads the running time. Faith Domergue--who is presented as a modern feminist despite her tendency to scream on cue--seems just as interested in Tobey's navy man as she does in her fellow scientist. The two men acknowledge the triangle, but neither seems at all competitive about it.Domergue is one of the best things about the film. She's credible as both scientist and sweater gal, and is a good example of the increasing role of female characters in science-fiction films of the period.Once the octopus attacks in earnest, things pick up quite a bit, and Harryhausen's effects--including stop-motion-animated building demolition--are quite effective. While this is definitely a lesser effort for him, he still shows what he can do with a small budget and a relatively uninteresting monster.

Actually, it's Curtis, a man, who states that case for the new woman, though Domergue's aggressive scientist makes a convincing case all by herself. Surprisingly for this type movie, the three share equal time on screen, and it's pretty clear director Gordon's instructions to them are to low-key it, which they do to good effect.The first atomic submarine, the Nautilus, sailed in mid-1954 to a lot of public interest. No doubt, the producers here were well aware, and wove a crowd-pleasing story around the film version. Then too, mutant monsters had not yet taken over movie screens as they would a few years later. No doubt, the success of this film was parent to many of those creature offspring. Anyway, as these movies go, this is definitely one of the better ones in all departments, (though a couple of romantic scenes could have been easily economized).In passing&#x97;I really like that last scene where our three musketeers get no recognition for their heroics.

The Navy call on the knowledge of marine scientists/biologists Professor John Carter(Donald Curtis), renowned as the essential mind in his field, and Professor Lesley Joyce(Faith Domergue, whose sex appeal is well established in this flick)an up and coming authority in the study of aquatic life, to study the tissue so that an answer can be provided as to what the submarine encountered. They soon discover, as missing fisherman have already, that an enormous octopus, living in the extreme depths of the ocean, was disturbed by H-bomb testing with the radioactivity breeding an insatiable hunger for human or large animal life, leading to it's submerging to the surface in search of food. The scientists will assist Mathews and the Navy in a search for the octopus after it attacks a steamer in Canadian waters and a family driving along an Oregon beach. Closing the North Pacific in search for the marine monster, the Navy will race against time in the hopes of finding it as other countries in the surrounding areas grow restless with the secrecy of why their businesses are being effected. But, matters will only grow worse as the octopus sets it's sights on San Francisco..Despite the love-triangle melodrama between Mathews, Joyce and Carter which develops as they seek the monster, and a narrative device used to spoon-feed the viewer(..as was often the case in the 50's), this is quite an entertaining little creature feature thanks to Harryhausen magic. The aquatic beast exposes it's massive tentacles as it destroys a portion of Golden Gate Bridge, ripping to shreds a clock tower, breaking into a store window, reaching into the streets as frightened civilians scurry for escape, grappling a steamer before pulling it underwater, and getting it's skin penetrated by a specially made warhead(patterned after a harpoon is encased in the nose;instead of exploding on contact it is designed to penetrate the flesh, by means of spreading barbs, the warhead will be set off electronically). The monster even surfaces on the coast of an Oregon embankment to grab a victim and holds Mathews' submarine hostage before he and Carter attempt to hurt it with explosives. Harryhausen's monster is the real star, but the leads have good chemistry and the screenplay plucks from the topic of the time, a villain of our own creation being the H-bombs we experiment with through explosions, to give the audience a reason for why it is attacking us(..not to mention making a statement about the dangers of radiation). Good fun. Tobey is always a welcome presence as the heroic, no-nonsense, man-in-charge, who you find believable as the one others trust as a leader when facing a crisis, needing the type of commander who can think on his feet. It's hard, though, to compete with those Harryhausen tentacles which rise from the watery depths to snatch terrified on-lookers..

I might have blown this one too but thanks to DVR, even nodding off would have had a remedy.The first thing I noticed here was that the black and white transfer I viewed on Turner Classics was phenomenally crisp and offered a first rate viewing experience. Ray Harryhausen's monster effects and the film makers' stop motion wizardry really brought a level of sophistication to this otherwise B grade sci-fi/horror film. Granted, the action isn't what modern day viewers would expect given the prevalence of CGI, but for the mid-Fifties, this was pretty cool.But you know, the picture had it's share of goofs too, and it's the kind of stuff I live for with these old pictures. Remember when the airplane pilot spotted the pair of survivors in the rubber dinghy after the sailors abandoned ship during the first attack? When the scene transitions to the naval hospital, there are four men brought in! Then this next scene, I had to wonder whether it was intentional or not because it was just so ironic. In the lab where the scientists and Commander Pete Matthews (Kenneth Tobey) are working, there's a prominently displayed sign that says 'No Smoking', but the commander spends his entire time taking drags on his cigarette.But the one that really doubled me over was when Commander Matthews and Professor Joyce (Faith Domergue) are on the beach investigating the latest missing person headline, and the professor explains to the Admiral that the potential sea monster probably hasn't gone away from the area. Yet she and the commander are out in the ocean swimming!Well if you can take your sci-fi with a grain of sea salt, this is probably one of the better giant mutant due to atomic radiation flicks you're likely to come up with from the era. The octopus attack on the Golden Gate Bridge was a pretty creative affair, and if you're going to make a stand for humanity, you might as well have the movie heroes blow the monster all to hell with an explosive torpedo.

But this squid with the giant plunger like suckers on his tentacles (which left manhole sized marks on the sandy beaches of the Pacific Coast) could literally climb up out of the ocean, hugging the Embarcadero and reaching his tentacles far down Market Street to cause all sort of disaster. Considering that MacDonald's character might have been only in her early 80's when the event with the octopus occurred, she very well could have witnessed it, and as the rubble fell, screamed, Oh no, not again! This is a very enjoyable science fiction monster movie, a product of the nuclear age and a reminder of what real life science might be capable of. Faith Domergue, once the protégée of Howard Hughes during his executive years as head of RKO, is a very intelligent scientist working with the military on the obvious presence of something lurking under the sea. Kenneth Tobey is the Navy commander she strikes up a friendship with, and fortunately, the romantic element of the movie is underplayed as Domergue is seriously a 50's career woman, still beautiful and desirable, but determined to find a way to stop this beast with eight tentacles before she deals with the beast with two arms.She explains this isn't the first case of a giant octopus coming out of the sea, having found evidence of such creatures back in the 14th century off the coast of Denmark after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. It's obvious that these creatures lie dormant in the outer reaches of the ocean floor, only rising when disturbed. This monster makes a dramatic entrance, taking down a raised submarine and pretty much killing the entire crew. Those who laugh at its possible existence end up regretting it (if they live to remember it), and those driving down California State Highway 480 will surely get a visual to remember, if they make it past Market Street.Excellent special effects make this one of the best of the nuclear age science fiction monster movies with decent performances and a brisk pace. It isn't nearly as good as 20 Million Miles to Earth which humanized the monster, but it is still gripping. Who will ever forget the octopus coming out of the sea and revealing not only its tentacles but its huge head as it prepares to destroy a submarine, its sudden appearance on the beach and its efforts to take down the Golden Gate Bridge before it makes its way over to the Embarcadero. San Francisco has had many car chase movies and several films about its different shake-ups, but to see something of this size taking down some of the most famous west coast tourist attractions is a wonderful movie memory to cherish and to enthrall science fiction fans for decades to come.

Major corporations saw the power nuclear energy could provide, so the industrialization of factories and transportation started with a boom. But along with this, came some nasty side effects thanks to the radiation nuclear energy gave off. So to lightly emphasize the issue and capitalize on the topic, a set of films began to be created. Out of this bunch, was the most popular, Godzilla (1954). But there are others that have credibility to them as well and just aren't recognized for that talent. This is one of them.After a strange run in with a mysterious ocean creature, an American Sub Commander Pete Matthews (Kenneth Tobey), decides to find out for himself what he possibly ran into. The plot device - after series of nuclear bombing tests in the west Pacific Ocean, the radiation mutated a gentle sea octopus into a human eating, town-destroying monster. So it is obvious that there really isn't much else. The writer, George Worthing Yates did his best with the screenplay. He's also the writer of the classic sci-fi film Them! (1954). But what Yates didn't accomplish here is telling its audience who is with who. Commander Matthews befriends two scientists - Prof. Joyce (Faith Domergue) & Dr. Carter (Donald Curtis). Both men seem to be attracted to Prof. Joyce but it's never explained to whether who's dating the girl. Why is it important? Because the topic of romance is touched up on right when the characters meet, so apparently there was a story to be told - it just wasn't evidently told to the audience. Almost like it was swept under the rug. But if that was the case, why bring it up to begin with? There's also the fact of a reporter bringing up a good point on the octopus. He asks if there are anymore and the consensus was that no one knew. Well gee, that's kind of important because I'm pretty sure no one wants to rebuild a city more than once in a year! That's where Mr. Yates fails at his writing. Anything else is acceptable though because it is science fiction, so any explanation can be made to why the octopus became bloodthirsty.The actors themselves give good shows. Kenneth Tobey was also in The Thing from Another world (1951) and more famously Airplane! (1980). Faith Domergue is good as the female lead, she definitely has the appeal of 1950's actress. Donald Curtis is also another actor who would later play in The Ten Commandments (1956). Its also fairly clear that his film didn't a have a good budget for its time, but for what is put on screen, it's not that bad. I'll admit there are few scenes where it's like someone is standing in front of a green screen but again, that might've been all they had for that scene and it wasn't that often either.Mischa Bakaleinikoff the composer to film's score wasn't bad either. It had all the right tunes for various scenes but it was also not the strongest. It definitely did its job that's for sure. But if there is one thing to really admire with this movie is Ray Harryhausen's master techniques in creature / visual effects. Apparently, the budget was so small, Harryhausen had to cut the octopus' legs down to six, not eight. Quite honestly, he hid that so well, I didn't even notice the difference. The miniature models were also well done too. Anything that has Harryhausen listed in the credits has great quality and that should be one of the main reasons to see this mid 1950's sci-fi monster movie.It may be lacking in a convincing story and character development, but the actors perform well anyway. The main attraction though, is Ray Harryhausen's clay animation of the enormous octopus.

There is basically no human chemistry between the human characters and it probably would have made the film a lot better. Also, Faith Domergue's character of Professor Joyce was hard to figure out. At first it seems as if her character wants to be taken seriously, but as the film goes on she seems to act as the typical pretty face that screams whenever danger approaches. However, the real star of the film is the monster, who was probably one of Harryhausen's finest creations.Also, one of the more interesting things about this film was the fact that they mentioned that the monster first appeared off the coast of Japan. Of course, this film was released about a year after another monster appeared off the coast of Japan, Gojira (aka. Godzilla). Despite all of its flaws, this was still a good effort by the master.

Among the people figuring out how to track down the beast and destroy it are intrepid submarine commander Pete Matthews (Kenneth Tobey) and scientists Lesley Joyce (Faith Domergue) and John Carter (Donald Curtis).The movie is typical of its kind in the way that an ever present narrator provides us with a generous amount of exposition. It is admittedly somewhat slow and dialogue heavy much of the time, and truthfully doesn't feature a whole lot of good octopus action, but in a way this does help in the appreciation of all of those moments when the monster makes its presence known.This was the first collaboration between producer Charles H. Schneer and legendary stop motion expert Ray Harryhausen, and Harryhausen's effects are as always quite fun to watch. Even if budget constraints necessitated the octopus possess six tentacles rather than eight, the effects still work incredibly well. Robert Gordon's direction is efficient right down the line, up to the big finish which is equal parts exciting and suspenseful. Of course, with an engaging Tobey in the lead, this is highly watchable on that merit alone, as he'd proved himself a reliable hero in this and the other 50's science fiction efforts The Thing from Another World and The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. The beautiful Domergue is good, with her character in the mold of other leading ladies from the era intelligent and capable, and more than eye candy. Curtis is solid in a no-nonsense role and the three main characters also figure in a love triangle that takes up a little too much of the running time. A fine supporting cast also includes Ian Keith, Dean Maddox Jr., Chuck Griffiths, Harry Lauter, Richard W. Peterson, and Del Courtney. Anybody who enjoys the genre, Harryhausen's work, or the actors is sure to have a good time with It Came from Beneath the Sea.Seven out of 10.

Director Robert Gordon, working from a compact script by George Worthing Yates, relates the engrossing story at a steady pace, maintains a serious tone throughout, and stages the monster attack scenes with aplomb (the sequence with the big creature destroying the Golden Gate Bridge rates as the definite exciting highlight). The solid acting from the competent cast helps a lot Tobey does well in one of his customary stalwart hero roles, the lovely Faith Domergue holds her own as the feisty Professor Lesley Joyce, and Donald Curtis contributes a sturdy turn as the esteemed Dr. John Carter. Ray Harryhausen's typically fine and fluid stop-motion animation does an ace job of bringing the slimy behemoth to life. Moreover, there's a surprisingly radical and progressive subtext concerning Professor Joyce, there's an earnest quality to this picture that's impossible to dislike, and the inevitable romance between Matthews and Joyce provides a good deal of sweet charm thanks to the strong chemistry between Tobey and Domergue.

I'm not saying the Director Robert Gordon and others did a horrible job. I'm just saying besides the visuals in the film, there is nothing worth saying about the film. It was just another Sci-fi B-movie with a simple plot. It had a lot to say about what the nuclear tests and waste products of the day could do to living things. Like other Sci-Fi films at the time, without really looking into the science books, or watching old films that show that being expose to radiation or radioactive material would cause sickness or death. The movie has a make-believe field day by saying that Atom-Bomb cause things to get larger. Throughout the 1950's, you had a number of these types of clichés film. Example of objects in movies getting larger by being expose by radiation are ants, reptiles, and now octopuses! This film had an atomic size octopus from the deepest realms of the Pacific threatens the world's oceans wrecking and shipping anything that touches the water. Navy Captain Pete Mathews (Kenneth Tobey) and two expert marine-biologists, John Carter (Donald Curtis) and Lesley Joyce (Faith Domergue), work around the clock to find a way to stop the creature. The highlight of the film in my opinion, is where the creature create havoc on San Francisco Bay looking for some food supplies. The octopus's food supply have their own internal Geiger Counter to dying off the radiation was never explained, and doesn't make any real scientific sense. Anyways it's driven off, and found the Bay Area to being yummy! It wraps its tentacles around Golden Gate Bridge is amazing stop-moment action even if it's missing two. Ray trying to save money gave the Octopus only six tentacles than eight. I love the scene where the creature attacked the Ferry Building. It's kinda funny that cars are still passing by the Embarcadero while the creature was attacking. I think the movie makers forgot to cut the cars from that shot. There is a shot of the Octopus attacking the submarine that was pretty worthy that might pay tribute to Jules Verne or trying to rip his idea of a Giant Octopus attacking the submarine off. While I think it's pretty good, I have to say the Octopus that was attacking the Nautilus in Disney's 20000 Leagues under the Sea (1954) was better visual than this. Plus, this film didn't have Captain Nemo that would make the film, even better. Although this movie plot is little more than a rehash of earlier Atomic Age horrors movies like The Beast from 20,000 (1953), another Ray Harryhausen movie. The romantic sub plot is annoying to the point, it ruins the movie. There was a scene where they were testing the nuclear radiation. Three scientists are wearing protective suits while examining the specimen. Dr. Joyce stupidly removes her radiation suit, and Pete Matthews falls in love with her, rather than caring about her just being expose to radiation just then. Dr. Lesley is the worst scientist in the world. Rather than doing her job that could have save hundreds of Americans lives, she falls in love with a sea captain and spent more time with wooing him than solving this case. This story is presented as a documentary, as there is a narrator narrating pointless dilogue that isn't needed. Show, don't tell, movie. There are two versions of this film. One in color in newer DVDs while the older has it in black and white. In my opinion, I think it is best to leave the B&W movies in their original form. Overall the film pace is slow, is filled with stereotypes, and despairingly old fashioned. Still it's a lot of cheesy fun. Columbia booked this as a double bill with Creature with the Atom Brain all across the US. I wish it came with it. I would had love that. This is the film that brought together producer Charles H. Schneer and special effects legend Ray Harryhausen. Their professional relationship would last until Clash of the Titans, the final feature for both men.

Of all the science-fiction spectacles to feature rampaging behemoths&#x97;and I've seen quite a few in my time&#x97;many of the best were the ones produced on limited budgets. The theories are many, but I personally believe it is because a lesser supply of funds forces the filmmakers to rely on their ingenuity and their art-driven passion. They make the movie they would want to see on the big screen. I have no doubt that Charles H. Schneer, the producer of It Came from Beneath the Sea, was very interested in seeing a movie where a giant octopus tore the Golden Gate Bridge to ribbons. However, his screenwriters and director seemed far less fascinated by the premise than he. As a result, the picture, despite some high moments, is nothing more than a passionless and unremarkable bore.One of the core problems with It Came from Beneath the Sea is a complete lack of dread. Even though the movie's plot revolves around a monstrous octopus using its tentacles to sink ships and tear apart harbors, the storytelling seems to regard this as a remarkably mundane event. The characters seem to have no real interest in contending with this monstrosity. This again returns to the faults of the screenplay it also devotes much more time to the back-stories of the humans than necessary. How so? Because not one plot element&#x97;least of all the obligatory romance&#x97;has any spark of passion in it. The actors do what they can, but they never come across with enough energy to really serve a purpose for being on the screen for so long. And when it's all over&#x97;the climax, that is&#x97;there is no sense of a resolution. No reaction from the actors that would seem suitable considering their close encounter with a creature that had torn San Francisco's famous suspension bridge into pieces just earlier in the film. It's as if the events had faded from their memory.That's very much how It Came from Beneath the Sea fares as a monster picture. It drags, making its whole 79 minutes seem much longer than it is, and then evaporates in the mind just hours later. And the octopus, though well-animated by stop motion maestro Ray Harryhausen, is a rather uninteresting menace. We see very little of the creature and its sparse attacks on civilization are static. Even the film's most famous sequence, with the giant cephalopod wrapping its powerful arms around the Golden Gate Bridge, is inter-cut with too many elsewhere-in the-city moments, dragging out any sense of excitement from the sequence. And the big underwater payoff, which consists mostly of the beast just sitting on the ocean floor, is even more of a letdown. The most interesting moments consist of soldiers shooing the octopus's tentacles away with flame-throwers. There are plenty of really good vintage spectacles involving sea monsters; this is not one of them.

Everything is given a scientific explanation and unlike what you'd expect to see in a modern film of a similar topic, there's nobody championing peace or trying to understand this creature.

Some standard elements include Alpha males woo an attractive female scientist, lots of military toys go into action, authority figures eventually recognize the danger but their actions cannot solve the problem, the threat is a consequence of nuclear testing, the situation can only be properly understood and resolved by a combination of expert scientist and action hero (the alpha male).It Came From Beneath the Sea features an atomic submarine as the centerpiece military toy. However, in the movie, we are shown old WWII diesel submarine types (stock substitutions are all just part of the fun of 50s movies). There is lots of other military hardware in action - search and rescue aircraft, helicopters, flamethrowers and so on. And we get a glimpse of 50s Pax Americana, as the US just arbitrarily shuts down all north Pacific shipping, thereby halting trade on three continents, and does not disclose their reasons to any other nation. Nice! Although It Came From Beneath The Sea is a good movie, it could be better. The problem is that there is little drama or tension (aside from the opening scene in the submarine, which is excellent) until almost an hour into the picture. Finally, when the monster attacks San Francisco the pace picks up and the action gets goofy in that 50s monster movie style we all know and love. Of course the two alpha males each have to personally fight the monster one at a time! It is all good stuff and the stop motion effects of the rampaging octopus tearing apart the San Fransico waterfront makes the movie worthwhile.As in many movies there is a love triangle, but it is not well handled here. The serious scientist character of Dr. John Carter (Donald Curtis) has little dramatic impact because he does not deliver any romantic competition. If there is any conflict in the love triangle, it is a contrast between the detached intellectual (who does not get the girl) and the wolfish man of action (who does). But I felt cheated because there were no fireworks or conflict between the two men. The main alpha male, Cmdr. Pete Mathews (Kenneth Tobey), is terrific as a tough, wolfish submarine commander (yet for some reason he also supervises the scientists and their onshore research). The love interest, Dr. Lesley Joyce (Faith Domergue), is one of the ...new breed of woman that feels they are just as smart and courageous as men. Her character alternates between domineering scientist and sultry seductress, which is confusing (but fun). The problem with the love triangle is that it takes a long time to never develop. All three characters get along just fine and are good friends from start to finish.For me, a truly enjoyable 50s monster movie must have lots of head shaking, bizarre moments. What about It Came From Beneath the Sea? -The pick up scene at the lab. Talk about predatory! Pete physically backs Lesley into a corner just after they first meet, (smoking a cigarette with a 'No Smoking' sign in the background) and gets deep into her personal space. Far from being uncomfortable, Lesley responds to his predation with sultry innuendo while she suggestively caresses a test tube.-Lesley extracts information from a survivor of a ship sunk by the octopus. The survivor is afraid to talk about his experience to the doctors because he is afraid of being declared insane (typical 50s fear of non-normal). In a nearby meeting room, Lesley announces to the several men in the room that she will try to talk to the survivor. She stands up, strips off her sweater and tosses it aside, saunters out of the room, then gets alone with the survivor and seduces the man with practiced skill. Mesermerized by her come on, he tells his tale. Are all female scientists this sexy? -The beach swim scene makes no plot sense at all. Of course, the purpose of the scene was to get both Pete and Lesley in swimsuits, but there should have been better attention to eye candy. The shot was too brief and too far away. Their embrace is steamy and suggestive, however.-13 days and nights of research for two premier marine biology experts to find out that a barrel sized piece of creature they examine is from a species of giant octopus. Really? I would have guessed they could make that determination in 13 minutes. I also love how dumping a couple of goldfish in a small tank with a radiated octopus somehow proves that fish have natural Geiger counters and can therefore avoid being eaten by a radioactive creatures...Huh? The goof ball science in these movies is just a joy to watch.-I really enjoy the beach scene at the jeep where the two alpha males and Lesley discuss the new breed of woman. Right after declaring that she is a help in a crisis, the monster attacks the sheriff. She screams helplessly! But what do our alpha males do? Try to rescue the sheriff?

The opening sequence where the first atomic submarine is stalked and pursued by a mysterious monster came off especially well (apparently they used a real sub for the interior sets in the sequence) and the first actual appearance of the octopus/kraken as it wraps its tentacles around a freighter and pulls it underneath the waves is very visceral and impressive.And I enjoyed seeing Faith Domergue again so soon after viewing This Island Earth a couple weeks back...and Kenneth Tobey was a good looking leading man with some real charisma.But still...many of the exposition scenes are talky, clunky, and static. And the small parts are filled with obvious non-actors who just can't make their lines work well (when a real character actor like Harry Lauter shows up for a few moments, the difference is painfully obvious). Plus,the romantic triangle between the two scientists and the Navy captain is ridiculous. It sputters along and doesn't really go anywhere, and doesn't add much to the script. I've read that Tobey's big love scene with Domergue, which would have resolved or paid off the time spent developing the romantic triangle, was summarilyy tossed out by the producer, who decided that the movie was finished even if the director did not.Still, I liked it and am glad I got to see it. If you need a monster movie fix, this one will get the job done.

Domergue is much too frozen-faced to show any warmth for her leading man and her expressionless demeanor is no help at all. But the story becomes involving the moment the creature appears, able to toss around huge structures, such as a lighthouse, with a mere reach of his many arms.It's the sort of fantasy that kids and adults enjoyed in the '50s when stop-motion was being used in several successful horror films. This is one of the better films of its genre, but don't expect to be overwhelmed by techniques which now seem a little primitive.

The stop-motion effects were advanced at the time, and they're not bad, but they're not as convincing as in some similar flicks. The octopus hasn't got enough limbs, which saves money, I suppose. The sea beast should properly be called a hexapus or something.The acting is varied, from good (Kenneth Toby) through medium (Faith Domergue) to plumb awful. Poor Donald Curtis is the second male lead and is totally out of his depth, so to speak, as he was in Earth vs. The Flying Saucers. I have never seen another actor who was less able to convince us that he was anything other than an actor -- even standing still he's unnatural, with his pursed lips and wandering, vacant stare. Kenneth Toby, on the other hand is pretty good. He's shorter than I am, so he earns bonus points right there. His ears are like unto those of an African elephant and when he's given the right script and direction, as in Howard Hawks' The Thing From Another World, he does just fine. Faith Domergue -- well, she must have been under contract.While we're on acting, a viewer can do a reasonably good job of telling which of the Navy radiomen actually had experience on the job and which did not. If the guy is wearing his earphones directly over his external auditory canal, he's nothing more than an extra hired for the job. If he's wearing his earphones centered ahead of his ears, over the little flap of skin at the ear's forward edge, he knows what's up. The radioman wearing glasses in the control room has probably been on the job. The radioman stationed at the Golden Gate bridge, the one who is ordered to pull the switch, is an actor.In one of Ray Bradbury's stories, later made into a film, The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, a dinosaur hears a lighthouse bellowing in the fog and misinterprets it as a mating call, leading to a destroyed lighthouse and a sexually frustrated reptile who winds up atop the roller coaster at Coney Island. Now that's what I mean by originality. It's lacking here. It Came From Beneath the Sea looks like a compendium of already stereotyped incidents and characters from better movies of the time -- the stern male authority figure, the woman who is a scientist and insists on going along, the other man, the failed attempts to foil or destroy the monster as it approaches civilization, ending with an extravaganza of blubber.Yet, if this isn't a sterling example of the genre, it's not at all offensive. It's many fathoms above something that might bear a title like, Atomic Monsters From Flying Saucers Eat Brains!, starring Lance Sterling, LaLa Divoon, James J. Whitebread, and Cecil Calabash as The Professor. Story by Ray Boysenberry. Special effects by Wray Hairyhouse. It Came From Beneath the Sea may be routine but it's not insulting to adult sensibilities.

Schneer/Ray Harryhausen collaboration on various fantasy films which lasted till the early 1980s. It’s a typical sci-fi effort of the period a usually harmless creature, rendered huge and deadly via radiation, is unleashed upon a large American city (though, being an octopus, its fury is restricted to the bay area) – and the U.S. Navy teams up with a couple of renowned biologists to battle the monster.Fast-moving, fairly gripping and featuring solid characterizations – even going so far as to include a mildly risqué ménage-a'-trois situation involving the protagonists! – the film generally delivers the goods as the unassuming but professionally-made entertainment it was meant to be. It stars Kenneth Tobey from THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD (1951) as the Atomic Submarine Commander who first realizes that something’s wrong ‘down below’, and Faith Domergue from THIS ISLAND EARTH (1955) as the female member of the biological team. Basically, they’re duplicating their roles from the earlier films I mentioned – except that Domergue emerges here to be sexy as well as brainy (rather than staid as she was in THIS ISLAND EARTH), especially in a scene where she cajoles a frightened seaman into recounting his near-fatal brush with the giant squid.Considering that the creature’s appearance is usually relegated to the flash of one of its tentacles (occasionally done in close-up for maximum impact), Harryhausen’s effects aren’t quite as spectacular (or extensive) as in his later colorful mythological adventures. That said, the monster’s seen pulling a ship down to the bottom, causes considerable mayhem at the Golden Gate bridge, and is even given one scary effect when its eye suddenly opens underwater just as Tobey and his ‘rival’ (Domergue’s colleague/lover) dive for a closer inspection.I had been toying with the idea of picking up Columbia’s “Ray Harryhausen Collection” DVDs for ages – somehow, I managed to get hold of all of them except for MYSTERIOUS ISLAND (1961; which should be rectified soon as I happened upon it at a DVD rental store!). This viewing of IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA (1955) – which came by way of a DivX copy, thus bearing the format’s usual trait of wobbly video quality (but, in this case, also muffled audio!) – will be followed by TWENTY MILLION MILES TO EARTH (1957; just recently announced for a 2-Disc “Special Edition” re-issue!) and FIRST MEN IN THE MOON (1964)...

Even though this movie doesn't have an alien-like monster to boast, it has plenty of great dialog and serious acting. The three lead characters (2 scientists and 1 military commander) are great in this respect. I like it when the characters act responsibly and make intelligent decisions. It's exciting to see what happens when the humans involved are actually smart. A good movie, like a good magician, will still have plenty of surprises for you.One other nice point about this movie are the variety of locations the movie draws on. At different times we're inside a sub, at a beach, at various points in the SF Bay Area, underwater, in a lab, etc. Also, there are some nice broad city and military shots interspersed throughout the movie.On the minus side, the monster, a large octopus, was not very interesting at all (it probably was to 50's audiences). Another big problem for me was that the male scientist, speaking in support of the female scientist, stated seriously stated women are now becoming equal to men and don't have to be scurried away from danger like children (it was so well done, one would think the filmmakers were making a positive political comment). Well, at every subsequent possible opportunity she is seen screaming, crying, turning away and leaning onto men. Kind of sad to see.Also, there are a few plot holes, but I'll allow a few embarrassing ones to slip by given the quality of this movie. Catch this one if you enjoy 50's sci-fi movies.

It's the kind of flick you can watch so many times you know the lines better than the actors do, and still have fun watching it.This one has an octopus that looks great in forced-perspective shots, and the black and white filming technique makes the sea beast look all the more eerie and threatening. The movie wisely avoids showing the monster, except as a mysterious blob on radar, (for the effective unseen menace approach) until about half way through the film. Some of the elements of the classic Them are seen, as a team of scientists and military personnel join forces to track the thing down and hopefully kill it before it kills all of us.The three principal heroes in saving the world are two scientists (Donald Curtis and Faith Domergue) and a submarine captain (Kenneth Tobey). Domergue is terrific as always (she could sit there reading a book and look good), and she and Tobey make for some good chemistry when they don't have their hands full with the octopus.I love the primitive yet well-executed stop-action photography fx.

The alluring, lovely-eyed Domergue plays one of the first 1950s feminist scientists, not about to take a back seat, standing up to naval commander Kenneth Tobey (The Thing - 1951). In an early sequence in the lab, she's handling a giant test-tube (phallic symbol?) as they discuss monster-hunting but it's also not beneath her to use feminine charms to vamp information from a sailor, a great scene, or scream horrifically, and look glamorous in white summer dresses and large jewels.

The scene of the giant octopus reaching its huge tentacles into the streets of San Francisco are stunning.  Harryhausen made each questing tentacle seem like an individual monster.  One of the tentacles smashes a second story window, pokes its tip through the opening, and waves back and forth as if it's `looking around' the room.A squad of soldiers arrive with flame throwers to drive back a huge, snaky invader -- and the octopus actually howls when it's burned!  A very clever bit of personification.

There is no excitement, no tension, mainly because the main characters have little interaction with the beast for most of the movie. Who is in danger? Where is the fear? The destruction by the sea beast and the hunt to stop it plays like a newsreel, not a story you get caught up in.The plot of this lame monster movie is driven by two pathetic techniques - the authoritative voice over, and the old meeting of the minds trick. The voice over may work in a crime drama but it fails for a sci-fi flick; it distances you from the action, hindering your envelopment within the make believe world of the film. The meeting of the minds is a classic tool of the lousy director; gather a bunch of people together and have a plodding discussion about what's happening so the viewer can be informed. Boring! And don't get me started on the wooden acting and awkward exchanges. Or were all the secondary characters actual members of the military? That would explain the bad acting. Faith Domergue is fine as the female lead but Kenneth Tobey as the macho sub commander on the make? Please, what would Faith see in that dud?

I think this particular title was a terrific choice because, out of all the films he worked on, the gigantic octopus definitely ranks amongst Harryhausen's finest accomplishments; even if it had only 6 arms instead of 8. It's largely thanks to our man Ray's work and a handful of legendary sequences (the squid climbing the Golden Gate Bridge, for example) that this film is still remembered as part of the cinematic monster-mayhem of the 1950's, because the script is rather weak and the pacing is continuously interrupted by one of the most annoying triangular relationship sub plots in the history of cinema. The entire American marine force is alarmed when Commander Pete's submarine bumped into a giant living creature whilst bobbing in the Pacific Ocean. Extended research by eminent biologists proves that the animal tissue that got jammed in the propellers belongs to an octopus, only this jolly critter is extremely over-sized and on the prowl. For once oceanic pollution or nuclear radiation isn't responsible for the animal's proportions (the script just automatically assumes these things exist), however, military bombing tests did cause for the animal to get disturbed and leave its natural biotope. Instead of feeding on small fish, he now enjoys pulling down entire ships (including the crews) and plans an ultimate sightseeing trip in San Francisco. Stop motion effects may look incredibly dated and even quite silly by nowadays standards, but still nothing feels as charming and nostalgic as Harryhausen's fantastic work. And impressive! Imagine what complex and hard labor it must have been to achieve the aforementioned Golden Gate bridge scene or the footage where the squid pulverizes pedestrians with its tentacle using only frame-by-frame shots of clay figures & designs! These days it's all too easy (and equally fake-looking) through CGI techniques, but stop-motion was the real thing! As said, It Came From Beneath The Sea sadly suffers from a dull and uninteresting sub plots, like Kenneth Tobey's character falling in love with the female scientist (Faith Domergue) but at the same time he refuses to accept the evolution of feminism. Extremely lame but whenever those tentacles emerge from the water, guided by eerie music and tight photography, you (re)-realize why this is still a bona fide 50's monster movie classic.

We never see the thing as it tries to get up close and personal with the first nuclear-powered submarine. We just see the officers and men trying to stay alive.

The octopus--and most everything else--shows what happens when a good story is sacrificed at the altar of SFX. Harryhausen was so clearly not up to the task here--8 years away from the wonderfully scary Jason and the Argonauts and 26 years before Clash of the Titans.

Ray Harryhausen, who learned from the legendary Willis O'Brien (King Kong), saves this film and is the only real reason to watch. The rest of the film is a paint-by-numbers plot that could be switched out with many other '50's giant monster flicks.The plot deals with a giant octopus that becomes irradiated by hydrogen bomb tests. The radiation warns away its natural prey, so it comes to the surface for food. It attacks a submarine commanded by Kenneth Tobey (Thing from Another World, The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, The Howling, Airplane), where it loses a tip of its tentacle. Later, it attacks a ship, kills some swimmers and becomes a menace to all when it stops off in San Francisco where it most assuredly decides not to wear flowers in its hair. Science joins with military might to come up with a solution.Harryhausen's stop-motion magic makes the beast come alive, especially when it pulls down a tanker at sea, wraps itself around the Golden Gate Bridge and later smashes it way through the Ferry Building and the Embarcadero on Frisco's waterfront.Unfortunately, when the beast isn't around, the story slows to a dull pace. Tobey is aided by two scientists, both of whom join him in a not-very-believable love triangle, but such fare was standard for Hollywood. Dr. John Carter is played by Donald Curtis (Earth Vs. The Flying Saucer, The Amazing Mr. X), while Leslye Joyce is played by the ever-luscious Faith Domergue (This Island Earth, Cult of the Cobra, Voyage to a Prehistoric Planet). The two expert scientists somehow take two weeks to learn that the tip of the tentacle comes from an octopus.The love triangle makes for some odd situations, such as when Tobey and Domergue find evidence that the beast has attacked and killed a family off the coast of Oregon. While waiting for help to arrive, they change into swimsuits and go fishing! Obviously, the plot twist was to make the romance blossom, but it actually makes them look stupid since they know the beast is in the area. But, hey, it got Faith Domergue into a swimsuit and that's what counted. It was the 50's and Domergue was the perfect sweater girl.Of the three principals, Domergue comes off as the most disappointing. She touts herself as being equal to men and even Donald Curtis' character says she's a new breed of women. But, just like in This Island Earth, when the action gets hot, she's shunted off to the side like a helpless female. She says she doesn't want to be ordered around, then lets Tobey's character order her food for her. She wants to be treated like everyone else, then resorts to sexual come-ons to get information out of a tanker survivor. She says she's dying for a chance to see the beast, then screams and flees to Tobey's shoulder when the beast appears. Unfortunately, it would be almost 30 years before Ellen Ripley and Sarah Conner showed up.That said, most of the film's problems stemmed from its low budget. Just like in Them, the low budget meant the lead characters had to be supermen, running all over the west coast to investigate things, as if there was no one else available.The film was produced by Charles H. Scheer, who worked with Harryhausen on films like Jason & The Argonauts, Clash of the Titans, 20 Million Miles to Earth and three Sinbad pictures. The film was written by Hal Smith and George Worthing Yates. Strangely, Smith quit with such dark fare after this film and become a well-known voice-over artist for Disney and Hanna-Barbera. Yates continued with his dark work in such films as Earth Vs. The Spider, The Amazing Colossal Man, War of the Colossal Beast and King Kong vs. Godzilla, among others.Sadly, director Robert Gordon, who had been a B-movie actor in the 30's, never achieved too much after this movie. He became a TV director (The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, Mr Friend Flicka, Maverick) before flaming out on screen with The Gatling Gun in 1973.Some odd things to look for 1) The beast rises out of the ocean to attack a tanker and the crew immediately abandon ship into the water with the beast.2) The overlays. Harryhausen couldn't build a miniature of the Embarcadero and had to meld his beast over stock footage, resulting in drivers calmly passing underneath the menacing tentacles as if they were an everyday sight.3) Like in other monster flicks of the 50's, democracy doesn't come out smelling like a rose. As usual, the government purposely sits on info about deadly menaces. This film shows the Navy keeping a lid on the monster story, even closing off the shipping lanes of the Pacific Ocean to all nations under threat of U.S. naval might, like Big Brother gone wild.All in all, an enjoyable flick once it gets to the beast. When the beast isn't around, the film is literally a fish out of water (sorry for the pun).

What did stay in my memory were those huge Harryhausen tentacles coming out of the water and, later, bearing down on the streets of Frisco. These were striking images from that era and probably more famous than most from the fifties. It's another sample of atomic age giant monster peril of the fifties, the best of which was Them from the previous year. It's never clear that our atomic weapons actually caused this beast, besides just disturbing it from its deep water existence, though they keep referring to it as radioactive (stay away from it - it's radioactive! forget that it can crush an elephant with one tentacle). Like the much later Deep Rising from the late nineties, the implication is that the deeper in the ocean you go, the bigger things are down there; you just gotta hope they never come up. Oh, well.The movie begins almost like a documentary on our latest submarines in the first minute but soon everything shifts, due to a low budget, to dramatizing things via suggestion crewmen pretend to be jolted inside the fake interior of the sub, much like the crew on the Star Trek sixties show pretending that their ship has tilted. Even Ray Harryhausen, who became a firm fixture in fantastic cinema after this, was stymied by the budget, unable to show all 8 tentacles. There are slow spots in-between the beast's appearances and the almost-love-triangle of the 3 main characters is typical ham-handed stoic Americana of the '50s - rather hackneyed considering they should all concentrate more on the problem at hand. I admit I have a soft spot for this since the final 3rd takes place in my old hometown of San Francisco - itself a rare treat for monster fans. The scenes of the Golden Gate Bridge being attacked and then the city itself during the spectacular climax are worth the price of admission. You have to admit - this thing is HUGE.

Submarine commander Pete Mathews(Kenneth Tobey)joins top notch scientists John Carter(Donald Curtis) and Lesley Joyce(Faith Domergue)in the discovery that the strange material is a piece of a giant octopus spawned by radiation.

The Navy sub once again confronts the sea monster and fires a torpedo in hopes of killing the octopus...but the sub is now in the clutches of the powerful tentacles. Commander Mathews dives into the sea to try and free his submarine before the bomb explodes, but is knocked unconscious by the sea monster. Then comes the unlikely heroic efforts of Dr. Carter to the rescue.

Harryhausen does a masterful job with the creature. It's almost like each tentacle has a life of it's own through his painstaking work. The attack on San Francisco was fantastic. The Octopus ripping down the Golden Gate Bridge, snaking his tentacles into the streets squashing hapless civilians, crushing a train car, tearing apart the Ferry Building. And earlier in the picture, when the Octopus pulls a freighter down to the bottom of the sea. Fun stuff! Plus the cool gurgling sound the octopus makes, really adds to the creatures persona. My favourite scene was when the Octopus was sitting at the bottom of San Francisco Bay and snags the atomic Navy Sub with one of it's tentacles in the films climax.The only thing that ruins this film, as I mentioned above, is the wooden acting (But who cares. You watch these movies for the monster sequences) and the slowness of the middle frame. It would have been nice if you could see the Octopus more throughout the film.Out of all the big screen cephalopods through the years, this one was the most spectacular and realistic.

The film was the 78 minute long black and white classic from 1955, called It Came From Beneath The Sea. While not one of the more hyped Harryhausen classics, it still is a good sci fi film, and a cut above the usual drive-in fare of that era. Plus, drum roll, it's a film whose female star is Faith Domergue- goddess of Cold War sci fi flicks (This Island Earth, Voyage To The Prehistoric Planet).The tale is rather pedestrian- H Bomb tests have irradiated a giant octopus, thus making its natural prey avoid him, for most fish (we are told in the film) can detect radiation. The film's shots of the huge tentacles emerging from the deep are impressive, although the rear projection shots, including some Hawaiian scenes, often are poorly visually matched to the studio sets, as are some of the water scenes filmed with models. The scalability of water has yet to be resolved in films. But, overall, Columbia did a quality transfer to the disk, for the print is relatively clean. Henry Freulich was the cinematographer, and did a serviceable job- especially in integrating some stock military footage from the Korean War, as did Mischa Bakeleinikoff with the musical score. The film was shot in a 1.851 aspect ratio, and was directed by Robert Gordon, but Harryhausen's monster is the main attraction, even if, technically, it was a sextopus (with only six tentacles, not eight), because two less legs meant less expenses. The DVD had the extra features almost all the films in the set do, the brief This Is Dynamation documentary, and the hour long profile of Harryhausen, called The Harryhausen Chronicles, narrated by Leonard Nimoy, and featuring Ray Bradbury, Harryhausen's old pal. There are also a few theatrical trailers for other releases 20 Million Miles To Earth, Mysterious Island, and Close Encounters Of The Third Kind.One other aspect of the film that is worth noting is the narration, which, often in such films, borders on the inane, with stentorian hyperbole. This film's narration is more straightforward, like a reporter might give, although, at times, it does veer into that crescendo of 'SCIENCE!', as if that pursuit were almighty. Dig this bit from the opening (whoa, a little Beatnik slip) For centuries the mind of Man has learned comparative little of the mysteries of the heavens above- or the seas below. Since the coming of the atomic age, Man's knowledge has so increased that an upheaval of nature would not be beyond his belief.On the downside there is the superfluous and forced love triangle aspect; especially glaring when Pete and Lesley go 'fishing' while waiting for the arrival of the Navy on an Oregon beach, and frolic romantically in swimsuits. Never are they harmed, but, of course, a disbelieving local sheriff's deputy ends up killed by the octopus. That said, however, overall, It Came From Beneath The Sea is an enjoyable romp into the past, and at well less than an hour and a half, a good, light film to watch before tucking oneself in at night, as long as one has not just come home from an excursion to Red Lobster. Sorry, I could not resist. "},{"Title":"Cheeky, satirical, compelling, and of course, raucously enjoyable - a guilty pleasure with only a mite of guilt required","Date":"27 July 2009","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" With such a memorably melodramatic title, it would be verging on impossible to mistake It Came From Beneath the Sea for anything but what it is - a proud entry into the campily enjoyable subgenre of horror films which is the 1950s monster picture. Indeed, it appears from the start that the film was consciously constructed for exactly such means, assembling an impeccable checklist of components which had made past such films successful legendary visual effects expert Ray Harryhausen, grizzled genre star Kenneth Tobey, a story template constructed primarily around the appearances of its monstrous fiend... even a title which appears a sneaky pilfering from earlier hit It Came From Outer Space. But, rather than being a shoddy bricolage of past heights, when viewed in a contemporary context the film proves a surprising success, not just in comparison to the other monster films of its ilk, but as a commendably sturdy, well thought out and memorably entertaining piece of cinema.What proves the most persistently remarkable is the cheeky sense of humour and satire director Robert Gordon brings into play, even in the least likely moments. From his sly use of a banal narrator, spouting off a lot but actually saying very little, to several more ironically overt instances of poking fun at horror staples (one character ironically addresses the cause for the creature's creation by saying H-Bombs are blamed for everything these days!), Gordon's film quickly establishes itself as a thinly veiled satire of the monster film as much as it simultaneously moves ahead in becoming an exhilarating and entertaining one in its own right. But apart from such self-aware undertones, the film also comes across as unexpectedly thematically rich and poignant in the midst of its trashy trappings, with a pointedly biting commentary on military procedure (the army's initial plan to deal with the monster is randomly, aimlessly bombing the ocean in the hopes of hitting it at some point) and, in more daring instances, particularly overt snipes at the pending cold war, as the army is also seen keeping secrets from the UN strictly for their own benefit, regardless of the inherent moral qualms. Gordon appears to even take a crack at addressing the emerging onset of feminism, drawing continual attention to Faith Domergue's strong female character, and placing emphasis on lines such as there's a new breed of woman who don't like being pushed around - which is given a particularly caustic and witty spin as the giant octopus attacks immediately afterward, as if signifying cultural attempts to quell such sentiments. But, despite the social commentary which can be dragged up, Gordon's film clearly has for the most part a rather single-handed purpose - to entertain, as only the most deranged and gleefully macabre monster movies can. On this front the film also manages to exceed expectations, as Harryhausen's iconic effects prove remarkably credible for their time, crafting a remarkably fluid and tangible giant octopus complete with a memorable gurgling sound, even if the slow moving behemoth may not seem quite as threatening as it should, given its glorious array of destruction. And glorious it is, as Gordon doggedly pushes the envelope of creature mayhem, confronting the monster with flamethrowers, helicopters, submarines and more, as well as the now famous climax as the monster storms the Golden Gate bridge. But even beyond the special effects Gordon manages to churn his film into an exhilarating spectacle, with a particularly credible depiction of a city crumbling into chaos while coping with a crisis, making the human drama nearly as gripping as the rampaging monster causing it. As such, it is a bit disappointing to see most encounters with the octopus ending in odd anti-climaxes, often with the military abruptly running away with no real explanation - despite the dash of comparative realism that people would run away at the sight of a massive octopus, such sequences detract from the film's otherwise steady pacing, feeling excessively jarring and rupturing the otherwise engrossing sense of sheer fun. It certainly helps the film's quality to have the always reliable Kenneth Tobey fuming sturdily as yet another gruff but endearing military captain, even if his character is often trapped in corny romantic sequences which feel too slyly satirical to be as clichéd as they initially seem. Helping such an effect is the impressive performance of Faith Domergue as Tobey's eventual love interest, surprisingly credible as a brilliant female scientist, and thankfully given a far more dignified, self-reliant and even decently developed female role in a genre infamous for reducing women to eye candy and screams. Donald Curtis is also endearingly curt and businesslike as Domergue's prickly scientist fiancé, making for a surprisingly appealing if inevitably underdeveloped three way bout of romantic tension, which suitably balances the mayhem unfolding around it. Despite the film's determination to be as raucously enjoyable and gratuitously fun as possible, where It Came From Beneath the Sea really rises leagues above its campy peers is its sly, self-referential sense of humour, demonstrating an intellect, no matter how subtle, far beyond what its subject matter called for. While still very much a product of its time, context and scope, and thus peppered with obvious shortcomings, Gordon's film remains worth watching through its embracing its B-movie aims of telling a giant monster movie, yet doing so with class, quality and credibility without sacrificing the cheeky entertainment factor. In essence, a guilty pleasure with only a mite of guilt required, and one well worth investigating. -6.5/10 "},{"Title":"Worthless besides the Harryhausen effects","Date":"29 September 2008","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" A giant octopus attacks San Fransisco in this monster movie, a showcase for the special effects of Ray Harryhausen.

Pete Mathews, Kenneth Tobey, feels that whatever attacked his sub had to be some kind of sea monster.Capt. Mathews' suspicions were confirmed back at port in Pearl Harbor by world renowned marine biologist Professor John Carter, Donald Curtis, as well as his colleague and girlfriend Professor Lesley Joyce, Faith Demergoe. Lesley is not only a 29 year-old full-fledged tenured professor but the head of Marine Biology Department at the prestigious Southeastern Institute of Oceanography.It's here when the movie goes a bit off it's story with a meaningless and totally unconvincing love triangle between Captain Mathews and Prof. Carter over the both pretty and brainy Prof. Lesley Joyce who Mathews tries to get to eat, like he does, her T-bone stake on the rare with very little success . The excitement over It has two lovebirds even cancel a trip to Egypt that they had planned all year just to see what this IT, the thing that attack Mathews Atomic submarine, is really all about.It in the meantime is now slowly moving towards the US West Coast and It's existence is finally and visually confirmed, by Mathews Joyce & Carter, when It attacks local lawman Deputy Sheriff Bill Nash, Harry Lauter, at Oragon's Harpers Cove.

The stereotype of the cold, hard scientist whose intellect does not allow itself to be swayed by mere sentiment and feeling was especially prevalent in the old science fiction movies, and thus a beautiful female scientist constituted a special challenge for a macho man, used to having his way with ordinary women. In this movie, said macho man is Commander Pete Mathews.A lot of old movies are sexist by twenty-first century standards, but science fiction movies from the 1950s, with their inevitable beautiful female scientists, often have a feminist theme in them, pushing back against that sexism. But the message tends to be mixed, with the movie expressing a sexist attitude one minute and a feminist attitude the next. No more is this so than in It Came from Beneath the Sea.Joyce's colleague is Dr. John Carter. They have both been called in to investigate a hunk of mysterious substance that got caught in the diving plane of Mathews' submarine. When Joyce definitively determines the nature of the substance, a piece of giant octopus, Carter kisses her on the cheek, and then she nestles in his arms as Mathews calls Naval Intelligence. If they were actually involved romantically, this would not be so strange. But they are not. As a result, we get that strange mixture of feminism and sexism on the one hand, she is the expert in her field and has found the solution; on the other hand, she is a pretty girl that men just naturally kiss and hold in their arms, even when that man is a colleague in a professional setting.On their last night in Pearl Harbor, they all decide to have dinner together at a restaurant. After Mathews and Joyce dance for a while, we think that Mathews is going to try to kiss her, but she moves her head forward and kisses him instead and then puts her arms around him. So, contrary to appearances, she is a sexually aggressive woman. Then they return to the table and have their meal. When Mathews realizes that Joyce still intends to go to Cairo to study the Red Sea with Carter, he is shocked. Presumably, he thought that since they kissed, she was going to give up all this foolishness about a career, marry him, and have babies. He leaves in a huff.Their plans to go to Cairo, however, are foiled by the disappearance of a tramp steamer. In order to get the facts, a doctor examines the survivors. After the first survivor tells his story, the doctor decides he needs the care of a psychiatrist. The other three survivors, not wanting to be committed to a mental institution, deny having seen anything. They are given lie-detector tests, which show that they are lying about not seeing anything. And then the first survivor recants his story so that he can be released from the infirmary. Mathews and the other officers are exasperated and just don't understand why they can't get the truth out of these guys.Professor Joyce rises to the occasion. Removing her coat so as to expose a little more of her soft, warm flesh, she tells the officers she will talk to the first survivor when he is released, and then contrives to be alone with him in a room. Using her womanly wiles&#x97;giving him sexy looks, touching his hand, showing a little leg&#x97;she gets the man to admit he saw the sea monster, which the officers hear through the intercom. So, you see, that's why we need female scientists, because they have special ways of getting to the truth.Mathews and Joyce decide to investigate reports of poor fishing along the northwest coast, because it may be that the octopus has been eating all the fish. They spot what might be called an octopus footprint on the beach and they send for Carter. When Carter arrives with the deputy sheriff, Mathews asks Carter to help him persuade Joyce to leave and let the Navy take over the job. When Carter asks what Joyce has to say about that, Mathews responds, What's the difference what she says? At that point, Carter proceeds to lecture Mathews about women There's a whole new breed who feel they're just as smart and just as courageous as men. And they are. They don't like to be overprotected. They don't like to have their initiative taken away from them.Joyce picks up the argument A, you'd want me to miss the opportunity to see this specimen, one that may never come again. B, you'd be making up my mind for me. And C, I not only don't like being pushed around, but you underestimate my ability to help in a crisis. Carter says that he is entirely on her side, as she nestles into the arm her puts around her. Mathews concedes to having lost the argument.Suddenly, the octopus appears and kills the deputy, causing Joyce to scream like a girl.The octopus starts wreaking havoc on San Francisco, Mathews and Carter take turns saving each other's lives, during which Joyce screams again, finding solace first in Carter's arms and then Mathews', until at last the octopus is killed.They have dinner again. Mathews, saying that women can change, says he wants Joyce to marry him and start a family. She says she hasn't time for that and offers to collaborate with him on a book, How to Catch a Sea Beast. Mathews tells Carter he is right about this new breed of women.

And there are too many long, monotonous shots that feel as if the camera was left on and forgotten about. Then there is the whole big deal made about Domergue being a new woman only to have her scream like a kid the first time she sees the creature. This is an example of the film's biggest fault Ideas get tossed out, fall flat and are never seen again, with the film constantly making issues out of things unimportant to the plot.The love triangle thing is unfathomable, too. Who loves who? (Who cares!)The only way I can explain it as an adult is that the 3 stars, so nonchalant in their affections, must have been the most free wheeling folk of the 50s. Very bizarre stuff. As a kid I probably just labeled it adult nonsense and didn't even try to understand. And what's up with Kenneth Toby smoking in the lab with a giant No Smoking sign looming behind him? Just another example of the lack of attention to detail that mars this film from start to finish. In that vein, let's not forget the idiotic narration that gets inexplicably dropped halfway through the film.I love 50s SF. It's the mainstay of my collection. But it'll be a long time before I come around to this one again.Norman England "},{"Title":"Wind through to the giant squid scenes.","Date":"27 June 2004","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":"  The rest of this atomic-age B monster/disaster flick isn't bad enough to be funny, but not good enough to be interesting. The performances weren't nearly as bad as I thought they would be.A real B-movie classic, or camp classic has such poor acting its a laugh-a-minute, or its camp on purpose, like the early movies of Roger Corman (classic Little Shop of Horrors or Bucket of Blood).Still, there are enough perks here to make it worth a look classic shots of men in radioactive suits, scenes of those obvious double-entendres, a cliche love triangle, one of those classic scenes where a scientist comes in and demonstrates something with a mini-squid saying a regular squid does this, but this squid has been fed on radioactive meal, and so it does this! and best of all that classic tinny 50's voiceover that's to be heard to be believed.Certainly not an essential B-movie, except for the shots of Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion giant squid - its pure B-movie gold. The shot of the monster wrapping its tentacles (pictured on the box above - that shot will give you an idea what i mean when i say this is really cool - that kind of cool) was worth the rental alone. The last fifteen minutes is all sea beast - its great!6/10.

I recognized the area where the sea was filmed. It was filmed at the Salton Sea near Riverside County in southern California. The Salton Sea is nothing more than a barren wasteland where raw sewage from Mexico flows into the sea. The birds that fly over the sea have been known to just fall out of the sky dead..I kid you not! I have relatives that live down there, and they tell me that even the natives stay away from the Salton Sea because it is SO POLLUTED! The community that lives near the sea is made up mostly of squatters camps with homeless people, ex-cons and a lot of drug addicts. I heard that the Salton Sea was at one time a thriving vacation spot for movie stars back in the 1940's. Hard to believe that now! "}]
