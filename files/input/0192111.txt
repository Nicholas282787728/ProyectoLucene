If I were a professional (paid) critic, I'd feel obligated too. But as a fun film to watch for sheer entertainment, my wife and I thought it was a hoot. The plot isn't terribly important, but it involves an FBI agent (Prinze) trying to solve a diamond smuggling crime ring while falling for a pretty art restorer (Potter). It would be a very straight and un-funny film without the four models!!Potter's character needs a new place when she finds her boyfriend cheating on her, so finds what amounts to a large closet with a window for rent at $500 a month (cash, please, if you can) in a luxury apartment that is given to four models. They like to rent out the extra room for a little spending money. But these models are funny, say the darndest things, fall over things, into things, and generally make the slapstick part of the film work. Along with a Great Dane that runs and knocks Potter down every time he sees her - except the last time!None of the acting is great, but it is all OK. The dialog is snappy and funny most of the time. Film fans who enjoy Dumb and Dumber, Happy Gilmore, and High Heels and Low Lifes would probably also enjoy Head Over Heels.  I rate it 7 of 10 for sheer fun.

It's also adorable romantic comedy, with a funny and somewhat original premise . . . at least, it's cobbled together from original premises, like the Rear Window setup where Amanda thinks she witnesses her obsession across the street, Jim, murdering someone.  Freddie Prinze Jr is completely irresistible, and Monica Potter's somewhat one-note nice-girl cuteness is made palatable by the insanity of her four supermodel roommates and her practical lesbian friend.  Watch this, laugh hard and don't be embarrassed, because this movie, even at its most poorly scripted moments, is earnestly trying to make you laugh, unlike most of today's prefab romantic comedies, whose earnestness is sheer manipulation.

Add in the director and at least 6 dudes had a hand in crafting this very female-centric film. How do you think that worked out? There are plenty of examples of one man with a singular vision writing a great story about women. Even two fellows combining their talents to spin a yarn about the fairer sex is somewhat common. But when 12 testicles try to create a romantic-comedy with half a dozen significant female characters and a leading man who's barely more than eye candy, the result has all the tenderness of an assembly line and as much charm as a baseball player scratching his crotch.You can forgive the conceit that Monica Potter is playing an average woman who moves in with 4 fashion models. I mean, this is Hollywood so a standout beauty like Potter is as close to average as their tiny brains can come. You can even forgive the models being played as the sympathetic cheering section for Potter's character, even though they're portrayed as stupid, shallow and materialistic. Though inappropriate for their role, that's far more personality than best friend characters usually get in rom-coms. What you can't forgive is how Head Over Heels is clearly broken up into three sections that are practically different genres.It starts out with 30 minutes that includes almost every rom-com cliché, including the woman walking in on her cheating boyfriend, a makeover musical montage and a romantic misunderstanding. That segues into a half hour parody of women in peril flicks, though somewhat in reverse. Here, the woman sees the guy kill someone and then falls in love with him. Everything wraps up with 30 minutes of action-comedy involving international smuggling, fisticuffs at a fashion show and a cunnilingus sight gag. Not a brief one, either. The bit goes on for the better part of 30 seconds in a PG-13 film. That must have been a proud day for the motion picture ratings board.Amanda (Monica Potter) is an art restorer with terrible judgment about men. When she catches her latest boyfriend cheating on her, she needs a new place to stay and gets taken in by 4 models (Shalom Harlow, Ivana Milicevic, Sarah O'Hare and Tomiko Fraser). Amanda is weak kneed at the sight of a handsome stranger (Freddie Prinze Jr.) who turns out to live in the building across the way, his apartment positioned just so Amanda can see in his windows any time she wants. At first she thinks he's a dreamboat, then Amanda remembers her awful luck with guys and looks for a flaw. He turns out to really be a dreamboat, then Amanda sees him beat some girl to death with a baseball bat. Her horror at that lasts less than 10 minutes and she's back mooning over him, only to eventually discover he has a big secret, just not any one she suspected.The bottom line on Head Over Heels is that it's badly written in exactly the way you'd expect when 5 or 6 chaps each stick their paws into a romantic-comedy stew. Here's a good example of what I mean. Amanda spends virtually all of the film in the company of the 4 models. They are her support system, her humorous foils and plot devices upon which a lot of the movie depends. Except, when Amanda is introduced to the audience she already has a best friend at her art restoration job, a friend which is then dispensed with so Amanda and the models can team up. Her original best friend is absent for at least 90% of the film and brought back at the end for a couple of jokes. So, why was the original best friend kept in the script? It's the same reason why the story shifts through three different genres. With so many separate creative voices, especially male ones, a single narrative vision could never emerge.Monica Potter is adorable, Freddie Prinze Jr. is generically handsome and Head Over Heels at least makes consistent attempts at being funny. A lot of those attempts are old hat and some are oddly crude, but a few laughs make it through. Yes, the characters are all morons and you don't actually care what happens to them. Reasonably appealing stars and an honest effort to entertain can sometimes be enough, however, and that might have been true here. The tripartite fiasco of the plot is what ultimately dooms this motion picture.This isn't as annoying as most bad rom-coms. That's not enough to make it worth anyone's time.

Monica Potter preserves portraits and lives with four brainless supermodels and they believe that Freddie Prinze Jr. murdered someone in the apartment across the way. She goes undercover with the brainless supermodels to find out whether this seemingly sweet guy is a killer. Mark Waters directs this crap half-heartedly and the reference to the great Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece Rear Window is obvious but the difference is that the Hitchcock film is engaging and suspenseful while the Waters film is merely stupid. Then we are given the Russian mob plus toilet humour complete with sound effects. Potter plays an idiot with weak knees who is constantly saying the wrong thing. She is featured in a scene where a dog jumps her from behind and appears to be humping her. This cannot be her best moment. This also ranks in a long list of terrible performances by Prinze Jr. whose identity will surprise no one. The four supermodels are also a bad distraction of complete overacting. None of them are given an ounce of personality and they greatly subtract any credibility every time they open their mouths. Absurd comedy should be tossed head over heels into the back of a garbage truck.

If you add up all the working brain cells that the four have you might have one functioning brain.She also meets Freddie Prinze, Jr. who's also in the fashion game and she can see right into his apartment and sees one night him commit a murder. Now how could this sexy guy be a murderer. Well ask such charming characters as Ted Bundy and if he were he'd tell you. Potter decides to investigate Prince which includes a wild night of sex with her model onlookers.If this was Prinze's idea of an adult role he should have stuck to films like Summer Catch and being a teen dream for a bit longer.

If the movie is a comedy and it makes you laugh, somebody must have done something right.  The humor is raunchy, but funny.  There isn't any profanity, but the sexual content makes up for that.  There is something wrong when Amanda comments on the fact that she slept with someone whose name she didn't even know. It furthers her cause as a victim of bad relationships, not really funny, but intended to garner sympathy.  Even in this age of promiscuity, it is hard to be sympathetic when she jumps in bed with a guy she's only met a few times.  No wonder her romantic life is in tatters.The reason I believe this movie flopped at the box office is it doesn't have a target audience.  Monica Potter isn't exactly a household name, so most guys are off target.  Freddie Prinze Jr. appeals mostly to young girls, who because of the strong sexual content, probably were not allowed to see the movie.  Personally, I would have liked to see more action, but hey, I'm a guy.  (Actually, my wife said it and I'm just agreeing with her.)  This movie would have benifited with an R rating, and I'm not talking about language or nudity, which rarely enhances a movie box office score.As a comedy, the movie succeeds, I laughed a lot.

With the minor exception of an absurd plot twist, Head Over Heels is a solid romantic comedy.  The movie flows fairly well, thanks in part to a classic screwball formula that sets a romantic encounter(between a charming Potter & Prinze) against a backdrop of a bizarre incident and a quartet of oddball characters(the models). Confine most of this hi-jinx to 2 New York apartments and you have one very cute and funny movie.Thankfully, Head Over Heels avoids the recent trend of using vulgar language, road-trip scenarios and offensive gross-out humour to deliver a laugh.  Instead, this movie relies on the clean harmless fun of situation comedy peppered with unconventional casting(eg. real supermodels). This type of nuts and bolts comedy may be short on creativity but it gets the job done.I expected very little from Head Over Heels due to a terrible ad campaign that marketed this movie as a modern cinderella story.

I was pleasantly surprised.  A fairly decent time waster.  Don't think too hard and you may just enjoy it.  Played as a VERY broad comedy, film loses its focus in the last third, but even still, there are some hilarious moments, especially from the four models.  Although I usually don't think she's all that magnetic a screen presence, Monica Potter is very good in this role (sounding exactly like a younger Julia Roberts, no wonder those rumors got spread).  Freddie Prinze, Jr. is rather inconsequential.  His part could've been played, more convincingly, by any other hot, young actor.  He didn't take away from the movie at all, he just didn't add anything in particular.  However, the film gets its best moments from the models.  There are some genuinely funny self-mocking moments from them and they play it great. A lot of the situations don't make any sense and the characters are fickle to say the least, especially Potter's.  One minute she's convinced that Prinze's character is a murderer, the next, she's falling all over him.  Whatever, like I said, don't think too hard.This movie should've really been a cable made-for.  It doesn't have the necessary elements to make it as a feature.  No major star power, extremely slight story, and broad, sometimes slapstick comedy.  Rather than risk a financial loss at the theaters, Universal might've had better luck with cable.  That way they don't have to rely on ticket sales that never came.  Most general audience's attention are gained by star power and event-type movies.  Smaller movies, unless they are art-house, independent pics, beloved my critics, usually don't fare as well as the major blockbusters, so this movie never really had a chance at the multiplexes.  But all in all, a generally decent time waster, good for some laughs and pretty faces.  Glad I paid $3 to rent it and not $10 to see it in the theater.

She was always attracted to the wrong guys, who, when caught in the middle of cheating, would say This isn't what it looks like.As a result of one too many heartbreaks, she tried to envelope herself in her work, which was restoring old paintings.

I am a big fan of romantic comedies but hate vulgar humor so this movie doesn't make an 8 for me, simply for that reason. If not for the vulgarity of some of the humor it probably would have, because this is a fun, zany modern romantic comedy. I love the party atmosphere, the spoofs on models(though these models MADE The movie.) Unfortunately for Fredy Prince Jr., while he was good, it was the females, in this movie that stole the show. Monica Potter is wonderful, the models are goofy yet so likable, always up to something and there's a bit of sex and the city in this. I could see women liking it more then men even though there are A lot of pretty women featured in this. But there's so many BAD romantic comedies out there. At least this isn't boring.I happen to HATE bathroom humor in movies. The movie really made an error in some of it's scenes and that is why it only gets a 7 from me and not an 8. I think the movie was trying to appeal to EVERYONE, (the teen crowd, the over 21 clubbing crowd, the chick flick lovers, fans of pure slapstick, etc etc). The movie should have made up it's mind what type of movie it was. In spite of the disgusting, ridiculous few scenes thrown in, I liked this so much it surprises me! Usually any movie that has this kind of humor would not get a 7 from me.But there's just something about this.

Fortunately his latest film, Head Over Heels, is best suited for that very same Teen Beat-reading audience... and absolutely no one else.Prinze plays Jim Winston, an asthmatic FBI agent who unexpectedly bumps into Amanda (Monica Potter), an art restorer looking for a man to make her go weak in the knees.  First knee-weakening rights actually go the massive Great Dane Jim is dog-walking, and the pooch becomes the catalyst for Jim and Amanda's initial meeting when he gets looses, runs down Amanda, and begins humping her.  Along that line, Jim and Amanda's ensuing relationship can best be described as love at first hump.After finding her previous boyfriend (Timothy Olyphant) in bed with another woman, Amanda has just left him and moved into an absolutely gorgeous apartment with the last four non-smoking models in Manhattan. Jim, conveniently enough, lives in an apartment just across the way--and within view of Amanda's new pad.  In fact, Amanda and her rail-thin roomies spend a great deal of their time watching Jim, who despite being a tough, undercover agent, is apparently deathly afraid of closing his blinds. Then again, in a city as friendly as The Big Apple, why would anyone want to close their blinds?During one of these Jim-ogling sessions, however, Amanda watches Jim and a lady friend return and (gasp!) shut the blinds.  She then sees what she thinks is Jim clubbing his companion to death.  Did her dream just brutally murder a young woman?  Could this dog-walking stud be a cold-hearted killer?  And where did he get those cute eggshell blinds?Since this movie is definitely a contender for Best Picture... well, at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, perhaps... I won't spoil the ending, though it does involve smuggled diamonds, a fashion show, car chases, some yelling, and the Russian mob.  What I will say is that this movie misses several opportunities to cash in on hi-quality laughs, and instead often resorts to toilet humor.Amanda's model roommates (played by real-life models Shalom Harlow, Sarah O'Hare, Tomiko Fraser, and Ivana Milicevic) provide some of the funniest moments of the film.  For instance, Candi (O'Hare), the blond Aussie bombshell, has several cosmetic surgeries throughout the film at the requests of her handlers.  First her earlobes are asymmetrical, then there's something wrong with her nose, and finally her eyes... from which comes some delightfully silly slapstick humor.  It is obvious that all four of the models are having fun with their roles, knowing full well that this isn't exactly Casablanca that they're co-starring in.  Hell, it's not even Clueless.Unfortunately, this sense of over-the-top fun and self-ridicule displayed by the models is not used enough.  Instead, it is passed over in favor of gross-out humor, such as in an unfortunately memorable scene in which Amanda and three of the four models break into Jim's apartment to search for evidence that might reveal his suspected homicidal tendencies. Of course, Jim returns earlier than expected and the three runway gals hide in the shower.  Jim then spends considerable gastro-time in the bathroom himself, odoriferously exorcising his digestive demons.  The models treat us to a good thirty seconds of cringing, nose pinching, and squirming. Personally, I would have preferred more outrageous Worship me, pity me... sigh... I'm a model banter--or even another operation for Candi. Incidentally, if Prinze was hoping to make the career transition to grown-up actor with this role, as has been suggested, someone definitely should have advised him that impressive cinematic flatulence does not constitute growth as an actor.All of that said, if Ace Ventura Pet Detective is one of your favorite movies, give Head Over Heels a try.  If you're too young to remember Reagan's presidency, give Head Over Heels a try.  If you're pre-bed ritual involves kissing all of your Freddie Prinze Jr. posters goodnight, give Head Over Heels a try.  Otherwise, you can wait until this bonanza of often-gross humor, occasionally laughable lines, and missed opportunities comes to cable.

I was laughing the first 15 minutes.  The introduction is quite funny.  But it's all downhill from there.  The comedy is so flat and one-dimensional.  The characters of the models are complete stereotypes.  I can tell the screenwriters didn't do a lick of research on the field.  We have a stereotypical Australian woman, who spends day in and day out exfoliating and has a history of incest.  I was surprised to find out the actress is a native Australian!  Why she thought it was funny to degrade her own people is beyond me.  We also have the stereotypical Russian model, with an accent as fake as her looks.  All four models remind me of the beauty pageant contestants in Miss Congeniality, only Sandra Bullock's comic charm couldn't save the day.  So we pretty much have nothing to work with in that department.  Monica Potter is a fine actress, who's turned in impressive performances--one as Robin Williams' love interest in Patch Adams.  Her job in this movie is to stand around and act wooden, while everyone around her make fools out of themselves.  Same goes for Freddie Prinze, Jrs' poorly-drawn character.  To prove how shallow HOH's humor is, there's a scene where the girls are searching through Freddie's apartment, and for no apparent reason we have a gratuitous bathroom sequence where the girls are hiding in the shower covering their noses while Freddie is on the toilet with the runs.  For all you girls out there who want to see this movie because of your boy Freddie...don't even think about it!  I'm sure all your fantasies will be terminated.  Well, maybe.  I'm sure if any hot actress had to perform a mock diarrhea scene, I wouldn't be able to lust after her anymore.  But I don't know how it looks through a female's eyes.  To add to this film's gratuitously crude humor, there's also a scene where the girls are hiding in a restaurant bathroom.  They hear two plumbers in the next stall, who start using phrases like stick it in the hole and the girls assume they're having sex.  The joke is handled so poorly, and was done much better in Mickey Blue Eyes.  Anyway, the plumbers work on the toilets and BAM!!! Crap comes shooting out of the toilets and onto the girls.  These are all jokes that could've been funny, if they were handled with any hint of wit or structure.Aside from the good introduction, the film meanders on without a laugh.

I regret I did.The story starts as Potter finds her boyfriend cheating, and her looking for another place to live. Now this is where the movie makes a mistake. Normally, I'm not that big on complaining about small details in a movie but when the movie sucks, I have to comment. What happened?Potter's character decides to live with 4 models, who apparently need her 500 dollars a month for pocketmoney... but why? As we progress in the movie it shows these models live for free, get thousands of dollars for their modelling and when they have a $1200 dinner the check gets picked up by some boyfriend... Just a mistake? Well, an annoying one.Then let me talk about a second mistake. It is a pretty depraved one. First of, we see Potter attacked quite sexually by a dog. And it's intented to have a sexual meaning. It really made me sick. Not nearly as much though as the comments of the 'Australian' model, who talkes about her uncle playing charades (or something) with her, completely naked. Such stupid jokes about phedophiles and incest I find hard to take in what is a romantic comedy. So please, next time, take them out.Back again to the story and Amanda, Potter's character. One day she meets Jim (Prinze Jr.), and (surprise surprise) falls for him. It turns out he's the neighbour across the street. They meet again at a party, once more on the street and... fall for each other. Why? Erm... dunno. But it fits nicely in the story I guess. Now all this happens during the first 30 minutes. So you know there's gonna be a mix-up, a surprise, something that's gonna drive the two lovers out of each other. Is it an old boyfriend? A secret from the past? No, this is where the movie takes quite a different turn than all those other romantic comedies... (TAKE WARNING, SPOILERS BEGIN NOW)... One night, Amanda sees how Jim kills a woman across the street (well, at least, that's what she thinks).Now, this is where the movie can go two ways. Either Jim IS the killer and it turns out to be a thriller kinda movie, or he isn't (and we all know it) and it's just a goofy comedy. But the movie doesn't decide... So we hear Jim talking about how 'the girl isn't a problem anymore' which can be interpreted a thousand ways. So we just don't know. But then, the key moment in the movie. Amanda finds out the woman she thinks she saw really was murdered, so she knows (well, she thinks she knows )) Jim is the killer, and she confronts him... and finds out he ISN'T, but an FBI agent pretending. So we, the public, only think for less than 10 seconds he really is the killer... this is all the excitement the movie offers. As we say in Holland, it's neither meat nor fish (I love that expression). So let's just think what would happen if Jim flat-out said 'yeah I killed the b*tch'. Now, this would have fitted his role. Us at home would really think he IS a killer. Excitement. Now THAT would be an OK movie...The rest of the movie is just a silly wrap-up of a bad thriller kinda movie (Miss Congeniality comes to mind). Only good part is that the end is at a fashion-show by Alfredo's... I really hope that's a tribute to Hitchcock (and his Rear Window). For the rest yuck! 2/10.

A Freddie Prinze genre movie would consist of terrible jokes, bad acting and an awkward/predictable plot-line.  Being par for the course, Head Over Heels has all these in spades.Jim (Prinze) is the object of affection of Amanda (Monica Potter) who meets her Prince Charming after his Great Dane he's walking assaults her at the park.  She falls in love with him, so much so she feels it necessary to spy on him in his apartment across the way with her telescope.  There, she sees him murder a woman with a baseball bat and then cover-up the body. But does she call the police like a normal human being? Of course not. Why? Because he's Freddie Prinze, the boy with an infectious smile that can transcend even murder. From there, the misunderstandings and hilarity ensue. Head Over Heels tries to cash in on the toilet-humour, which can be funny (see Dumb and Dumber).  But the writers can't even get the cheap laughs right. For example, there's a scene where Amanda and her model friends (don't even get me started on them) sneak into Jim's apartment while he's out to see if they can find anything that might explain the horrific scene she witnessed. Surprise!! Jim comes home unexpectedly and the girls find themselves trapped in his shower while he takes a number two - a disgustingly smelly and loud number two.  There's just something that doesn't sit about a romantic lead taking a dump, even if it is supposed to be a comedy. Mind you, it was a pretty good metaphor for this movie. "}{"Title":"Not just bad.

Total poppycock! HEAD OVER HEELS boasts, quite possibly, one of the dumbest screenplays ever written. There are a lot of badly-written screenplays out there, but this is probably one of the worst in recent memory. It starts out with a good girl liking a good guy. Then the good girl thinks he may not actually be Mr. Perfect after all. Then she suspects him to have committed murder and everything goes downhill. Had it been a script for a thriller, it might have been good for brainless fun, but as a romantic comedy, with a pointless gags and bathroom humor, it's just lethal. A total train-wreck from the moment that Great Dane leaped on Monica Potter.Potter plays Amanda, your typical nice girl who restores Renaissance paintings for a living. She then moves to a flat where she shares a room with four partying models which she gets along with finely. But then there's the good-looking Jim Winston (Freddie Prinze Jr.), who may be the perfect guy. But when she sees him seemingly striking a woman and disposing hr body, she's about to change her mind. And the story only gets sillier and dumber (even by comedy standards) as it goes. As if that wasn't bad enough, director Mark Waters throws in some gross out bathroom humor with horribly unwatchable results. It even rips off bits from REAR WINDOW and the knife-throwing from the silly HER ALIBI in the process.Sure, it adds up and it might have kept you guessing, but this film is just borderline unwatchable. The comedy isn't funny, the script is dumb and there's not a good actor in sight. What might have been a light disposable affair, HEAD OVER HEELS is an insulting and ridiculous mess, and probably the worst of its kind in a long time as well. Rating 0 out of 5.

The humor element has to do with the fact she is living with several ditzy models who help her in her quest to discover the truth. Much merry mayhem ensues. Freddie Prinze Jr. is the object of her affection, and he is harmless enough. The beauteous Monica Potter is the enraptured gal, and she's just pretty enough, and employs that Julia Roberts voice of hers, to make her worth watching. One of the running gags is that while Potter is living with a bunch of models, she herself is not a model. So we have some mildly funny business about her getting all gussied up, a la Sandra Bullock in MISS CONGENIALITY. The rest of the cast in this lame flick shoulda stood in bed, although the four real-life models portraying Potter's new roommates give it their best. I often wonder who dreams up films like this, and who the heck goes to see this stuff.

I wouldn't pay a cent to see it, but I don't regret having blown two hours on it. It's an awkward and weird comedy, too, one that made me wonder whether I was actually awake while watching it. Looking over the comments confirms my fear yes, there is a scene where the dumb ingenue gets humped by a giant dog. (We're not just talking her leg here, either.)Very, very creepy. Not funny. The dog in question is being walked by Freddie Prinze Jr, and the unfortunate woman is the breathlessly ditzy Monica Potter. Is this supposed to serve as a romantic meet cute? (To use Ebert's term!) Blech. The supermodels are nice eye-candy but not terribly entertaining or charismatic, though they seem to enjoy poking fun at their industry. That fact alone makes them a lot more personable. The dumb model jokes get old fast, though. Yeah, yeah, we know that they're ditzy. The fact that they seem completely out of touch with reality is a little more amusing, but there's only so many times you can make the same crack about plastic surgery.I'm not totally sure where all the comparisons to Rear Window come in, incidentally. The plot is completely and entirely different with the exception of the fact that both movies involve a potential murder and a window. C'mon, people--if you think that Head Over Heels is anything like Rear Window, you weren't paying attention to one or both of them.The movie does go downhill fast, though, going from entertainingly stupid to boring and disjointed about halfway through. Freddie Prinze Jr. doesn't help, of course; in 2001 he was just the flavor-of-the-month as far as romantic leads go. He's not very talented. Monica Potter isn't much better; she's basically a low-rent version of Julia Roberts with a smaller and less demonic mouth. (But seeing as how I don't like Roberts either, maybe I'm not the best person to ask.) The movie attempts to make her seem like the intelligent roommate, but she comes out looking like an insecure moron whose main charm comes from the fact that she's clumsy and falls down a lot.

She is really communicative and can be as expressive as a child. She is lovable. In the first part of the movie she strongly reminded me a young Monica Vitti; an Italian bright actress. Even in the look. I wonder if she knows Monica Vitti and I would like to know what does she think about her. The first part of the movie was very promising. In the second part, the movie is a bit too banal, even for a movie intentionally based on common places. Anyway all the clueless situations in the movie are there to put in evidence the story of love in it. So the movie is not stupid or clueless itself, nor a file of gags. In the end, head over heels wants us to notice the value of sincerity, contrasting with all the incredible, absurd and clueless situations of life. Amanda is the only one that, in the middle of confusion, tries to keep her head on the shoulders and coherently searches for a true love. But she is a bit unsure. So Jim/Bob is the x along the story until the happy end. So the movie speaks about... you know, the old good sincerity that wins against appearance and oddity. The old good values.

Because of that, and I was short on cash, she offered to buy snacks.Amanda Pierce,a romance-starved woman, moves into a model apartment and spots the man of her dreams living in the apartment across from the one she lives in, but is afraid when she thinks she sees him brutally murder someone in the apartment.  But that won't stop Amanda, no matter what.  Dashing Jim Winston (Freddie Prinze Jr.), a fashion designer, is really an FBI Agent named Bob Smoot, who is undercover in the apartment, and begins to romance Amanda, and the two find they have fallen head over heels in love.  The definition of head over heels in love is when you love someone enough to go weak in the knees when you see them.  At first sight, Amanda collapses on her jelly-like knees, and Jim falls for her too.This was a GREAT movie, and I'm shocked it didn't do better in the theater. My best friend and I left gushing over how great it was, while all the younger girls leaving were not saying much about it.  In my opinion, it was probably not a movie for younger teenagers (I was 18 when I first saw this). This was a great vehicle for Prinze, who was playing his first adult role after a string of excellent teen movies, among the better that I've seen. It was romantic and a much cuter film than many younger girls would appreciate.  I'm beyond teen films (they don't spark my interest, never have), with the exception of The Breakfast Club, (my favorite teen flick), St. Elmo's Fire, 16 Candles, She's All That, and Down to You.  The plot of this film never lags in interest, and kept me interested.  I was almost disappointed when it was over, but loved watching Jim/Bob and Amanda together--it was too cute.My favorite parts of Head Over Heels was when Amanda first met Jim, and how she collapsed on her knees (and he says something so cute--Maybe you should get those knees checked), when Amanda goes to the party all fancied up, and Jim isn't into the whole party crowd, and the scene where he comes into his apartment and takes the huge power crap while the models are hiding in his bathtub.  Yikes!  My best friend and I were laughing the loudest during this part!All in all, this was a great film, and should have been given more of a chance to shine.  Freddie Prinze Jr.'s first adult role proved to work for him (he'd go on to play several more adult roles between then and now, including my personal favorite Freddie movie Scooby Doo), and Monica Potter was excellent as Amanda.

So Amanda begins to stalk him to find out the truth of the situation. Thankfully this was one of Freddie Prinze Jr.'s last films before his popularity died down and girls started flocking to see other teen film hunks, but for the most part the film is trying to be original but is still burdened with all the clichés present in every romantic comedy. The main problem here is not with Prinze or Monica Potter because they both work well together and the girls who play the models are sometimes funny, although often annoying, but the simple fact is that is not romantic not is it all that funny. It's sort of neutral, you won't die laughing but you won't want to burst into tears either. The blunt of the jokes are all gross-out potty humour and homosexual bashing then when we find ourselves heading for a romantic moment the scene is cut short and some stupid slapstick bit follows directly after, totally ruining the mood. It that's not enough, the film takes a turn to action towards the end and loses any small amount of emotional impact it had up to this point. There is nothing here to really love but there is nothing here to really hate either, it's just kind of there. It's nice to see someone out there is trying to bring new elements to the romantic comedy genre but the execution was weak and somewhere along the line the romance clashed with the comedy and we were left with nothing, the story was also much too over the top to be believable, maybe next time.

But it has a PERFECT home viewing feel. Not that it has low production values, because it certainly looks nice, and is well made film. Rent the DVD, watch it in Widescreen, it's a nicely shot film. Anyway, the plot is simple, and fun, a loose remake of 'Rear Window', but instead of a crippled Stewart, we get a gorgeous Monica Potter, surrounded by 4 beautiful models (what more can a guy want on a Tuesday evening?? or any evening for that matter?!!), and a topless Freddie Prinze Jr, with his trademark grin for the ladies. There are some really funny moments in the film, the script is decent, the pace is excellent and doesn't get boring. At 80 mins this film never outstays its welcome.What more can i say? looking for a funny, romantic, frivilous film, to go with your pizza, popcorn and coke, then look no further than 'Head Over Heels'. I watch a lot of films, and i'd like to think I know a crap film when i see one, and i know when a film deserves half marks -- and this is none of these things.A solid 7.5/10 romantic comedy.

Its an average romantic comedy that borrows a little bit from Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window(1954).  Ultimately fails as a romantic comedy because of the generic feel of the romantic emotions between Freddie Prinze Jr. and Monica Potter.  Monica Potter gives a reasonable performance in the role of a young fashion model.  A disappointing followup for the director to the darkly comical and provocative, House of Yes(1997).

It has some good moments, but it also has some stuff that would be lame in a mediocre sitcom. Fortunately, you can fast-forward watching at home, so what would be intolerable in a theater becomes ignorable. (There are a couple of poop joke sequences in this movie that I find inexplicable in a romantic comedy -- whatever possessed them to do this?)On the plus side, Prinze and Potter are attractive, talented at light comedy, and they have enough chemistry to be a plausible couple. The actresses that play the models are competent and there are a few nice model jokes (some belabored), but I could have done without the makeover scene...I've seen both of the leads in plenty of other stuff that's better, and I hope to see them in the future. This was potentially a charming movie (the first 15 minutes is quite good), but someone got lazy and it's just a pleasant, brainless diversion. If you haven't seen all the good movies in this genre, such as Simply Irresistible or The Truth About Cats and Dogs, see one of those. But if you've seen all of the A-list romantic comedies and want something light, this could work.

However, this is not one of them. This movie could have been a real hit. Don't get me wrong- the plot is actually interesting and it has some hysterical scenes, but Freddie is just too darn young! I know the plot called for an older woman (if you could call Potter old) falling for a younger man, but the poor guy's barely of legal drinking age masking as a fashion exec. He almost looks like a little kid dressing up in dad's suits. Of course, only in a movie could a woman rent an absolutely fabulous apartment for $500 a month and have gorgeous models as roommates, but hey, it's fun to dream. This is just a cute chick flick that had a great idea, but wrong leading man. Sorry, Freddie.

He looks good in ads and on TV, but I'd never seen a Freddie Prinze vehicle.  Now I have.  It was a completely preposterous setup for a movie, from the idea that Old Masters are restored by painting new faces on them, to the notion of paying $500 for a room just down the block from the Met, to the notion of a modeling agency giving these untested models a fabulous apartment just to keep them under contract, even though they are not used by the modeling agency.  And then, the undercover scheme that Mr. Prinze is involved in (something about diamonds being sewn onto dresses from Antwerp instead of rhinestones, as a means of smuggling diamonds into the US) strained credulity.  Still, there's a certain pleasure in watching this caper.  It's not all bad, and the people are cute.  And one scene covers the models in liquid turd, which makes me happy.

One  night, she notices how Jim (Freddie Prinze jr.), her new boyfriend, kills a young woman in his apartment across the street. She begins to observe him...Strange, when I go to the movies with low  expectations, I´m pleasantly surprised at the  end - well, most of the times. Head over heels is the best example. In my opinion this film is  absolutely underrated, what first spoiled me to  watch it. It amazed me that some people found the humor dirty. I didn´t found it dirty at all -  okay, with the exception of the toilet scenes... I would rather call it black humor with a little bit of slapstick. This movie works brilliant, when you regard it as a thriller-parody or, of course, as a romantic-comedy. Speaking of romantic -  the chemistry between Freddie Prinze jr. and Monica Potter was wonderful! Head over heels is even  funnier than Miss Congeniality. A refreshing comedy and a perfect feelgood-movie!

After some time the movie transforms into a thriller, but in the end its a romance again. Additionally, there is the typical black There's something about Mary humor.Monica Potter and Freddie Prinze Jr just fit well together. Freddie Prinze Jr has the bad habit of selecting movie partners which look too old for him, such as Saffron Burrows in Wing Commander, or Claire Forlani in Boys and Girls. But even if Monica Potter is even older than the other two, she and Prinze just develop the right kind of chemistry. This loverpair is believable, even if one would meet them in real life.I liked this movie myself very much, I've seen it already two time and I want to watch it again, but unfortunately I don't think I can really recommend it in general.

The only bad thing I can say about this movie is that it might depress you if you are a single female.  Freddie Prinze Jr's character is The Perfect Guy smart, sweet, funny and romantic.

Guess what?!? Head Over Heels is the same movie, just replace the barmaids with fashion models.So, Monica Potter (Patch Adams) moves to New York, and just like everyone in New York does, she finds an apartment for just $500 and is rooming with 4 stunningly beautiful models. Plus, they have a big window across the way so they can see Freddie Prinze Jr.'s apartment. It's a great view for watching him do sit-ups, pull-ups, basically lots of things without his shirt on. She thinks he's just dreamy, when suddenly, she thinks she sees him murder someone, AND THAT'S WHEN THE HIJINKS BEGIN!!! If I told you that the film also included smuggling diamonds, the Russian Mafia, and the CIA, would you even believe me?Okay, let me cut to the chase, this is yet another horrible movie for 2001 (Save the Last Dance, The Wedding Planner, etc.). The script is completely lame, and the two leads deliver their lines clearly showing that they have no talent for comedy. Also, just like The Wedding Planner, the movie doesn't know what it wants to be. It's this supposedly sweet romantic comedy, when all of a sudden, there's all this lewd humor, as if it was picked up off the cutting room floor of an Adam Sandler or Jim Carrey movie. Cross dressing janitors, toilets that back up and spew garbage, R-rated one-liners about having the runs? I mean, I laughed at some of them but they're all just out of nowhere - they don't fit with the rest of the movie. Well, okay, let me be fair, if you're looking for a movie where you can see Freddie Prinze Jr. on the toilet, then I've found a winner for you!

Her looks, actions and even her crying seem to be mirror images of Hollywood's most prolific actress, and if it sounds like I can't get over it - you try watching this movie and not think of Julia Roberts.Although Hitchcock's `Rear Window' perfected the general idea, the film is creative.  As Amanda and her newly discovered supermodel roommates (who are always a pleasure to look at) spy on their young attractive neighbor they quickly discover he may have killed a young woman.  In her pursuit to discover the truth she decides this guy may be the love of her life. I guess in the world of love, murder is a trait easily gotten over.The comic moments are plentiful and watching supermodels with IQs lower than their apartment numbers is always entertaining.  Also much of the dialogue, involving mistaken word choices, leads to many embarassing moments for the characters and laughter for the audience.  The excessive use of bathroom humor and the ease to which the story resolves itself are two problems that you'll have a hard time ignoring.  In the end the casting may have been awkward but since big screen charm is a major factor in Hollywood, you can expect to see Prinze Jr, and Potter in many more films to come.

The humour is so bad that it is at times embarrassing to watch the movie. The script is utterly awful, employing the kind of gags that are on a Police Academy 6 level. And as if that weren't bad enough, a lot of the gags are given to the four fashion-models, who are the worst kind of actresses one can imagine it is their eagerness to comedically please that is the source of most of the embarrassment. Another problem is the casting of Potter, who simply doesn't look that much different from the four models she moves in with - which sort of defeats the whole purpose her character is supposed to be different in mind AND body from those four, so the casting of a non-thin and sufficiently shorter actress would have made more sense. But sense wasn't what the makers of this malarkey cared for. "}]
