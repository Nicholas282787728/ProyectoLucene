[{"Title":"Deserved to do better","Date":"25 October 2001","Score":"30 out of 38 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  Henry Selick's first feature, The Nightmare Before Christmas, was a modern classic.  His next, James and the Giant Peach, had most of the things that made Nightmare great - heavily diluted.  One thing that weakened Selick's second movie was his decision to begin and end with live action footage, when the glory of both Nightmare and Peach lay in skilful, sharp, gorgeous stop-motion animation.In Monkeybone Selick has watered the original batch of Nightmare juice still more (note to Selick it's time to stop mining this lode - if you make a fourth feature, get a new look), with at least half of the footage lacking the visual trademarks that were probably the reason for making the film in the first place.  There WAS some stop-motion footage thrown in, probably it's for old time's sake.Still, this is a better, more memorable movie than Selick's last one, and certainly not nearly as bad as the miserable box-office returns and scathing reviews would lead you to believe.  Yes, the film has its flaws, but if you were to judge from its reception you'd think it didn't have ANY virtues - which simply isn't true.  There's Brendan Fraser, for a start.  How can you not like Stu Miley, or the way Fraser plays him?  (If you want to see Fraser's charm wasted, see Bedazzled.)  At one point Stu is forced to temporarily occupy another body (Chris Kattan), and we instantly transfer our affections to the new actor without giving the matter a second thought - which is more remarkable than it sounds, and shows that Fraser really had been WORKING to get us to like Stu.Then there's Downtown, which you must admit, looks good.  It's more of a visual hodgepodge than Selick's previous two worlds (the first of which owes its look largely to Tim Burton), partly because it was realised through an ill-chosen mixture of costume, CGI, stop-motion and set design ... our eyes must constantly adjust, yet the overall look is strong enough to make it worth the effort.As for the film's flaws, well, they've been greatly exaggerated.  I suppose there were (as several American critics complained) some bodily-function-based jokes, but I can't recall that many - certainly not as many or as witless as in Shrek, and besides, at least some of the jokes in Monkeybone are actually funny.  That's because they're character-based, and not solely reliant on the alleged shock value of someone suddenly farting or burping.All that's really wrong with Monkeybone is that it lacks the brilliance a premise this bizarre demands.  Yeah, well, big deal.  So unlike Selick's first feature it's not a masterpiece.  It's still an entertaining, competently made film with a good, solid story, more than inventive enough to justify having been made.

Its run in theaters was too brief, which doesn't do a movie like this justice.  The imagery was surreal and disturbing, in a nice sort of way.  It was interesting to see the strange denizens of Downtown, the mythological characters, the dead celebrities and so many others.  The animated Monkeybone keeps the action and the comedy at a fever pitch.  It all may have been too much for the average moviegoer.  But I say this weird kaleidoscope is worth a look.

Monkeybone is a visually delightful, darkly humorous, and totally refreshing fantasy flick full of great special effects, likable characters, and a style that mixes everything from Brazil and Cool World to Hellraiser and Eraserhead. It reminded me of  Dark City, Freaked, Forbidden Zone and the work of Sid and Marty Krofft, but at the same time completely fresh and original.Monkeybone does suffer from some flaws, but they seem like the manipulations of some behind-the-scenes tinkering to make the movie more normal. The most visible scars occur when our hero Stu  Miley (Brendan Fraser, who is quickly becoming a great comedic actor) first arrives in Monkeybone's nightmare land. These early scenes in the fantasy world seem rushed and poorly plotted. I hope there's a special edition DVD or something to see more stuff. But the stuff that was left in is great. I couldn't believe what I was seeing sometimes- Stu's black and white surgery nightmare was one of the creepiest things I've seen on the big screen, and Bob Odenkirk appears as a organ-hungry doctor in scenes that seem to be taken right out of his HBO series Mr. Show. Chris Kattan is outstanding, providing some hilarious, Re-Animator-style hi-jinx as Organ Doner Stu, Dave Foley is also funny as Stu's manager, and Whoopie Goldberg is really good as Death, whose head explodes when she gets mad.But the real stars here are the fantasy characters who inhabit the nightmare town. Like in The Nightmare Before Christmas, the background characters are just as cool-looking and diverse as the leads. It's a shame that more time isn't spent dwelling in this world or in Death's land, and that most of the movie takes place in the real world.Anyway, see this movie while you can- it'll probably be out of theaters by the time I finish writing thi- too late.

The first cartoon sequence explains &#150; in graphic detail &#150; how the character of 'Monkey Bone' got his name; and it is not something that can be repeated in this forum.Unfortunately, when I went to the matinée the audience was primarily children.When Stu Miley (S Miley &#150; get it?) is tricked into staying in the 'Downunder' (the place where people in a coma go to) to provide nightmares for the denizens of 'Downunder' the film becomes much too frightening for children; but more visually elaborate and stimulating for adults.The sound track starts out strong and only gets better.Brendan Fraser is wonderful as Stu the comic book author who has a very dark side to him. Bridget Fonda is underutilized as Dr Julie McElroy the sweet and good-natured girlfriend of Stu. Megan Mullally as Kimmy, Stu's sister who wants to pull the plug on Stu (though it is never real clear why) essentially reprises her role as 'Karen' from the television show 'Will and Grace' &#150; but she is always a delight to watch.Rose McGowan ('Scream') is a visual treat as Kitty &#150; the lone citizen of 'Downunder' that is willing to assist Stu in returning to the real world. Whoopi Goldberg is fabulous as Death &#150; just the right amount of sly wickedness that you would expect of an embodied death.But Chris Kattan does a real star turn as the Organ Doner &#150; his physical comedy and outrageous antics as a recently deceased gymnast are truly riotous and quite different from the characters he has played in past films or currently plays on Saturday Night Live &#150; it is worth seeing this film just for his performance.The plot is actually fairly complicated and the graphics and visual style are brilliant and mind-blowing; but again, this is not a film for children. However, most adults that can see the possibility of the humour that might actually lie in death will certainly get a kick out of it.

The ornery Monkeybone represents all of Stu's repressed feelings, you see. This is not uncommon among cartoonists or comic-book artists (or, for that matter, any artist); the product on the page is often the result of the demons within the artist's tortured soul.   Anyway, Stu has a lovely girlfriend named Julie (Bridget Fonda), who just happens to be a doctor. Monkeybone's about to hit big, and Stu's friend/agent (David Foley) is trying his damnedest to merchandise the hell out of the uncontrollable penis with legs. (There's a not-so-subtle symbolism at work here, of course; Stu represses his emotions, including all sexual feelings, and releases them only in the form of Monkeybone on the page.)   The day that deals for the commercialization of Monkeybone (reluctantly by Stu, of course) are made, tragedy strikes. A freak car accident leaves Stu in a coma, although somehow his girlfriend escapes unharmed. So there he is, lying in a hospital bed. Trust me, folks, there's comedy afoot here. We're only now getting to it.   While clinically dead, Stu finds himself in Hell. Everyone down there knows him, because he's suffered through nightmares for many, many years (and they've served to inspire him in his artistry, too). In 1991, there was a movie called Cool World that covered some of the same ground. In that film, cartoonist Gabriel Byrne ran into all of his old creations - in this one, Stu finds that the denizens down there have been audience to his nightmares since they began, and they've been counting on him to churn out more. Keeps 'em alive, apparently. Oh, but just to complicate things, Julie the doc has found out what causes nightmares. Actually, I guess that actually makes things nice and simple, not more complex. What's worse, down in Hell (actually, an offshoot of Hell called Downtown), Monkeybone is quite the center of attention, and even has a standup act that humiliates the reserved and introverted Stu.    The movie really consists of two main parts Stu down in Hell (although not quite dead yet in real life), trying to find a way back up; and Stu back on terra firma, trying to Save The Day. What connects the two parts is that the nefarious Monkeybone, who's ostensibly been helping Stu to get an exit pass has actually schemed to return to the land of the living himself - in Stu's body. So that's where the hijinks really begin; at least, that was the plan. Once Monkeybone gets back up there, things seem to fall into a familiar plotline, which is a shame. There are many scenes down in the underworld that are positively funny, including Whoopi Goldberg as the Lord of the Dead. Oh, and some good bits with Grim Reaper recruits. And the sets! VERY good, fascinating stuff. If you're a fan of scenes, how things look - set design, set decoration, the whole bit - then this movie has oodles of eye candy. It's very well designed.   And here's a bit of praise for someone I thought I'd never give it to Chris Kattan. See, after Monkeybone returns to Earth in Stu's body, Stu has to find a way back up there himself. He's sent back in the body of a gymnast who was just killed in a car wreck (broken neck). The scenes of Stu waking up on the dissection table then being pursued by a mob of angry pathology doctors anxious to get his organs (which, of course, were supposed to be donated) are priceless, as is the bit of how Stu quickly copes with his broken-neck problem.   There's a lot to look at here, and although the characters themselves are rather cardboard (and Fraser himself, while amiable, might be a little miscast), I think this was an overlooked movie. It has everything Cool World had back in 1991, except it also has (pardon the pun) a soul. This one made you like Stu and root for him, which is (of course) essential to any silly comedy. This one's just a silly comedy with some bite to it. "},{"Title":"For Lots of Laughs (Go Somewhere Else)","Date":"18 July 2001","Score":"8 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  	The Fantasy genre is pretty much wide open, which allows a filmmaker to take an audience where he will, without the constraint of parameters of realism or any significant frames of reference.  It's a kind of create-as-you-go market, and it's hard to go wrong, especially with the special effects and technology available today.  Mixing fantasy and comedy, however, is a whole different thing, and even in the abstract it is bound to wind up in a very subjective arena, and to be successful it must be created and presented with great care, vision and an innate sense of what works by the filmmaker.  `Monkeybone,' directed by Henry Selick and written by Sam Hamm is-- well-- none of those things, which is unfortunate for everyone involved with the project, but mostly for the unsuspecting audience upon which it is sprung.	The movie begins with a short `Monkeybone' cartoon, a pilot created from a popular comic strip written by Stu Miley (Brendan Fraser), which has just been picked up by Comedy Central and contracted for a number of episodes.  The cartoon depicts the origins of Monkeybone himself, and the appeal is purely infantile (and that's being kind).  After the premiere of this animated masterpiece, Stu attends the promo party with his girlfriend, Dr. Julie McElroy (Bridget Fonda), who is indirectly responsible for the existence of Monkeybone in the first place.  Stu had suffered from a sleep disorder due to nightmares since he could remember, and it was Dr. Julie who turned his life around, treating him at the sleep clinic into which he checked himself when he finally couldn't take it anymore.  At that point in his life, Stu's cartoons ranged from the gruesome to the downright disturbed-- all extensions of his nightmares; then Julie suggested drawing with his left hand instead of his right, and the result was the emergence of Monkeybone, who apparently is supposed to be the flip side of his nightmares.  Which may be true for Stu, but not necessarily for the audience.	Monkeybone himself (with voice provided by John Turturro sounding like he's been inhaling helium), is-- far from being funny, cute or endearing in any way, shape or form-- an annoying little spud who grates on the senses from the moment he appears on screen, which beyond the opening cartoon, begins with Stu's descent into `Down Town,' the land of nightmares residing within his own mind into which he slips when a freak accident puts him in a coma.  It's a freakish place, a kind of demented `Toon Town,' populated by (besides the ever-present and irritating Monkeybone) such illustrious  nightmare mongers as Edgar Allan Poe, Jack the Ripper, Lizzy Borden, Attila the Hun and Stephen King (yes, the real King, in a cameo appearance).  The crux of Stu's problem is that he has to get his hands on an `Exit Pass,' in order to defy Death (Whoopi Goldberg), and make his escape back into the land of the living.  	Brendan Fraser has to be given credit for not being afraid to take on challenging (some would say questionable) roles; from the comic antics of `George of the Jungle,' to the comedy/drama of `With Honors,' to the action-packed `Mummy' films that have been so successful.  Overall, he's made a career out of taking chances and ferreting out parts that have quite effectively showcased his versatility and talent as an actor.  And it's easy to understand why this vehicle would've appealed to him.  On paper, at least, it probably looked like it would work; and Stu, as written, probably seemed like a character that would give him another opportunity to spread his wings and show some range.  Unfortunately, it's a long, long journey from script to screen, as they say.  And even an Oscar worthy performance in this case (and it wasn't) couldn't have saved the day.  The best that can be said is that Fraser did as well as anyone could have with the material he was given.	As for Bridget Fonda, one has to ask how an actor of her caliber gets caught up in such a thankless, generic role as this, which served the story as little more than fancy window dressing.  Fonda is simply too good and too deserving of better than to wind up in a part as forgettable as this.  But then again, it may have looked good on paper.  We'll call it that.	The supporting cast includes Chris Kattan (Organ Donor Stu), Giancarlo Esposito (Hypnos), Rose McGowan (Kitty), Dave Foley (Herb), Megan Mullally (Kimmy) and Lisa Zane (Medusa).  Sometimes it's fun to just relax and watch a movie that doesn't require much effort or thought and just lets you roll with the flow, but `Monkeybone' isn't one of them.  This is the one that never should have made it past the first draft of the screenplay, and Fraser and Fonda should invest in some white-out to try and expunge this from their respective filmographies.  There's magic in the movies, but not when the wires are exposed and you can see the trap door in the stage.  So file this one under `Sorry-- but try again,' and we can all move on to bigger, better and happier times.  I rate this one 1/10.

The film is somewhat bad in its storytelling ability, but the filmmaking and creative juices save this otherwise preposterous picture. Henry Selick, the genius behind similar movies like The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach, once again uses a variety of eye-popping, indulgent gimmickry to provide a delight for the senses. Model puppets, elaborate set designs, computer animation, stop-action photography, claymation, convincing and complex makeup, far out costumes and even some nifty voice effects preside the entertainment of Monkey Bone. Selick creates a world so full of energy and inventive characters that it justifies the movie's existence. 	Brendan Fraser makes another fool of himself as Stu Miley, a modest cartoonist who finally achieves success and does not know what to do with it. His long time girlfriend, Julie (Bridget Fonda), comforts, loves him and is ecstatic when Stu's cartoon primate creation, Monkeybone, a wisecracking and obscene libido portraiture, becomes a national television show. His manager wants to market the franchise big time, but Stu wants his simple life to stay simple with one major change he wants to marry Julie.	Before he has a chance to propose, a car accident leaves Stu in a coma and his spirit plunged into a weird, subconscious world called Downtown, a waiting place while a person is between life and death. The carnival-like realm inhabits a variety of unusual characters, like Kitty (Rose McGowan from Jawbreaker) an attractive waitress dressed in a feline furnish, Hypnos (Giancarlo Esposito) the half-man, half-goat ruler of Downtown, Death (Whoopi Goldberg) the cynical head honcho who determines the visitor's fate, and even the concoction of his own  imagination-the aggravating nuisance himself Monkeybone (voiced by John Turturro).	 Back on planet earth, Julie struggles to keep Stu's fanatic sister (Megan Mullally) from pulling his plug. Stu conceives a plan to escape Downtown by stealing an exit pass from none other than Death herself. He tries, gets the pass, but Monkeybone betrays his crafty creator and takes it for himself. Now inhabiting the body of Stu, Monkeybone is free to wreak havoc on Stu's lifestyle. While Stu himself possesses the body of a dead gymnast (Chris Kattan from House on Haunted Hill) to save what is left of his relationship with Julie. 	The scenes depicting Stu's nightmare reality are absolutely extraordinary. The artful sets, special effects, costumes, animation, and makeup are some of the most intricate and tasty examples of effective eye-candy.  It's like we've entered an imaginative dreamscape of zany and entertaining characters. Everyone involved feels alive and inexhaustible, especially Brendan Fraser in a very effective performance. Monkeybone himself is quite annoying-but in a fun kind of way. The involving and fresh atmosphere make this world a memorable movie experience. 	There are several hilarious sequences, one involving a dog's nightmare where several of his feline nemeses secure him and prepare to detach his manhood, and another when a walking organ donor loses his guts during a fight sequence. By now you are probably realizing, despite the cartoon qualities, this movie is not intended for small children. Monkeybone contains all sorts of sexual innuendoes, horrific concepts, and suggestive situations. During the screening I attended, a woman instructed her three young children to leave the theater. However, the movie is clearly too goofy and comical for serious, mature audiences-so what is the target audience?	 Monkeybone provides enough positives to outweigh the negatives. The production is worth a watch to experience some of the dazzling images-but I would not see it again for free.

A screwball final act with a corpse running around and a group of surgeons running after his organs is just an embarrassment of bad writing and Selick not in any sort of control of this film.

Apparently the filmmakers decided they needed to hit their viewers over the head with even the most elementary-school-level butt jokes.The stop-motion animation is competent, but the direction of the human actors is constantly stilted and flat. I guess it's intended to be cartoonish but instead it comes across as amateurish and pandering, as if Selick and co. assumed audiences wouldn't recognize comedy unless everyone in the movie acted like spastic, one-dimensional clowns. There is no attempt to make any character relatable or likable; even the mild-mannered nice guy protagonist is a wormy, self-pitying loser from the get-go.Lastly, the film is painfully sexist as well, with constant portrayal of woman as sex objects in a pathetic effort to add some adult appeal. Again, the film can't attract viewers with anything clever, original or meaningful but instead uses the most pandering and insulting methods possible. Only watch this mess if you're terribly easily-amused or possibly if you haven't aged 15 yet.

Both colourful characters want to escape to the real world, both cannot decide to entertain young ones or adults, and both are very boring indeed.This has the edge on the other though, Fraser is likable, and Fonda is as good as ever. The main problems are when we are in the other world, it appears that Selick has taken Burtons Beetlejuice world and made it boring an unimaginative.And this is the other problem, there is no imagination, and the effects are terrible for such a big movie.

Movies like Plan 9 From Outer Space and The Beast From Yucca Flats are often mentioned because of their overall low quality. Once I sat down and watch them however, I either saw them as unintentionally funny, surprisingly earnest or otherwise undeserving of such an abysmal reputation. Monkeybone on the other-hand remains one of only a handful of movies that has left me simultaneously awestruck and angry; stupefied and seething. A cringe and groan inducing mess that is certainly my official pick for worst movie ever made.Brendan Fraser stars as a successful cartoonist who falls into a coma after an accident, the details of which are too stupid to mention, and ends up in a parallel universe inside his mind where he meets his creation Monkeybone (voiced by John Turturro). Monkeybone, a lascivious little monkey with a penchant for chaos takes over his body and wreaks havoc on his relationship with his girlfriend/psychiatrist. Fraser (still in his own head we think), makes a plea to Death, played by Whoopi Goldberg and is loaned a body to win back his girl before Monkeybone gets his dirty ape hands on her.Co-stars Bridget Fonda, Megan Mullally, Dave Foley, Rose McGowan and Chris Kattan round-up an unremarkable list of talent that were hired to stand behind stop-motion models and in front of rejected Beetlejuice sets. The dark atmosphere of the movie struggles to integrate its scatological humor, most of which is provided by an obnoxious cartoon monkey. Its obvious the film was edited into oblivion in post-production which would account for the lion's share of the plot holes but my question is to what end? Sure it made the movie shorter (thank god!) but the plot still took two acts to actually get moving. Once it did it sprightly rushed into the last 15 minutes like a morbid Tom and Jerry cartoon.What was the prime demographic for this movie? I think the David Lynch crowd is a bit beyond poop jokes at this point and its far too dark for children. Arguably the saddest thing about this film however is the lost potential in director Henry Selick, whose previous work includes Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach. While Selick has since redeemed himself with 2009's Coraline, Monkeybone presents the director at his nadir.Monkeybone truly bats and misses on all points. Its An ugly looking hatchback with no engine, a busy yet boring quagmire. At its very best its a slap-dashed movie that is literally all dressed up with no where to go. It showcases bad direction, bad acting, bad editing, bad cinematography, bad script, bad story. I honestly would be ashamed to be this film's boom mic operator (which is visible in one scene). The failure of this film is actually quite spectacular when you think about it. Watch it if you're masochistic, otherwise stay far away from Monkeybone!http//theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Selick sells himself short","Date":"26 December 2010","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" Henry Selick is a very talented man. He proved this talent when he directed A Nightmare Before Christmas (It's a shame so many fans of that movie just assume Tim Burton directed it and ignore Selick's achievement.) and made great use of his team of talented animators to bring Burton's original idea to life. Selick once again proved himself a good director with the stunted but visually stunning (And still somewhat enjoyable) adaptation of James & The Giant Peach. Recently, Selick did yet another fantastic piece of cinema with Coraline; but in-between James & The Giant Peach and Coraline... there was Monkeybone.Something tells me Selick regrets this one. Monkeybone is a film in which Selick sells himself short. His talents are on display in several portions of the film, and yet some portions are clumsily directed. Yet even if the whole film had been as visually impressive as his other works and as tightly directed, the movie would still fail with the script it is given. I have not read the graphic novel Dark Town, so maybe I should cut the script-writers some slack and blame whoever wrote Dark Town for inspiring this lazy, immature, and often annoying script.The film follows animator Stu Miley, creator of a popular animated show called Monkeybone, about a mischievous and perverted monkey that lives inside a timid students backpack. Stu gets in a car accident, and is sent into a coma. He soon finds himself in an abstract and insane underworld where he meets Monkeybone, who promptly sets out to drive Stu (and the viewers) insane. Stu wants to return home, but is duped by a devil in pajamas named Hypno - who instead, sends Monkeybone into Stu's body.The problem with Monkeybone is that the humor if you will, is immature and insulting. We are shown a Monkeybone cartoon early on, and it is cringe worthy. It baffles me how some people in the movie claim that the show is a children's cartoon as it is wildly inappropriate; and more-over, I don't know how any adult could laugh at such juvenile material. The cartoon focuses on how the Student is sexually attracted to his old teachers huge, sagging flaps of arm fat. He gets an erection, and Monkeybone (Who more or less is an anthropomorphic erection. Goody.) pops out and starts harassing the teacher while the student is humiliated for his quite visible erection. Funny? No? Well, get used to that kind of humor and trust me, it gets worse unless you REALLY like fart jokes.It is a shame that so much talent has to be wasted here. Brendan Fraser is actually fairly likable as Stu Miley (However when Monkeybone takes over his body, he becomes annoying and only makes Monkeybone's character more annoying as well.) and Selick has once again brought on board tons of playful and creative visuals. Monkeybone is animated quite well using stop-motion, and arguably the best part of the whole picture is the underworld and its abstract, bizarre, and downright weird denizens. There are even a few jokes that work through these weird visuals, like the Grim-Reapers mode of transportation being a little tricycle or how the gate leading back to the real world is known as The Great Emancipator and fittingly, the exit appears as a giant Abraham Lincoln head. There is also a genuinely disturbing (Yet memorable) scene in which Stu is forced into one of the nightmares that he himself painted years ago, where Selick shows off yet another fantastic visual effect that only makes me wish the films script was redeemable.However, when the film takes place in our world - it is clumsily directed and is made twice as painful to sit through due to the lack of any creative visuals. Monkeybone was already annoying in the underworld, but when he takes Stu's body - actor Brendan Fraser goes from likable to cringe worthy. The on-going shtick is that Monkeybone is still an animal, and acts like one and is hyper-active, perverted, and crude. One of the most insultingly idiotic scenes is when Monkeybone gets turned on by watching animals mate on The Discover Channel, and then we are forced to a 5 minute scene of him doing a bizarre sexual display in nothing but his underpants hooting like a monkey and doing a mix of dancing and animalistic moves. Barf. Oh, and did I mention he wants to give everyone nightmares by giving out monkey bone toys that fart nightmare gas? Yeah.All in all this is bad - really, really bad. I would have given it a rating of 2 if it had not been for the fantastic visuals in the underworld, and one genuinely funny scene where Stu is in prison in the underworld and runs into the likes of Stephen King and Genghis Khan. That means this gets a 4. It's a shame because you can catch glimpses of Selick's talents, but the script is just too clumsy, offensive, and rude to be enjoyable.

He isn't ready for the commercialisation of his character though and slips away from the screening of his pilot with his girlfriend. Ironically, a car load of merchandise sees him have a car accident that lands him into a coma. While his girlfriend sits by his bedside worrying, Stu is thrown into a nightmare world where only his own creation seems interested in helping get the exit pass necessary to escape. However when push comes to shove, it is Monkeybone that escapes back into the real world to put his evil plot into action.For the first thirty minutes or so of this film I was wondering why it didn't have better ratings on this site because I actually found it very enjoyable. The reason for this was the sheer imagination and weird creativity of the cartoon world was keeping me engaging. However once Monkeybone's betrayal has happened the action moves more and more into the real world. While doing this it does try to retain the same wacky sense of imagination but somehow, out of context, it doesn't work that well and instead of being funny it is rather silly. It doesn't help that at this point the film also starts to work on a plot of sorts and that again takes away more than it adds.The cast are very mixed despite being so starry. Fraser is best in his Stu role but struggles with his Monkeybone personae; he tries hard and gives it his all but again it is all a bit silly. Fonda has a thankless supporting role that sees her having to carry the plot. Turturro was a good choice of voice for Monkeybone but not enough is made of his character. The rest of the cast features mostly amusing turns from Kattan, Goldberg, Foley, Esposito and others, mostly benefiting from the minor comic turns they are asked to perform outside of the main plot.Overall then a very inconsistent film. In the coma it is imaginative and fascinating to watch but, outside of these scenes it relies on comedy and plot to get by and sadly has neither in sufficient quantity to make for a complete film.

As a comedy, it only works to a certain extent--there are a couple of laughs, but that's it, really. However, as an effect-laden film, it works beautifully. The special effects are amazing--The surreal images, the stop-motion animation, the various creatures featured in downtown,and the production design are all simply incredible, creative, different.... The film is mostly a showcase for these effects, and they definitely made it a more enjoyable experience. Director Henry Selick has several other bizarre flick on him resume as well, including the excellent Nightmare before Christmas and james and the giant peach. Selick clearly doesn't make people flicks--this is especially obvious by the awkwardness of the scenes featuring actors and large amounts of dialouge.

You have, Downtown, the pre-death nightmare land filled with goofy creatures coming out of his dreams, and then the live-action world of real life that he first comes into as Monkeybone in his own body and then later as himself in a practically dead corpse of a prior gymnast's body played by Chris Katten. The funniest parts are with Kattan's character in which he's perfectly cast for this role with his physical humor perfected on Saturday Night Live, but he's just a small portion of the movie.

His sister apparently made a pact that if either of them was to be on life support then the plug would be pulled. His girlfriend discovers that he is in nightmare land and needs nightmare juice to scare him awake. The reality of being cast in a film this shitty should be enough to scare anybody awake. This nightmare world is beautifully detailed with odd creatures but Fraser must get past to reality. Unfortunately Monkey Bone also gets past and possesses his body. Director Henry Selick was more successful creating James and the Giant Peach but here he loses control. Fraser handles the cartoon posturing effectively but the whole nightmare land element needs better explaining than what we are given. Bridget Fonda as his girlfriend is flat. Whoopi Goldberg is horrible as the nightmare judge. Chris Kattan is featured with a distorted body. Rose McGowan plays a character named Miss Kitty, which sounds too kinky for this mess.

Brendan Fraser plays at least two characters in this film, with his body inhabited by his alter-ego, Monkeybone, at one point.  His primary self is shy and unconventional; Monkeybone in the main character's body is wild, sexually compulsive, and at one point, a rock performer.  He is such a super stud; he is the only young star who looks good to me, despite my advanced age, and my memories of better  generations of movies and stars.

It sounds like a good idea at the time but it soon gets far out of hand when Stu is sabotaged while driving by an inflatable Monkeybone and falls deep into a coma. While in his coma, he is transported to DownTown, a big carnival freakshow purgatory limbo where ordinary people wait with monsters to die or be summoned awake from their coma by a Grim Reaper. Stu waits patiently for three months to awaken but when his sister Kimmy orders the doctors to pull the plug, he is forced to infiltrate Death's Lair and nab himself a much coveted EXIT-pass, which will guarantee his body consciousness regardless of how the pass is acquired. He gets the pass with the help of Monkeybone, who then hijacks the pass and Stu's body. While Monkeybone now lives as Stu, the real Stu rots in the jail of his coma. He must somehow get another pass out of DownTown and fast, before Monkeybone and his employer can mass produce their own nightmare-inducing line of Monkeybone merchandise, and so he can formally propose marriage to Julie.This film is very rich in visuals. Lots of live and stop animation, costumes and make-up, computer generated special effects, and it all looks great. But it's far too crude in it's presentation to be of much entertainment. And in fact, it's not entertaining at all. It's barely any tamer than COOL WORLD dealing with perversion and overt sexuality. The whole movie is actually like an animated family softcore porn comedy with a zombie running around, spilling his vital organs out over the landscape for a team of greedy surgeons to collect.

Monkeybone is a perfect example for movie studios to re-examine standards for stamping their approval on films with no story, character development and extremely bad writing.Monkeybone revolves around the life of Stu Miley, a cartoonist who has created a comic strip featuring Monkeybone, who has become a nuesence for Stu. With a beautiful girlfriend at his side and a successful comic strip becoming a national television show, fate steps in to take it away from him. Monkeybone escapes from the underworld where death holds court. With places like 'The Coma Bar,' I was laughing because it was ironic because I almost fell into a coma watching this movie. After Stu finds out Monkeybone escapes and takes over his body on earth, he pleads his case to Death herself, Goldberg, to take Monkeybone back to the underworld.Monkeybone lost all of its credibility and rights to be called a comedy because there are nothing but scenes slapped together to fill time. I lost respect for this film when it became clear the cast and crew were relying on stupid comedy for its success. The best example of this occurred with the appearance of comedian Chris Kattan as a recently dead gymnast whose body is taken over by Stu. My thoughts were how could the director cast someone like this; but then I remembered it was a stupid movie to begin with.I have always enjoyed watching Fraser because he has built a body of work. Fraser is a tremendous asset to Hollywood, but nobody would know it from his role in Monkeybone. With outstanding roles in Gods and Monsters, Blast From The Past and The Mummy, Fraser has proven he is one of the most gifted and talented young actors whose roles rival other actors such as Ben Affleck and Matt Damon; furthermore, fans would not know it with his role in Monkeybone. I have always stated that every actor is entitled to have an off movie because there have been so many good actors in bad films and they have come back stronger than ever. I hope Monkeybone is last bad film from Fraser for awhile.Fonda is one of the most talented actresses I have had the pleasure to watch on screen because she adds so much to each film she takes part in. From beauty and charm to screen presence, Fonda has created a repetoire of talents to utilize in comedies or dramas; however, she fails to convince me that her performance was great.Monkeybone is an insult to fans, actors and directors alike because it is one of the worst movies ever made and should have been left on the cutting room floor.

Like a Ralph Bakshi nightmare without the hardcore animal sex, Selick's film is strange, surreal, slightly disturbing, and, at certain intervals, fine and clever fun.Stu Miley (Brendan Fraser) is an example of the healing power of art, having battled back from depression and almost paralyzing nightmares by channelling his horrors into an anarchic cartoon alter ego named Monkeybone, who wreaks havoc through the pages of an underground comic book.  Stu's comic is now being turned into a cartoon series for TV, complete with a raft of merchandising, but he's still not happy, and it gets worse when he is in a violent car accident and gets transported to Downtown, a bizarre limbo world between earth and what lies beyond.  Here, Monkeybone is real, a devilish prankster nightclub emcee, and when he finds out that there's a way back to the real world, he does some con work to get out into Stu's body and wreak some earthly havoc.  It's now up to Stu's soul, trapped Downtown, to get out and reclaim his body before Monkeybone turns the world into an army of out-of-control id-monsters like himself.As you can probably already tell, this film is not your standard cookie-cutter Hollywood product.  The plot alone is bizarre enough to warrant a look, but for fans of monster makeup, special effects, and art direction, Monkeybone will qualify as a must-see.  Selick cut his directorial chops on The Nightmare Before Christmas, and here, the world he creates is like a live-action mutation of that same bizarre stop-motion boneyard.  Freakish creatures crowd the boardwalks of Downtown, scythe-wielding reapers swoop the skies on gray-shrouded motorcycles, and the way back to earth is a circus strength-testing machine that shoots souls up through the gaping mouth of a floating Abraham Lincoln coin bank.  Animation rubs shoulders with live action (the Monkeybone character himself is a computer graphic, voiced by John Turturro), and virtually every shot contains something bizarre and new to marvel over.  If nothing else, Monkeybone is further proof that special effects technicians today can do just about anything.Unfortunately, the story is such that we find ourselves hard-pressed to care about what's going on.  Stu is a lumpy sad sack before his accident; he's much more fun when Monkeybone takes over, leering in a bad goatee and shaking his booty at his confused girlfriend (Bridget Fonda).  The plot to run riot over the world is dashed off more or less as an afterthought, and there's just not enough juice here in terms of the characters to really pull us into their dilemma.  What's worse, as amazing as Downtown and its denizens are to see, nothing really happens there.  It's almost like a big celluloid tattoo; fun to look at, but with nothing really behind it at all.The actors do what they can to redeem the material.  Fraser ceaselessly amazes me with his guileless bravery.  This is a man utterly unafraid to look silly, stupid, or flat-out weird, and Monkeybone tests these abilities to the breaking point.  His performance here is not as inspired as his work in last year's Bedazzled, which gave him seven characters to play, but he has fun, especially with the frantic final act, when Monkeybone has taken over Stu's body.  Dave Foley gives some prissy snap to his role as Stu's agent, and Rose McGowan proves that, even in whiskers as a cat-faced Downtown barmaid, she's still one of the sexiest women in movies.  The surprise here, however, is Chris Kattan, who plays a recently deceased gymnast reanimated when Stu's soul needs a host body to battle with Monkeybone.  Picture a corpse jolted back to life with entirely too intense electricity, and that's the effect of Kattan's riotous physical comedy here.  Not to mention the fact that he's being chased by doctors, eager for the donor organs that keep plopping out of the autopsy slit in his stomach.Overall, I would say Monkeybone is an interesting failure.  It offers a lot of great visual moments, and is worth seeing once for Fraser and Kattan, but it's one of those experiences that leaves you feeling undernourished at the end.  There's nothing to hold onto, nothing to take away from the experience.  Still, even though the result is no masterpiece, I have to admire the efforts of Selick and Co.  Their biggest mistake?  They should have thought smaller.  It's not a great film, but Monkeybone, I think, would have made one hell of an album cover.

Iparticularly liked the theme of voyage into and return from the land ofdeath, because this sets up sort of a classical framework, and gave themovie a good level of restraint and balance.    	As for the visual effects, which I feel have been the mainmarketing appeal of the film so far, they are consistently done, whichflaws the film.  The effects in the land of sleep are extremely welldone.  What might otherwise be a meaningless clutter of eye candy workshere because it adds to the sense of unreality and disorientation.  Inthe world of sleep the well done eye candy enhances the film on morethan a purely visual level.  The problem is that the eye candy, andconstant activity are carried over to scenes in the real world.  Thisdecreases some of the effect of having different worlds in the firstplace.  If people in the real world don't obey all the laws of physics,dress in matching colors, or act rationally then what exactly isdisorienting about the sleep world in the first place?    	In summary the dream and death world sequences were very well andappropriately done, and had the whole movie been as well done I woulddefinitely recommend it.  However carrying the visual clutter, that'sclutter - not richness, into the real normal world degenerated the movieinto more of a decorative eye candy type work.

Monkeybone stars Brendan Fraser and Bridget Fonda, two very likeable and talented actors, and features impressive sets and costumes.So what happened?Well, there's the story  Cartoonist Stu Miley (Fraser) is on top of the world.  His wildly successful comic strip, Monkeybone, has just been optioned for television, and merchandisers are beating a path to his door. To top it off, he's going to propose to his beautiful girlfriend, Dr. Julie McElroy (Fonda), who successfully treated him for recurring nightmares. Sadly, thanks to a freak accident, Stu is rendered comatose before he can propose.  Thanks to one of the worst plot devices I have ever heard, Stu's sister Kimmy (the unbelievably annoying Megan Mullally) has given Stu only three months to live before the machines that keep him alive are turned off.Stu finds himself in Downtown, a weird pop-art representation of his unconscious that looks like a Robert Williams canvas--if Williams had dropped some mescaline before painting it.  It's here that Stu first meets Monkeybone (voice of John Turturro) in the flesh, as it were.  Downtown is rendered beautifully, with bright, eye-popping colors and nightmarish denizens; I wish the movie could have sustained its brilliance and edginess. Thanks to some chicanery by Hypnos, the God of Sleep, Monkeybone gets sent back to inhabit Stu's body. Stu then has to scramble to stop Monkeybone before he ruins Stu's life.  Hilarity presumably ensues.And that's where the problem lies  the movie doesn't really do much of anything once it leaves Downtown.  Yeah, the pace is frenetic, but it's filled with predictable shenanigans that you could see coming a mile away. This wouldn't matter so much if it were funny.  Which it isn't. (And I have to voice a personal rant here  What is with the slavish devotion to fart and butt jokes?  Good God, you'd think nobody had ever done them before. Does every  freakin' movie have to have them?  Fart jokes haven't been funny since the campfire scene in Blazing Saddles.)The plot reminded me a lot of Ralph Bakshi's flop Cool World, in which a cartoonist finds himself trapped in his own creation, then has to get back to the Real World to prevent calamity.  Unfortunately, it also suffers from Cool World 's flaws  the dream/cartoon world is a lot more interesting than the real.  And the characters tend to be just cardboard cutouts, which really saddened me, because the characters in Selick's previous films were vivid and sharply drawn.  Not so in Monkeybone.  Worst of the lot is the amazingly whiny Kimmy.  I was hoping someone would just tell her to shut the ^%#*& up.And so, to sum up this too-long review  Monkeybone has too much to do and not enough to do it with, despite the winning presence of Brendan Fraser. Too bad--it could really have been something.

(Except EW which gave it a B+.) But don't get your hopes up too high...Monkeybone still fails on a lot of levels. First of all, it's NOT very funny. That's OK, because it's not really a comedy. It's more of a horror/fantasy than anything else. And because they decided to market this towards kids (big mistake), the horror isn't as horrific as it could have been. There's some really creepy scenes here, but they all stop short of their possiblities. And it's obvious that a lot of plot has been edited out to speed things up. Sometimes dialog scenes cut short while the dialog continues on, being drowned out by an action sequence. It's very hard to follow.But if you go in expecting to see a experiemental, surreal flick (this is going to be big on video with the drug crowd), you'll find a lot to like. The portal from purgatory to earth is through Abe Lincoln's mouth! (With no explanation!) The grim reaper is a bureaucrat!

However, Monkey Bone seemed like it was cut off at the knees in terms of the lengths taken to make this fantasy world come alive.I was greatly reminded of the alternative art magazine Juxtapoz, which I'm sure  was a great influence in the making of Monkey Bone, but it seems that the movie was not yet completed when the studio decided to release it to theaters. Where certain scenes cast an indelible picture to the audience,other parts of the film seemed like they were created overnight and written by an eight-year-old. In the place of more scenes of outrageous fantasy are very stupid and pointless comedy bits that go no where. This film is a textbook example of the butchering of films by Hollywood studios.It's still worth a rental, as it was not a total disappointment.

Or Good Humor","Date":"7 August 2010","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" Monkeybone should be taught in film school as an example of how many smart, talented people can come together to make a movie that is a complete mess. I expected this to be a wacky, weird film when first seeing it. However, all the jokes fall flat because the premise is underdeveloped, most of the characters (most especially the title character) are half-baked, and the story is full of plot holes and developments that merit further explanation.Brendan Fraser plays Stu Miley, a cartoonist who creates an adult cartoon show called Monkeybone. In the beginning of the film, you see part of an episode that is well-animated (probably using Flash) about a manic monkey who pops out of nowhere and causes mischief. The reason this cartoon differentiates from other manic cartoon characters like Roger Rabbit or Woody Woodpecker is because he appears when the boy in the cartoon has an erection. Long story.It is with this cartoon that you get a sampling for what Monkeybone is like, but it's not enough to tell you what makes him so unique and appealing compared to other cartoon characters. More on that later. It is soon determined that the series has been picked up by a Comedy Central-like cable network (referred to as The Comedy Channel in this movie. Comedy Central could have put their brand on this movie, but it's a good thing they decided not to).Although Stu doesn't initially like the merchandising that takes place for his cartoon creation, he still takes some samples home with him. However, he gets into a car accident after complications with a giant Monkeybone balloon blowing up in his car. Again, long story.This car crash knocks him unconscious, even though we don't see him get knocked out by the crash. Although the wound mark on his head doesn't look serious, he slips into a coma, and into another world that seems to be a combination of Cool World (1992) and Beetlejuice (1988). This world is filled with strange creatures, some human and some animal. Sooner or later, he runs into a CGI-animated version of his creation, voiced by John Turturro.As soon as Stu falls into this world, the movie gets really confusing. It is not determined or said what this world is and why it is the way it is. Is it Stu's subconscious, or another dimension altogether? Obviously he came up with Monkeybone, but did he create the other characters in his mind, like the Egypsian cat lady waitress (Rose McGowan)? None of this is ever answered or explained by anyone in the movie. Brendan Fraser, who is normally a good actor, doesn't seem to wonder about this world he's in long enough. He may have been wondering during the film how his agent had convinced him to sign onto such a fractured movie.Regardless, in the conscious world, his girlfriend (Bridget Fonda) tries to get him out of a coma, while his sister (Megan Mullally) seems all too eager to pull the plug on him. There is nothing funny about Mullally in her role. It's never established exactly why she wants her brother off of life support. She doesn't seem to hate her brother, nor does she ever mention her share of Monkeybone royalties. Such subplots could have made for interesting conflict, but because neither of these things are explained, we just have a sad case of a woman who, despite being very funny on Will and Grace, has made bad decisions in regards to movie roles.Back in the subconscious cluster-flub of a world, Stu must get an Exit Pass from Death (Whoopi Goldberg) in order to regain consciousness. His annoying monkey alter ego works with him to cheat death, then ends up taking the pass himself and taking over Stu's conscious mind when he awakens from a coma. What results is Brendan Fraser acting like a monkey, only he's really bad at it. It would have been funny if the filmmakers dubbed Turturro's high-pitched voice into Fraser's speech. Also, Fraser seems to forget he's a monkey most of the time, only occasionally swinging on limbs and doing other acrobatic tricks associated with the main character.The big thing that makes Fraser unfunny from being taken over by his cartoon counterpart is the fact that we still really don't know that monkey. What are his motivations? What can't he live without? Why is his mission to give people bad dreams (another subplot brought about, but not fully explained), and what does he gain from this mission being accomplished? We don't get any of that. Instead, Fraser has a cringe-worthy scene where he, possessed by Monkeybone, publicly proposes to Fonda and then sings Brick House. Again, why? Explain, movie, EXPLAIN!!!I like Brendan Fraser a lot, which is why it kills me that this movie was so bad. What's even more disappointing is that the film is directed by Henry Selick, director of The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993) and Coraline (2009). Those movies told great stories, and the stop motion animation was flawless. Mostly, though, the movies would not have worked without a coherent story line.My guess is that this film suffered from what's known as Groupthink. Groupthink is when a group of intelligent people get together and collectively make a bad decision, resulting from one or more people being too afraid to speak up and say the decision is bad, or convincing themselves the decision is good. It is what is believed to have caused the Bay of Pigs fiasco in the early '60's, and the tragic Challenger shuttle launch in 1986. Clearly, intelligent, talented filmmakers worked on this film. Unfortunately, someone should have spoken up and said what a mess they were creating.

But if he doesn't deal with it soon, Stu will be celebrating this way forever. Stu Miley's life couldn't get any better. He has a beautiful, trusting girlfriend, Julie, whom he is going to propose to, and his popular comic strip, Monkeybone, is about to become a nationally syndicated television series. When a freak accident puts him in a coma, however, Stu's world is turned upside down as he becomes trapped in Downtown, an outrageous city of his own creation. Immediately time starts running out for Stu as he must evade Death and make it back to the world of reality before his sister pulls the plug on him, leaving him trapped in the streets of Downtown forever. To further complicate matters for Stu, his comic book creation Monkybone becomes a reality that wants to stay in reality. Stu's only hope of escape lies in the hands of a cat woman named Miss Kitty who has her own reasons for wanting Stu to stay in Downtown.  The not so talented Brendan Fraser stars as cartoon strip writer Stu Miley in the very imaginative adaptation of Kaja Blackley's comic, Dark Town. Supporting Fraser are actual Hollywood talents including Kiss of the Dragon's Bridget Fonda, as Miley's beautiful and soft spoken girlfriend, Julie; A Night at the Roxbury star Chris Kattan assumes the unusual role of the deceased and continually disemboweling athlete, Organ Donor Stu; John Turturro, sounding somewhat like his brother Nick Turturro, lends his talents as the voice for the hell raising cartoon character Monkeybone. As well, Ready to Rumble's sexy star Rose McGowan, Kids in the Hall alumni Dave Foley, and Whoppi Goldberg are just some of the other notable names to mention in a film boasting a great cast, Brendan Fraser excluded. Director Henry Selick uses the same fresh and imaginative style he used in The Nightmare Before Christmas to make this film very pleasing on the eyes, however its immature humor is not so pleasing on the head. Trying to cop cheap feels doesn't make me laugh the way it used to. Don't get me wrong though, I still don't mind some crude sexual humor, such as in American Pie, but that was because the jokes in that film required delivery and actual humor, and not just a character with an innuendo for a name. I must admit though, some scenes involving Chris Kattan near the film's end are disturbingly humorous. Writer Sam Hamm does a good job in helping to keep the story imaginative, but the film's producers, Mark Radcliffe and Michael Barnathan, didn't seem to be as helpful, due to the fact that some of the scenes had seemingly cheap set design, such is the case with Fraser's roller coaster ride. However, they did seem to put some good money into wardrobe, as the costumes and make-up, especially McGowan's, are well done and fit the film's imagination.  Monkeybone is by no means a classic, and it does happen to star Brendan Fraser, but the great supporting players, the bold and imaginative look, and a genuinely unpredictable ending, make this film, in my opinion, something better than your average Blockbuster rental. So if your feeling a little bored and need some entertainment, just grab Monkeybone.Overall Rating 7 out of 10 "}{"Title":"See it once, then forget about it","Date":"20 July 2003","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  I was dying to see this movie, because at the time I had a bit of a crush on Brendan Fraser, but I couldn't have been more disappointed.It wasn't funny at all, I don't recall laughing at any time.

But it is really Monkeybone's personality in Stu's body, while Stu' personality remains in the purgatory, trying to figure a way to get out. Meanwhile Stu/Monkeybone goes back to his old world, acting for the most part very strangely.In a somewhat complex series of events, the real Stu gets booted back to consciousness in the body of a dead gymnast, eventually suppresses Monkeybone, and the real Stu and his body are reunited. He is happy, his girlfriend is happy. The film is very clever, the picture and sound on the DVD are fine. Where does the character Monkeybone come from? As a child, Stu had a boner in class, the teacher noticed, embarrassed Stu called it Monkeybone and in the process created this fictional over-sexed character which he carried with him into adulthood.

In its released version--which seems to be about sixteen minuteslong--tons of stuff has been inexplicably thrown out in a fire-salefrenzy by Fox's cutters. Brendan Fraser is a cartoonist who goesinto a coma and sees his star creation--a horny imp namedMonkeybone--ascend into the real world and take over his life.Fraser, trapped in the Land of Nightmares while his bodyvegetates on earth, is at one point thrown into a dungeon with Attilathe Hun, Edgar Allan Poe, and Stephen King.

Clearly, somehigh-ranking poobah at NewsCorp gave the order Chop it downso it can play seven times a day and get it out there.

Selick has a gift forimages, and his nightmarescape is agreeably filled with actors ingoofy rubber-headed costumes, and Expressionistic sets thatare like a theme restaurant based on BEETLEJUICE. This may bea movie that was DOA during the development process Selick hasthe kind of high-flying visual imagination that should be set free,not clouded with childish, rudimentary plotting and panderingpoo-poo gags...which is how this one turned out.Rose McGowan is dreamy as a bad girl of the underworld who's asort of Playboy Bunny kitty-cat--when she makes eyes at Fraser,we hear deep, bass purring sounds on the track. And BridgetFonda, given some of the dumbest things to do and say in modernmovies, is luminous--sigh-making. The lead seems to have beenwritten for Jim Carrey. And when Fraser's character is possessedby the spirit of Monkeybone (who's voiced by John Turturro)...well,seeing Brendan Fraser doing John Turturro doing a monkey is notpretty. MONKEYBONE is full of a hundred cool little doodles.

The supporting roles included Dave Foley as Herb, Megan Mullally as Stu's sister, Chris Kattan as Stu's body, and Whoopi Goldberg as Death. I really thought that the best role was played by Dave Foley. He was in the film more frequently than you would expect him to be, and he adds a certain comfortable feeling to the film. His character is witty, and helps to make the movie what it is. Mr. Foley and Mr. Fraser have worked together before (Kids in the Hall Brain Candy, Blast From the Past) and the results are always hilarious. Megan Mullally and Whoopi Goldberg have rather small roles. Perhaps too small, considering what good actresses they are. Chris Kattan had a take it or leave it part. He basically just did a lot of fancy stunts and tricks. Even though the movie is based on a cartoon character, Monkeybone, this is not a movie for children. There is a lot of crude or potty humor in the film, and there is also a scene in which Herb (Dave Foley) runs naked through a crowded museum.

So how could MONKEYBONE go wrong? All together now, no Tim Burton. Both creators provided what could be called `Tim Burton lite'; they did their best to mimic Burton but were not able to capture his delightfully dark and twisted camp. The result in MONKEYBONE is a waste. Yes, when the animation appeared, mostly with the Monekybone figure, it was cool and the marrying of animation with live-action was nicely done, but it was nothing that hasn't been seen since WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?, which was released in 1988(!). I found similar faults with Selick's sophomore film, JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH. Please, Henry, just stick to animation.

The entire plot boils down to an undead monkey taking his creators body just so he can give people nightmare with evil farts.

If you want something with a lick of intelligence, you might want to look somewhere else.The direction is great and I admit, I like Brendan Fraiser as the star, but it just cant be saved by good production values. The disjointed plot and lame jokes (With a few far and between exceptions, like when Stu is in prison in the Underworld and meets up with a few famous figures, including Stephen King who had a run in with Cujo.

The basic premise of Monkeybone, the story of a cartoonist and his id suspended in a fantasy world akin to Bettlejuice's Neitherworld, has legs, no doubt about it. But the writing for this movie was just plain wooden. Brendan Fraser is decent as mild-mannered Stu, a budding cartoonist with high hopes for his pet project, the Monkeybone cartoon. He's just (to quote Whoopi Goldberg's Death character) too vanilla as Stu, a trait that marks his girlfriend, played by Bridget Fonda, in this movie. As Stu-possessed-by-Monkeybone, he does his best to act goofy and strange, but it doesn't strike me as particularly inspired acting. The most interesting characters are those that inhabit The Afterlife. The actor who plays the ruler of the Dream World, Hypnos, is very good as a conniving villain. Whoopi Goldberg is a bit flat as Death, Hypnos's sister, but is not terrible either. Rose McGowan looks as lovely as ever as Kitty, the half-human, half-cat denizen of Downtown who tries to help Stu escape from the Afterlife. She's not very potent in her role, but still manages to hold her own.I enjoyed the idea the screenwriters had in mind, and enjoyed the costumes and sets for The Afterlife. The filmmakers create a very credible fantasy world that is very fun to watch. The writing and acting are what drag this movie down. The actors are simply to bland and uninteresting, and are exactly the opposite of the flashy and exciting sets. I still recommend Monkeybone, but don't expect much more than a bland movie.

Monkeybone reminded me stylistically of Beetlejuice, with normal characters intruding on a surreal and supernatural world. Unlike Beetlejuice, Monkeybone isn't given enough time to develop one scene before catapaulting off to the next. We barely get to see Stu before he gets put in a coma. Suddenly it turns out his girlfriend works with sleep disorders. Stu's time in Downtown seems a little rushed in cramming as much weirdness into as short a time as possible. The film only really starting to reach its funny moments with the arrival of Stu's id (Monkeybone) into the real world. Then Stu is sent back as a dead man... it doesn't make a lot of sense. It wouldn't need to, if the film kept the audience distracted through its comedy. But it doesn't. Too many concepts are shoved into too short a time. Brendan Fraser as Stu does his typically great work (especially with some of the physical comedy) but...

First off, it's supposed to be slapstick comedy. If you're not intophysical comedy, you won't get this movie. But if you are, you canappreciate Brendan Fraser's simultaneously subtle and over thetop physical performance.Secondly, it's a wicked visual parody of the dream sequencepsychobabble scene run amok. The scenes of 'Downtown' are sortof a live-action Hieronymous Bosch painting, but done for comedy.There's a lot of quoting of surrealist paintings, including anhomage to the Dali sequence in 'Spellbound'. There's all sorts ofvisual humour on top of the schtick. The idea of having the Id, theEgo, and the Superego all come to life and duke it out to see which'soul' gets to inhabit the body is far more sophisticated than the fartjokes, but Monkeybone doesn't err in taking itself too seriously onthat count. It is kind of fun to see how the relationship between themain character and his girflfriend changes with different aspects ofhis persona 'in the body'; a cute commentary on the rules ofattraction and commitment.The movie of course isn't quite as great as it could've been bysticking to a purely black comedy motif -- the plot is still boy hasgirl, boy loses girl, boy tries to get girl back, all while saving theworld from the evil plot of the dark forces attempting to populatethe world with more nightmares -- but hey, we can't get everything.Of special note is the sequence where Chris Kattan plays BrendanFraser inhabiting the body of a dead gymnast, relentlesslypursued by a team of doctors intent on recovering his organs -- agreat physical performance (Kattan is believably the SuperEgoBrendan Fraser) that's also a funny reversal of the usual zombieflick (the live doctors pursuing the horrified corpse to try to harvesthis flesh!)

The movie starts out on a pretty flimsy premise, but once Brendan Fraser goes into a coma the plot becomes somewhat interesting and more importantly the graphic/set designs are simply incredible. Unfortunately, rather than make this an interesting movie about a psyche of a man with a hellish nightmarish side and a fun-loving cartoonish side to him, the movie decides to have the Monkeybone character inhabit Fraser's body on Earth. Antics -- unfunny -- ensue, as does a plot to poison people with nightmares. Anyway, the film is graphically impressive, especially when the action is taking place in Downtown.

While it has some of the imaginative art direction in those films, unfortunately it lacks their humor and is quite a bit less coherent.    Brendan Frasier plays Stu, a cartoonist who is injured in an accident and finds himself in a strange netherworld called Downtown which is a way station for people who are in comas and are waiting to see whether they will awaken or die.  Downtown is also the Land of Sleep, so besides being full of people in comas, it's populated by creatures from nightmares.  For entertainment, people's nightmares are shown continuously on televisions and in the movie theater (the Morpheum).  There are no happy dreams, and the nightmares are all the same.  In my nightmares the house is on fire, or I have to take a final exam but I don't know where the classroom is.  In Downtown the nightmares are all about strange creatures and carnival rides.  The place looks like a funhouse.  Stu is kept company by his cartoon creation, a rascally monkey named Monkeybone who acts and sounds an awful lot like an R rated version of Roger Rabbit.  Stu is desperate to return to the land of the awake because he wants to propose to his girl friend, Julie, played by Bridget Fonda, so he sneaks into the Land of Death and steals an exit pass (used for people who are almost dead but are revived at the last second), but just as he's about to leave Monkeybone steals the exit pass and uses it to escape to the real world where he inhabits Stu's body, turning Stu's life into mayhem.  Only Stu's dog seems to know there's something wrong here. It turns out that all the creatures in Downtown had conspired to let Monkeybone escape into the real world because Julie has a large quantity of a chemical that causes nightmares, and they want Monkeybone/Stu to release it on an unsuspecting population to create lots of new nightmares to keep Downtown entertained (seems there aren't as many nightmares as there used to be).  Stu is imprisoned in Downtown with a bunch of other people whose bodies also were snatched so that they could create nightmares (there's a cameo by Steven King), but he escapes and goes back to the Land of Death to try and steal another exit pass.  He gets caught, but the Angel of Death, played by Whoppi Goldberg (there's exactly 2 black people in this movie with speaking parts, one is the angel of death, and the other is the angel of nightmares) takes pity on him and sends him back into the body of a man, played by Chris Kattan, who is recently deceased and whose organs are being harvested at that very moment.  He leaps off the operating table and takes off in search of Julie and Monkeybone with the organ harvesters chasing after him.  Can he propose to Julie and stop Monkeybone from spraying crowds of people with nightmare juice before the end of the movie?  Will he have to go back to the Land of Death or will he get to live happily ever after?  You'd have to sit through this preposterous movie to find out, but I'll bet you could guess the answer.  It may seem to hard to believe but I simplified the plot in this comment; it's actually much more complicated. There is no charm to this movie.  There's no light-heartedness.  There's no fun.  Despite the funhouse atmosphere and busy plot, there's a surprising dullness and lack of imagination to all of it.  The trailer looked promising and I'm a big fan of both Brendan Frasier and Bridget Fonda, but this film was a major disappointment.

Part of the beauty in Nightmare Before Christmas is that all the beauty, or nightmare as the case may be, comes naturally. There are no such feelings of forcefulness about it. While watching Monkeybone, however, I could not help but picture Henry Selick sitting around some heavylooking table with other important looking men conversing the beginnings of this movie. Selick We have not had success as big since Nightmare Before Christmas artistically speaking. Now, I want to make a movie with the same creative artistic ideas. With the same dark twists, I can see the money coming in already. Muahahaha! 	Alright, so perhaps he did not treat anyone to the `Muahahaha', still, one can not help but envision it! The art in the movie, meaning all the costumes creatures, the land, the town, the whole shebang is a bit forced and thought up. It all felt as if it was trying to measure up to Nightmare, and fell short. A bit like when someone talks intelligently just to look intelligent, rather then cary the point across. Having said that, the movie was very tasty. Besides the art, which was not at all badly done after all, the plot was captivating, the characters amusing, and the idea unique and untouched (to my knowledge). Brendan Fraser does a splendid job of acting out the mischievous , horny monkey.  As far as just what sort of movie this is it feels more as a comedy with a dark twist at times, hence; dark comedy. As an added note, for all of ye out there saddened that this movie did not do as well as it could have. Think of it this way, If it did do well and did the whole toy selling thing that would go against Stu Miley's philosophy which was to stay quiet and to have all leave him alone. So, he shall be left.

I thought the Monkeybone character was well-done - you got a sense of canniness underneath the lascivious, fart-joke shtick that lent credibility to the alter-ego connection.I think Monkeybone is a worthwhile movie for anyone with an appreciation for Looney-Tunes style cartoon comedy; one of the best thing about Looney Tunes was their sometimes-dark undertones - cast in a wacky format, but still there - which unlike a lot of today's work I think this movie captures, and which separates pure slapstick from something a little more ironic and interesting.Anyway, if you aren't too offended by bodily-functions humor (not my favorite form, but it really was appropriate given the character and the premise), and your sense of humor runs toward the quirky and silly, you may want to give Monkeybone a shot.

However, what dark, twisted chasm did the script fall into?Brendan Fraser stars as Stu Miley, cartoonist who's creation Monkeybone (unrecognizably voiced by John Turturro) has landed him a TV series.  He and girlfriend Bridgette Fonda (in a thankless, 2-D role) abruptly become involved in a car accident, after which Stu falls into a coma and is whisked away to DownTown, a weighstation for souls as their fate is determined, and whose otherworldly, twisted array of characters thrive on the nightmares of humans.  Monkeybone hatches a plot to take over Stu's body and feed DownTown tons of fresh nightmares using a 'nightmare juice' created by Stu's girlfriend.Yes, it is original, but rarely does it ever get amusing.  The $70 million budget is clearly all on the screen, with, again, some technically dazzling and darkly creative sets and creatures, but the main characters are all severely underwritten.  Brend Fraser is appealing enough as Stu Miley, but Bridget Fonda has some of the worst dialogue of the year. The character of Monkeybone is a thoroughly annoying, unfunny creation.  Part Alf, part Pokemon, every line and scene from and about him is inherently grating.  Also, the funniest scene (which is truly laugh-out-loud), involving Chris Kattan as a recently killed gymnast, only comes toward the end of the movie.  If only the rest of the scenes could have been as cleverly written and performed as the final ones, Monkeybone would have worked.  Instead, we are given a visual knockout of a movie with no heart.

Although a strong dissapointment, Monkeybone delivers some great comedic comedy, the visually beautiful Downtown designed by Henry and some excellent stop-motion animation. The look and tone of the film is very sexual, something not explored in any of Selick's earlier films. Monkeybone, the title character from what I got while watching the film stands for the part of someone that gets aroused sexually and therefore the message at the end of the film `There's a little bit of Monkeybone in everybody' will make sense to those who got some of the subliminal messages. Besides the shock of there being sexual themes in a Selick film, there are some extremely well thought out and created visual effects and stop-motion animation special effects contained in the film. The film combines stop-motion animation and live action to the extent that hasn't been seen or attempted before. With scenes containing compositions between the puppet and the human actor they filmed the stop-motion monkey on a blue screen manaquin which is representing Brendan Fraiser in a scene when he must interact with the monkey. The cast is great- Brendan Fraiser, Bridget Fonda, Whoopi Goldberg and Chris Kattan. The film should have gotten an R rating for all of the sexual material represented in the film throughout but thus was rated PG-13. The editing is terrible and many characters are not introduced. A lot of stop-motion animation and scenes involving the relationship between Stu Miley and Kitty were cut which make scenes left in make little or no sense at all. The film's production was very slow and seemed to be a nightmare. The release date was in limbo for nearly 5 months until a trailer finaly appeared with the film Cast Away. The trailer made the film look like American Pie meets MTV. The film itself is a bit hard to describe. Indeed it does combine films like American Pie and Nightmare on Elm Street and uses the same kind of imagery from the Nightmare Before Christmas. But best of all this is something completely different from the usual brain-dead teen-age comedies that are being made today. It was a box office disaster and a failure to bring something new to screen. As it stands, it is a CULT classic and hopefully will achieve a Rocky Horror-like following sometime in the next 20 years.

If it had gone to the art circuit first, it probably would enjoyed a modest success, instead of attracting the vituperation of critics who don't appear to have understood what they saw.This is not a movie that fits easily into a genre, but it's a carnival ride, and worth the admission ticket.  Don't take the kids, but take your brain, and remember to have fun.  Carnival rides aren't all laughs, after all. The best ones scare you as much as they thrill.

It's just like the Nightmare Before Christmas in that it's visually stunning, and will draw a large cult crowd of all ages.

When Brendan Fraser winds up in a coma he is transported to Downtown, a stopping ground for souls in comas and awaiting death. Here he meets his alter-ego or his cartoon creation, Monkey Bone. In an attempt to bring his soul back to his body he is tricked and his creation Monkey Bone takes his place. What follows is a roller coaster ride (literally) trying to stop Monkey Bone's evil plans to give more people nightmares. I like Brendan Fraser and what he does with this role is great. Bridget Fonda, David Foley and Chris Kattan all fill their supporting roles with as much as they could considering the material. But that's the main problem. The film makers opting for a low-brow mentality. Stupid fart jokes and childish stunts ruin what could have been a great dark comedy. The animation in the coma sequences are in the same style as Nightmare Before Christmas and they look fantastic. Making this movie more for the kids only tamed it too much.  Kids will love it while adults might chuckle a few times but wind up only wishing for more.

Monkeybone isn't completely terrible, it's just that it isn't particularly good either. The visuals do look great, as Selick's output often does. The soundtrack is memorable and Kitty is hot. However, the characters are dull and lacking any sort of personality particularly Fraser. The story had a good premise but was overall uninteresting and drags badly towards the end. The script has a lot of unfunny jokes and the dialogue itself epitomises blandness. On paper the cast seemed like a winner, but you know there's something wrong when all of them including Bridget Fonda are bogged down by lame writing and a dull character each. Overall, a disappointing movie and Selick's worst. It is not as bad as a movie of this sort like Cool World, because at least Monkeybone looked great and made sense, Monkeybone's problems were that it was dull in the story and characters and that it was poorly written. 4/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Not Henry Selick's best, but a striking piece of work nonetheless","Date":"21 July 2007","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":" Henry Selick is one of the most underrated filmmakers at work in Hollywood today. He hasn't many features under his belt, but that's because of the effort he invests in his projects. His films take years to complete. Selick's trademark as a director is his love of stop-motion animation, where hand-crafted figures are manipulated an inch at a time. Its a lengthy, time-consuming process that requires a great deal of patience, but in all the films he's made, his perseverance has paid off, and he's turned out some truly stunning work.Although The Nightmare Before Christmas is credited as a Tim Burton film, it was directed by Selick. Together they created a breathtaking world, unlike any I've ever seen before or since. Selick then moved on to the adaptation of James and the Giant Peach, another excellent film. Both were box-office flops sadly, and Selick continues to struggle to find funding for his films as a result. And now we have Monkeybone, a film that attempts to merge stop-motion with live-action.Of Selick's films so far, Monkeybone feels the least satisfying. Maybe because it doesn't quite have the intelligence he brought to his previous work. This is pitched at a much more juvenile level. Brendan Fraser plays Stu Miley, a cartoonist who is the creator of Monkeybone, a wacky wisecracking chimp. After Stu gets in a car crash, he slips into a coma.And winds up in a bizarre buffer-zone between the land of the living and the dead. Populated by strange creatures of all kinds, even Stu's creation Monkeybone is here as a nightclub act. If Stu ever wants to wake up, he has to get an exit pass from Death (Whoopi Goldberg) to return to the waking world. Monkeybone helps him get one, but double-crosses him at the last moment, uses the pass to escape, wakes up in full control of Stu's body, where he wreaks havoc.There's quite a clever idea at the heart of Monkeybone. A figment of your imagination made flesh that tries to take over your life. But although Henry Selick can work marvels when it comes to the animated world, he seems less sure of himself when it comes to live action. When Selick directed James and the Giant Peach, the stop-motion scenes were wonderful, and carried by considerable charm and energy. But he bookended the film with live-action, and its clearly a medium he's not as comfortable in. Because Monkeybone relies on a lot of live-action, the film suffers as a result.A lot of the live-action scenes tend to degenerate into slapstick farce. An approach that would work fine in animation, but less so in live-action. Brendan Fraser is well suited to this type of material, and he plays the part of Monkeybone with a lot of enthusiasm, but I am starting to get a bit fed up of this kind of shtick that Fraser stars in, because its beginning to seem like the only kind of thing he can do.The most interesting aspects of Monkeybone are inside Stu's mind, where his consciousness is trapped in Downtown, a sort of waystation for lost souls. This is the part of the film that really comes alive, because Downtown's an extraordinary, eye-popping piece of set-design.Its filled with so many details I'm not sure where to begin in describing it. Its like a lunatic carnival if lorded over by Tim Burton. And the way Selick merges stop-motion animated creatures with live actors is quite remarkable. There are too many bizarre creatures to keep track of. Cyclops'. Yellow bulls. Giant sized wasps. But its just as astonishing as HalloweenTown, and even occasionally surpasses that inspired creation through sheer invention.The human cast is OK. Rose McGowan lends fine support as a catgirl who lives in Downtown. The sight of her in a catsuit is worth the price of admission alone! And Whoopi Goldberg makes a nicely exasperated Death.But Monkeybone is less than the sum of its parts. Its a film that doesn't go far enough. And substitutes crude toilet humour when the invention runs out. A failing that works against the film is the character of Monkeybone himself. He's not really an interesting character. He's just some obnoxious chimp who looks like he's wandered in from another film.Sadly, Monkeybone was another flop for Selick. Granted I was a little disappointed with it, especially when compared to Selick's previous work. Even if it has moments of real inspired lunacy, its just not up to the high standards of Henry Selick, and only seems to add a further nail into the coffin of his flagging career. And he's a man who really deserves much better.

The first thing that struck me about it was it was a story about a cartoonist who creates a character from every bit he hates about himself and makes him rich. Then it descended into chaos all about him being in a coma. It just goes on and on for an age about him being stuck in his own mental hell. It gives you a headache from the crap songs ,the psychotic characters and poorly Gothic set. If you want a decent Gothic comedy with annoying music at least look for one you have heard of. This film is a poor man's Nightmare before Christmas with extra LSD. Avoid this movie at all costs or at least make sure you have enough aspirin to avoid the migraines which ensue due to the music.

The DVD cover was very misleading, and made it look like a tasteless B-comedy; the names of Brendan Fraser, Bridget Fonda and Chris Kattan didn't do much good either. I never would have dreamed of picking it up in the video store if it wasn't for the director, his name hardly even noticeable on the back cover.Henry Selick is the man responsible for two of the most remarkable animation features of the 90s - James and the Giant Peach and The Nightmare Before Christmas (Tim Burton's vision, sure, but ultimately Selick's film). Both were sardonic, immensely stylish animated films and had some of the most wonderfully designed cartoon characters I've ever seen. Watching Monkeybone proves beyond doubt that even though Burton was the main brain behind The Nightmare Before Christmas, as far as design and character creation goes, most of the credit for the brilliant animation work should go to Mr. Selick. On Monkeybone Selick decided to make his first attempt at directing live actors, and does less than well. Aside from having a not very impressive lead actor in Brendan Fraser, most of the live action part of the film is - despite some moments of inspiration - not much more then slapstick and low-brow comedy. Sure, you may get a couple of cheap laughs out of Chris Kattan and Dave Foley, maybe even from Fraser (one of my least favorite actors, actually), but that section of the film is nothing to write home about.However... about half the film takes place in a fantasy world called Downtown, a place where the comatose souls live, waiting to die or to awaken into the real world. Not only is that world designed in the most wonderful sardonic humor of Henry Selick's previous exploits, it's horded with one of the most wonderful casts of animated monsters I've ever seen - one that would make Jim Henson proud. Selick does not once give in to computer generated animation; all of the characters are entirely mechanical. Real life animated figures have a feel to them that computerized characters could never have - the kind of feel the characters on Nightmare have or in Henson classics like Dark Crystal and Storyteller. Each of the monster characters in Monkeybone is an intricately designed, finely crafted living creature with immense personality. The fascinating extras on the DVD include a wonderful gallery of sketches for each of those characters, as well as an inside look on how they were created - there are some original and brilliant technical solutions for some of the characters. John Torturro supplies Monkeybone's hilarious voice in a performance that reminds me slightly of his memorable appearance in Miller's Crossing, and Whoopi Goldberg grants a lovely cameo.If you're reading this, you're one of two - either you're a Brendan Fraser or Chris Kattan fan, in which case you're likely to enjoy the slapstick humor of the real world section of the film, or you've heard about the film or about Henry Selick and are into it for the animation and design. From the point of view of an animator or anyone who is interested in the more classic side of animation, Monkeybone is a fascinating watch. Don't expect it to be another Nightmare Before Christmas, but try to ignore some of the dumb jokes and cheesy humor, and really get a load of the incredible work done on it. They just don't make animation like this anymore.By the way The Amazon.com editorial review said Fraser plays 'the best-looking cartoonist you'll ever see'. Wrong! You forgot one important precedent - Brad Pitt in Cool World. And the similarities between the two movies don't stop there. The design and styling, though, are entirely different.

Where's their sense of humor, their appreciation both of the absurd and the original? This has got to be one of the most imaginative, fun, and well-done fantasy flicks I've ever seen! First off, Brendan Fraser and Bridget Fonda are two of the most talented, sexy and gorgeous actors in the world. They are just about perfect in this film. I can't recall ever seeing Bridget Fonda in a comedy before, but she is as good in this film as she is in her most dramatic roles. Brendan Frasier never disappoints either, no matter what kind of film he's in. In this go-round, he is absolutely flawless as both Stu and Monkeybone. (Why is great comedic acting usually so under-rated?)Speaking of comedy, I've never been much of a fan of Chris Kattan, but seeing him as a corpse walking with a broken neck has got to be one of the funniest physical comedy bits I've ever seen in my life. He injects new life (!?) into the film near its end, just when you think that there can't possibly be any more wild surprises left! And how can ANYONE not laugh at first seeing what the Little Jack Horner monkey toy can do??? I almost fell off my chair laughing! Unlikely creatures abound in Stu's unconscious! They are as fun to watch as any I've ever seen in A Nightmare Before Christmas, Beetlejuice, or any other fantasy flicks I've ever seen. They are brought to life seamlessly by teams of brilliant animators. I think the very best one is the rolling, scrawny-legged egg-shaped body they gave to Giancarlo Esposito, another terrific actor I had no idea would be so funny in a comedic role.I had this flick on in the background while waiting for Larry King's show (!) to start in an hour, but, after the first very silly ten minutes or so, I found myself paying full attention to this movie in spite of myself. I got drawn in by the terrific actors, the outrageous situations, and the amazing animation.There are some great rock songs in the soundtrack, too.I really can't understand why anyone wouldn't be amused by this most unusual, fun flick! Yes, it has some sophomoric humor, but so what? I think that everyone just needs to sit back and enjoy, and not read too deeply into what they're watching. Let the child in you be amazed by the nightmarish visions and the endless visual surprises. I think I just might go and buy my own copy of Monkeybone! *** "},{"Title":"Brilliant, bizarre, something different for a change","Date":"26 August 2004","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  Monkeybone is a bit like that other mix of live action and animation which is Cool World (another movie I like for it's weirdness and adult nature). Both deal with the darker/adult side of cartoons but Monkeybone has a lot more going for it in terms of crazy, surreal & almost Pythonesque humour, some great special effects and likeable performers like Brendan Fraser, Bridget Fonda & Rose McGowan. Unlike Cool World which had lousy effects and dodgy acting. Both movies also have a rather good soundtrack.The DVD of Monkeybone is well worth getting for the extended scenes - some of which really should have been kept in the movie and just prove how stupid the rules are for cutting scenes just so they fit a certain running time. On my version of the DVD (could be a bug with my player) I couldn't get any commentary on the deleted scenes even though there is supposed to be (which I would have liked to have listened to).I'm pretty much glad Monkeybone was a bit of a flop (again like Cool World!) and I really can't imagine this movie being a hit with a mainstream audience anyway (all the better for that fact) even though I get the impression someone somewhere wanted to target a mainstream audience and dumbed the movie down a little bit...Monkeybone is a great fantasy movie aimed at a more grown-up audience. I'd go as far as to say that Monkeybone is a cult classic but it is a great pity that movies like this have to have certain scenes cut or trimmed to suit the studio's wishes (example Terry Gilliam's Brazil). There was obviously some far more darker & adult stuff in this movie before someone gave the order to lose it.Adults need more escapist fantasy movies like this - not everything to do with cartoons and comic books should be produced for the kiddy market. Unfortunately, far too many studios feel the need to dumb down everything so it apparently appeals to everyone of any age so I'm pleasantly surprised Monkeybone is as great as it is even if it obviously could have been more and probably was...

Unsurprising, since director Henry Selick has worked with Burton on two prior occasions.The film's visuals are top-notch - the Downtown area features an eclectic mix of stop-motion, CG animation and Jim Henson-esqué costuming, and excellent set-pieces, like the CG'd head of Abe Lincoln descending from the clouds. I can't fault it there.However - and you knew this was coming - Monkeybone, to me, seems disjointed. Barely ten minutes of screen time has passed since Stu entered Downtown, and already, a month has gone by? The aforementioned Kitty isn't even given an introduction - she's just there, and Stu suddenly knows her for no apparent reason.The actors give great performances - including Whoopi Goldberg as Death, one of whose scenes harks back to Men In Black, and Chris Kattan as the decomposing corpse of a star gymnast, being chased by a gang of red-cloaked doctors who are out for his organs.Nonetheless, Monkeybone is enjoyable. While not the box-office smash that everyone hopes their movies will be, it serves its purpose and provides an entertaining - if sometimes perplexing - hour and a half.
