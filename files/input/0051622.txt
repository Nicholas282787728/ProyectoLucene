Who could ever forget it.  At the age of 9 or so, I was a horror movie veteran, or so I thought.  I would attend the Saturday matinees of a local theater, armed with my THIRTY FIVE CENTS, which was good for an admission, a huge coke and a Butterfinger as long as my forearm.The theater was, as usual, very dark and of the 3,000 seats, 2996 we unoccupied, the norm on a Saturday afternoon.  The sunset times had been carefully memorized as to not be foolishly caught in the dark walking home from a horror flick.In spite of the subtle warnings from a couple of neighborhood kids who had already seen 'The Fly', I remained confident, having survived several movies, including 'Them' and 'The Invisible Man'.  The movie was terrifying enough, but nothing in my 9-year old brain prepared me for the absolutely numbing terror that assaulted my senses at the end of the movie.  My 16 oz. cup, containing now only ice left my grasp and clattered noisily on the cold floor and the last vestige of the sticky Butterfinger froze in my open mouth as I was transfixed on the terrifying ending.  I knew that I was in trouble.I walked the 3/4 mile home, BACKWARDS and in the middle of the street as to not encounter any bush or shrub, ALL of which I was sure contained the nightmarish image that was forever burned into my brain.  Now I understood why none of the kids who had seen the movie boasted or talked about it, they were  still too terrified.10/10 for terror.

Even now I cringe when I witness that nightmarish scene. As good as Cronenberg's movie is (and it is very good), there is nothing that surpasses the delirious horror of the man-fly in the spider's grasp.Elsewhere, the movie is rather subdued. In some spots, almost too much so. Although the first revelation of The Fly's appearance is another classic spot...the multiple reflections was a great touch. Like all great monsters, the Fly has a very sympathetic edge to it. We are revolted by the horror of this monster but we feel overwhelming pity for him as well.Vincent Price does a workman-like job in a rather blasé part. Usually he adds a special touch to a film, but really, any number of actors could have played his part here.The scientific basis of this movie is pure rubbish, as there is no way that insect and human parts could biologically interact with each other. The result of such a mixture would be instantly dead in real life.But that doesn't matter here. A nightmare has its own logic. And The Fly is a nightmare.

Then again that WHUMP ... is there another sound experience that reverberates through a movie like that?Sure, surround sound, THX, all that tech stuff, but the sound as the manifestation of the crime that encircles this story, the horror as the mind tries to put together the images that (finally) is seen in a flashback as this scene bookends the start and finish of the plot.The inner struggle of the scientist as he fights with his human hand to control the spasms of his fly arm is both horrible and heart-wrenching.The shock as the cloth is torn away from the scientist's head... the fly's POV shot with facets and mirrors of the the screaming face of the scientist's poor wife!

Sure these later gorefest horror films are good. I buy them all the time. But they are a different genre. The Fly with Vincent Price is NOT the same story as The Fly with Jeff Goldblum.

Help me! scene. But of course the number one reason being that this is the original to the remake with Jeff Goldblum which is an incredible movie in itself, but I was curious what the original would be about. Honestly I was thinking that it was going to be very cheesy, it's a 1950's horror movie that would probably be over the top, but honestly, from the very beginning you get gore, which was odd, but sickly enough I love it! I am also a huge Vincent Price fan, this is the man of the classic B horror movies and his voice and presence make these movies worth the watch. So I finally got to see this on netflix, I absolutely loved The Fly. Is this better than the remake? Honestly, the remake is more realistic on what would happen if this really did occur, but don't overlook the original, as cheesy as a fly in a giant trench coat can be, it's all good and this story is tons of fun and really scary.A woman named Helene Delembre phones her brother-in-law, Francois Delambre to tell him that she has just murdered her husband. Francois calls in the police and she admits killing him but refuses to say why. Later, Francois tricks her into telling the story to him and Police Inspector Charas. A scientist, Andre Delambre, has invented a teleportation device. After a few failed attempts, he succeeds with living organisms, deciding to go for the ultimate risk and transport himself. The first time works, but, unknown to him, a fly enters the cabin with him and the two are hopelessly scrambled together. The scientist emerges as a half-man, half-fly, a human with a fly's head, leg and arm/claw. His wife finds out something is wrong as she now sees him with a cloth over his head and a hidden arm. He eventually tells his wife what has happened and she first sees his claw and screams, then later sees his fly head and screams more. His wife, son and maid try to find the fly with a white head and fail. The son had caught it just after the accident but had been made to let it go, before any of them knew what it was. Andre attempts to reverse the process to return himself to normal, but fails and when he realizes that his mind is being overtaken by that of the fly he asks his wife to end his suffering by killing him with a heavy machine press.The Fly is a fantastic and thrilling movie. I know that the ending sequence of Help me! Help me! was cheesy and over the top to some, but to me it was just plain creepy, it really scared me. The whole atmosphere of the film just felt uncomfortable and disturbing. Granted, I know these were not top of the line make up effects with the fly, I do have to laugh juts a little bit with seeing a fly in a trench coat. But still it was effective and made for a great sci-fi story. I love these old movies for a specific reason, this was the time when film meant something to the cast and crew making it and The Fly was made to give people the chills. It's just rare now-a-days, if this was made in today's world, it would be all gore and just stupid. So I do recommend that you see this film if you are looking for a good scare. Both this and the remake are terrific films and are a ton of fun to watch.8/10 "},{"Title":"creepy beyond compare","Date":"12 November 2005","Score":"22 out of 24 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" in terms of creepiness, this flick takes a back seat to no horror film. the goldblum et al remake is a gory over-the-top, special-effects show-off in comparison. instead this one grabs your psychological neck, shakes it about and forces you to answer serious questions regarding the scientific exploits of man. while doing so it hermetically seals you in a world of misguided, pitiless hubris. if that sounds like a bit too much, just give it your time and try to go to sleep without thinking, why the hell would anyone proceed so far and without thinking of ways to save the poor, doomed scientist. it is a tale of inevitability and loss that brings into stark contrast the foolish doings of man against a backdrop of an inhumane and unforgiving nature. view at your own risk... do not view at your own horror- enjoyment's peril!

Her husband was a scientist who was deeply into his work and through those long days and weeks he makes a big breakthrough in science by inventing a teleportation machine that can transmit matter from one spot to another. After some glitches he fine tunes the device and decides to test it by using himself as a guinea pig. While, in the process of this test, a housefly gets caught inside with him and when he emerges from the other capsule he shares its genetic structure and physical attributes.The Fly is classic Sci-Fi / horror from the 50s and what a nice surprise this was! Unlike many of its kind in the 50s, this one didn't have a childish feel. The context may seem silly here, but its executed with enough skill and handled in a relax manner by director Kurt Neumann to set above the rest. Just don't be expecting a monster on the rampage tale. This one veers more towards a much more broaden and imaginative story with a certain eeriness contained in its psychological material rather than visuals. Even though it doesn't scare you witless, it still does provide a couple of memorable and ingenious shocks that are hard to put out of your mind. The film opens with the horrific outcome of Helene's husband Andre and then it goes into flashback mode where we learn the fate of Dr. Andre Delambre. What does make it surprisingly good is that we're treated with such passionately vivid characters and a interesting set-up that pulls you in by taking a more serious approach with a dabble of irony along the way. The talkative first hour slowly builds up to its taut last half-an-hour, where we get a smart and venomously bleak climax. Although, it could have done without that preachy conclusion. The rational script by James Clavell works by being incredibly dense with it thriving on some quick wit and sincerity. The story is more about a woman trying to save the man she loves as he slowly fights the genetic effects of the fly's DNA. He may seem hideous on the outside, but inside he is still more so human and he's trying his best to keep control of his dieing humanity. This is proved by how much he cares for his family's safety when he's willingly to take his own life for the best of everyone. It's practical story telling at its best. The look of the film is top shape with it being shot in vibrant Technicolor and the key is that the deformity is kept hidden, but when it's revealed it actually stands up rather well. It's ugly, that's for sure, but still it looks rather competent. They're also an inventive touch when we see the creature for the first time with multiple frames being used to represent the reflection from human fly's eyes. In Cronenberg's version we see the grotesque transformation, but because of the times and effects we don't see it here, but more so the aftermath of the mishap. All of the devices and gadgets in Andre's lab are well presented and the mounted score adds in a forceful touch with nice crisp sound effects. The performances are more than great by the likes of Al Edison, Patricia Owens, and Herbert Marshall and even though Vincent Price had a supporting role, you'll be in awe of his effortlessly suave performance.An excellent classic of its field that's more concern about telling a moving and fascinating story than just giving us pointless action and cheap thrills to spice up proceedings. The more you stick it out, the more compelling it does become.

The Fly is a genuine horror / sci-fi classic and fundamental viewing for everyone who was ever interested in either of these (or both, of course) genres. The whole premise of this milestone is silly and incredibly grotesque, yet very disturbing and it's brought to an even higher quality-level by the top-class performances of a devoted cast. Hedinson stars as the brilliant scientist Andre Delambre who discovered a method to transfer matter from one capsule to another and &#150; convinced of his safety &#150; he uses himself as a guinea pig to test if it works with humans, too. Terror begins when an ordinary housefly accidentally makes the transfer with him and the two beings exchange heads and a limb. Slowly going mad, Hedison has to beg his wife Helene to destroy what's left of him and his invention, because it's too dangerous for the world. One of the reasons why this film is so compelling is because of the ingenious structure. The story opens with Hedinson's brother (another great role for Vincent Price) receiving a call from a hysterical Helene who claims to have killed her husband and, for a long time, we're left in the dark whether she committed an act of madness&#133;or a favor to her husband. The Fly contains several classic scenes (in one way or another, everybody must know about the spider-web finale by now) and the special effects are more than satisfying. Great film!

It starts out with the discovery by a night watchman of the grisly killing of scientist Andre Delambre (Al Hedison aka David Hedison) apparently at the hands of his wife Helene (Patricia Owens). She calls Andre's brother Francois (Vincent Price) to tell him of the tragedy. Francois in turn, calls in Inspector Charas (Herbert Marshall) and together they question Helene to try to find out what happened. In a flashback, we learn that Andre had been experimenting with transporting matter at light speed from one point to another. When he reached the stage of using a human in the tests, he had used himself. Unfortunately, when he transported himself, unbeknownst to him a common fly had been in the disintegrator with him. When they re-integrated things were not quite as they had been before. Of course no one really believes Helene's story until Francois and the Inspector are shown the unfortunate fly by Andre and Helene's son Philippe (Charles Herbert). Director Kurt Neumann builds up the suspense by first letting us guess what has happened in the laboratory and then delaying the unmasking of Andre as long as possible. That scene reminded me of the unmasking of the Phantom in Lon Chaney's The Phantom of the Opera (1925). The wide screen is used to great effect in that scene when Helene first sees what has happened to her husband, and we then see multiple images of her, much in the way that we believe a fly would see it, screaming in terror. The fly makeup was, I thought, quite convincing and who can ever forget the final scene when a spider is closing in on the title character (Help me, please...Help me..).

As I recall, this sci-fi epic played at our uptown theater, where prestige pictures normally played. Usually, we teenagers had to go to a drive-in to catch these 50's monster movies. But this one was produced by big-budget TCF and in Technicolor, unlike the usual Roger Corman low-budget b&w's. Plus, it got promoted more heavily than the usual under-the-radar sci-fi. I suspect big-budget MGM's success with Forbidden Planet (1956) had something to do with TCF's decision to join the swim.On the whole, it's a good entry from that period, more carefully thought out than most, with a name cast, well almost. Patricia Owens (the wife) may not be a household name, but she does do a heckuva job in putting the material over. She's the pivotal character, and it's her range of reactions that almost make the premise believable. Plus, it's a very cleverly structured screenplay, hooking us right away and then explaining the mystery through flashback. On the downside is the rather bland Hedison. Seeing him now, after so many years, he doesn't seem the driven-genius type, his casting likely a gesture to commercialism. A lot of folks find the climax amusing. And while the special effects are not very good, the idea itself is pretty effective as tragic outcome. On the whole, the movie may not reach the sustained intensity of the similar Incredible Shrinking Man (1957). Nonetheless, I still think my teenage fifty-cents was well spent.(In passing-- I'm still wondering how our scientist gets a fly's head, but not its brain. After all, he does continue to reason. Oh well, no one watches these epics for their logic, then or now.)

First, the bad quality of its two sequels turned the horror of the first into campy silliness; and second and more important, the fact that David Cronenberg's 1986 remake is a perfect film in every sense sent the movie to oblivion almost instantly. A shame indeed, as The Fly is more than a simple creature feature, it is a powerful mix of Gothic horror and science-fiction with something very important that distinguish it from the rest of the movies of its era a good dose of class.On a dark night, François Delambre (Vincent Price), receives the most tragic news he could had received, his dear brother Andre (David Hedison) has been murdered and the killer is no one else than Andre's beloved wife, Helene (Patricia Owens). Everything points out to insanity as the cause of the murder, but as Helene tells the tragic story behind the murder, François and his good friend, the Insp. Charas (Herbert Marshall), discover a grotesque tale of science gone wrong, very wrong.Kurt Neumann, a veteran director who spent the 40s making the famous Tarzan series of movies with Johnny Weissmuller, brought the class of the old style of the 30s film-making to George Langelaan's tale of love and horror. Neumann finds the perfect equilibrium between Gothic atmospheres and the beautiful color technique, in a very good mix between old style and modern (for its time) technology. The suspense is superbly handled and while the slow pacing of the film may turn off modern viewers, it is vital for the shock and power of the two crucial final scenes.Like Cronenberg's remake, the movie's main theme is love, but unlike the modern version, here the focus is on Andre's wife Helene, who must face her fears in order to save her husband of the cruel fate his accident unleashed. Neumann carefully builds up the relationships between characters in a way that makes us care for them, making the fatal accident even more dreadful and frightening as the family's life will never be the same after it.Patricia Owens is terrific as the main character, and it is her character the one that carries the film. She is perfect as the woman who would do anything to save the man she loves, and her performance transmits the emotions of despair and angst in a very believable way. David Hedison is very good as Andre, and while at first he seems quite average, his performance as the mute monster is outstanding. Vincent Price may be only a supporting actor here, and in a very different role than we are used to see him. However, he delivers his lines with his usual charm and his presence fits perfectly the classy elegance Neumann crafted in the film.Of course, one has to talk about the special effects, as this is where the movie has dated the most. Nowadays, and thanks to the silly make-up used in the following sequels, the Fly's make-up is seen as clumsy instead of grotesque and its impact has been enormously diminished; however, it is safe to say that contrary to its sequels, here they still work, thanks to Neumann's choice of showing them only in the crucial moments. Depsite being clumsy and silly for today's standards, The Fly's special effects still manage to give the scares.The Fly has been definitely overshadowed by its superior remake, however, this film still has a lot of power and despite having two silly films as sequels, this one has a characteristic that makes it stand out among the rest, it has that class and elegance that old Gothic horrors of the 30s had. It is a shame that Neumann didn't live to see the success of The Fly, but at least he finally got the chance to show his talents in this powerful horror movie. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Classic 1950s pop-horror, gets under your skin","Date":"7 July 2010","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" The Fly (1958)You might be convinced to see a movie just because it has Vincent Price and Herbert Marshall in it--they come from different backgrounds, but both are serious actors with nuance and clearly chiseled personalities. And they definitely raise the movie up.But it's the story that is the star here. A Ray Bradbury kind of science fiction, where a futuristic idea enters middle America, and where something goes terribly, bizarrely wrong. If you think about it it's disturbing, but the movie doesn't pause to let you think. One of its strengths is that it never flags. And the main character, the handsome father and scientist (who creates the invention of the century in his basement), is brilliant. He's suave, alternately relaxed and obsessed, reasonable and believable even when talking about the unbelievable.The flaws are so obvious they you can skim over them--the fly effects at the end, their stupidity at catching and losing the fly, the notion of insanity, the television kind of family interactions--but it does make the movie more of an entertainment than some fine art classic.

My rating should be proof of that. But am I alone in thinking that The Fly may be a bit overrated? Actually, the term overrated is probably the wrong word as I'm not talking about the movie's rating per se. What I mean, is there anyone who cares that is not familiar with the movie or some of the more iconic images from The Fly whether they've seen the movie or not? Sure the movie is great once the creature makes an appearance, but for 2/3 of the film, it's pure melodrama of the worst kind.Another question I have regarding The Fly, why is this seemingly one of Vincent Price's most beloved movies? He's neither villain nor hero &#150; he's just there. So why all the acclaim for Vincent Price when it come to The Fly? I don't get it.But what I do understand about The Fly is that regardless of my problems and questions, it's a fun movie that never fails to entertain. The acting is solid and the movie looks great. The Fly actually features some real atmosphere. And I find the unmasking scene second only to the one in The Phantom of the Opera (1925) as far as iconic scenes of this type go.

When she reveals that she unknowingly released the white-headed fly that could reverse his hideous mistake, Andre rises angrily from his desk, and we notice that his left hand has been hideously replaced by a hairy insect claw. Immediately, we understand that something truly horrific has happened to Helene's beloved husband.Until this second moment, Andre has been very careful to keep his appearance hidden from his wife (and from us). At Helene's urging, he agrees to go through the teleportation device again, on the off-chance that it precipitates a reversal in the original transmutation. The procedure offers the audience a momentary glimmer of hope (despite our already knowing Andre's eventual fate), and when Helene suddenly tears off Andre's hood to prove that everything is normal again, we receive quite a horrific shock. A hideous fly's head, complete with glowing red eyes and a quivering proboscis, has taken the place of Andre's. We glimpse Helene's screams of terror through the fly's mosaic compound vision, and we instantly know that the mind behind this vision is doomed.The third moment is well-known, and long-remembered by all who see this film. After Helene, following her husband's final wish, kills him in the metal press, Andre's brother François (Vincent Price) must find the elusive white-headed fly to prove Helene's story to the detective in charge of investigating Andre's death (Herbert Marshall). Helene's young son, Phillipe (Charles Herbert), is the one who eventually finds it. Entangled in a spider web, the fly &#150; with Andre's screaming head protruding from its abdomen! &#150; is about to be attacked by the resident arachnid. Inspector Charis (Marshall) mercifully kills both the spider and the insect with a rock. Andre's unimaginable suffering has finally come to an end...

At least Neumann (working from a script by James Clavell, yes you read that right, the author of Noble House and Shogun wrote this) had the sense to apply logic here if a man's DNA crossed a fly's, parts would be mixed up, yes.

Nonetheless, he does his usual good job in a thankless role as the brother of The Fly.But what makes The Fly such a standout feature is not the effects, although they are well done. It's actually about something people. Most effects movies of today think that it is the effects that are the whole show. Not true. What good are effects if you don't have anyone you care about. That was the big problem about Godzilla 1998, despite the crappy looking monster. My only gripe about this film is that we don't get to know enough about the main character.

It is one of those special films that lasts with you from the very first time you see it and leaves its indelible marks on your psyche forever. There are scenes in this film which are still strong ones today. The story is simple enough. The film opens with a woman being accused of killing her husband by having a huge hydraulic press - not once but twice - descend on her husband's head and upper torso. We then through the manipulation of a brother-in-law, played subtly by none other than Vincent Price, get the real story about what happened via flashback. Patricia Owens plays the pretty wife very nicely and David Hedison her pre-head-crushed husband in the flashback sequences. Hedison is a scientist and has been playing with transfer of matter and, well, to spin a story most of you know very well, things get distorted when there is a mix-up in transference and a common house fly is involved. The film is shot lushly in beautiful colour by Kurt Neumann. Neumann as a director creates a brisk pace, actually shows little real horror but keeps the tension up through suggestion. There are scenes where he does show us the Fly and you can imagine the stir it caused at the time as it is flawless costuming and special effects. In fact everything about the production values are first-rate. The script is very good as well as are the performances. Hedison and Owens do very well as the leads. Price is very good in a supporting yet necessary role. The ever urbane Herbert Marshall is droll as ever as a police detective and Charles Herbert does a fine job as the young son. Look for Jerry Lewis thwart Kathleen Freeman as a house maid. The Fly has everything going for it and is rich in every sense of artistic endeavour for a film. There is no denying that the final scene or the cry Help me! Help me! have not resonated well past the film's inception. Those words and that scene with Price and Marshall have endured and will continue as an example of what good film-making can do.

James Clavell's adaptation of the George Langelaan story is very well conceived for the screen, the cast does a good job with the characters, and Kurt Neumann's direction makes fine use of the possibilities in the material.Although the story is a familiar one, one of the classics of its kind, if you happen never to have read it or seen any of the movie versions, it would probably be most enjoyable to go into it without knowing anything at all. But even for those who are very familiar with the various versions of the story, this one still works quite well. One of the things it does particularly well is that it patiently builds up the suspense, and it hints at various possibilities just long enough so that the key developments will have the maximum effect.Herbert Marshall and Vincent Price work well as the pair who is trying to figure out a very mysterious state of affairs, and Patricia Owens gives her character the right blend of charm and extreme anxiety. As the scientist André, David (Al) Hedison is pretty bland in his earlier scenes, but once the mishap occurs, his gestures and mannerisms work well in conveying his desperation and the fearful possibilities it has brought.The special effects are wisely used with restraint, and although the story itself is good enough that it does not have to rely on them to have an effect, the visual tricks do look quite good for their time. The movie overall still looks very good, and it deserves its place as one of the most popular movies of its kind.

This idea has been used later in the Star Treck series under the name of beaming and thus become quite popular.From the standpoint of theoretical physics, tele-transportation is principally possible, i.e. first de-materialization, then transportation and then re-materialization of objects. Although technics is not yet ready, there are no principle obstacles as long as dead objects have to be transported. But it is quite different with living organisms. Unlike an object like a stone which is a pure quantitative item, organisms involve quality. But in physics, there are only quantitative conservation laws, not qualitative ones. Therefore, before it will be technically possible to tele-transport an organism, physics must be able to handle with qualitative conservation, since otherwise the tele-transporting system will handle organisms like dead objects, and all quality will be lost during transportation.But qualitative conservation requires a fundamental change of our whole science, since it presupposes the exchange of mono-contextural by poly-contextural logic, i.e. the fundamental concept of two-valued logic has to be abandoned in order to transgress the metaphysical border between subject and object. Only when the subject-object border will be abolished, qualitative conservation will be possible. The reason is that dead objects are not capable of self-reflexion and therefore remain objects, while organisms have an environment and can thus be subject and object at the same time. As a matter of fact, this capability only enables them to reproduce themselves. Stones cannot reproduce themselves. Since de- and re-materialization is a reproductive device, tele-transportation requires polycontextural computers.The motive of the Fly-movies can be seen as a consequence of Einstein's relativity theories which are based on quantitative conservation laws which, however, are based again on the quantitative conservation laws that had been already formulated at the end of the 19th century. And it was at that time, to be exact in 1892, when the idea of complementing quantitative by qualitative conservation appears for the first time as a metaphysical topic in the work of the German psychiatrist and philosopher Oskar Panizza. But speculations concerning qualitative conservation go back at least to the church father Gregor von Nyssa in his discussion about the resurrection of the dead at doomsday Will the dead resurrect in their original shape which they had during their life-time or will they be changed, and if, how will their shape and character look like after they will have resurrected? Will different persons get mixed up or will everybody conserve his own qualities? These exciting ideas were discussed as early as in the 4th century A.D. but got popular only with the Fly-movies which therefore have a metaphysical background involving theoretical physics, cybernetics, mathematics and semiotics that goes far beyond common horror movies. Early American science fiction of the beginning of the 20th century anticipated present day's monocontextural computers. It is thus to await that newer American science fiction anticipates also the future's polycontextural computers.

The Fly works from the offset because of the presence of an intriguing mystery, and from there we move on to a classic tale of suspense and mad science. The film is based on a story by George Langelaan, and follows the terrifying idea of an experiment going horribly wrong for the brilliant scientist behind it. This story has spawned numerous other films based on similar ideas, but this is the original and - aside from the eighties remake by David Cronenberg - still the best. The film opens when François Delambre receives a phone call from his sister-in-law, Helene Delambre. She tells François that she has just killed her husband (his brother) in a hydraulic press. The reasons for this tragedy are unclear at first, and after she is declared insane; Helene Delambre decides to recite the tale to her brother-in-law and the police inspector. She tells them of how Andre Delambre built and later became obsessed with a machine that can be used to teleport matter. The problems started for him when he tried to teleport himself, and a fly got into the chamber with him...This film was one that helped to establish the great Vincent Price as one of the masters of the horror genre. His role here isn't the central one, although he certainly does stand out among the rest of the cast. David Hedison is given the leading man role as the unfortunate scientist, and while he's not bad - he doesn't really convince that he's got much of a brain if you ask me. Patricia Owens is the leading lady, and screams well when needed, while also impressing during the desperate parts where she and her son are frantically looking for a fly. Special effects are obviously important in a film like this, and although the film was hampered by a low budget and the fact that it was made almost fifty years ago, the special effects do still retain their campy 'fun' feel. The Fly is one of the few films to have been bettered by a remake, and while this film is nowhere near as terrifying as the eighties version, it has a great innocence to it and because of the distinct difference in style, the two cannot be compared on the same merits. Overall, this version of 'The Fly' is a great little film and one that must be seen by all lovers of the great horror genre!

Vincent Price, the most European of all American actors, had not established yet his status as an icon of the horror and fantastic genre &#x96;the Roger Corman films would help him to achieve that-, and Herbert Marshall, although never a leading star, he certainly was one of the most recognisable and solid supporting actors of the studio era. The Fly is about a scientific experiment going wrong. And when atomic energy is involved, one can be sure that the result is not only going to be disastrous but also gruesome. We have seen the tele-transportation process hundreds of times in Star Trek, and because of that we take it almost for granted even if we know it is sheer fantasy. But, who knows if it won't be a possibility in two or three hundred years from now? As André says to his wife Helene If fifty years ago someone had explained to my father the concept of television, he would have laughed his head off It is an interesting idea and by no means ridiculous. André succeeds tele-transporting a saucer and a newspaper, and all seems to be under control. Full of confidence, he then tries with the family cat, and it is there when things go awry. The poor animal disintegrates all right, but then it doesn't materialise again as expected. His atoms go lost forever in the limbo of infinity. Andre should take this as a warning and stop playing Dr Frankenstein, but he is too obsessed with his dream by now and won't give it up. The successful experiment with a guinea pig, a few days later, restores his confidence. We never see him trying the experiment on himself, which I think was a wise decision by the director because then it puts us in Helene's place when she first enters the laboratory after the mutation. We learn that André suffered an accident, he keeps his head covered with a cloth, he can't speak and he is desperate to find a particular fly. We can guess he has been disfigured, but then, what does a fly have to do with it? The film keeps us in suspense as the wife, the little boy and the foolish maid go around the house trying to catch the fly in question in what is an almost comical sequence the wife is almost paranoid, the kid thinks it is just a game, and the maid thinks that her lady has lost one or two screws all of a sudden. The scene in which Helene snatches the cloth off André's head to see his face, revealing so his nightmarish mutation, is still quite shocking for today's standards, and the make-up is remarkably good with those balloon-like eyes and the fly's snout twitching all the time. Apparently, the actress didn't see the make-up until the very moment the scene was shot, and so her hysterical reaction was totally spontaneous and genuine. That was another clever idea of the director. And another interesting detail he offers us is the POV shot of the fly in multi- images, because that is believed to be how insects see the world. Their eyes are formed by hexagonal tubes that are supposed to give them a cell-like vision. The Fly is definitely a piece that couldn't be missed in my film collection.

Any hope that this might be reversed - with or without the fly - seems forlorn, to them and us. But love can conquer this, right? Yes, but only to a point, the point being where hope ends and hopelessness begins.Vincent Price is a nice guy and, for me, does that far more believably than his usual Dr Nasty roles.This 50's sci-fi horror classic is, like many films of that era, engrossing, pacey and flawless.

The movie starts out as a mystery with the wife of the inventor being caught allegedly murdering the husband by crushing his head and arm under a hydraulic press at his brother-in-law's workplace. The brother-in-law, played by Vincent Price, cares deeply for his sister-in-law, played by Patricia Owens, but doesn't understand why she did this. She appears crazy by doing things like being obsessed about finding a white-headed fly and even appears slightly happy about her husband's death. The authorities believe she is crazy, but they go ahead and listen to her story once she decides to fess up. At this point, the movie goes into flashback mode as we see the events unfold. What makes this movie work is that it is a good story, and the acting & characterizations are good enough to make you care for them. This older movie doesn't focus on special effects, but pulls you in with the storyline. The only time the movie gets a little corny is at the very end where they attach a everything-is-swell Hollywood ending, but the rest of the movie is believable and played out well. This is billed as a monster movie, but is really a character story with some weird fly-attached-to-human subplots. Don't miss this classic movie, in my opinion it's one of the best sci-fi films of all time for any era.

With today's viewing, I'm pleased to honor it with my vote for best horror film made in color that should have been done in black and white. That's how I remember it, along with Vincent Price's other classics of the era - 1959's The Bat and House on Haunted Hill. Those WERE in glorious B&W and I couldn't think of them in any other way.Say, did you catch that great, almost subliminal fly buzzing in the opening credits set to music? That was a neat touch setting the stage for the horror to follow. And horror there was, although interspersed with comic elements that oozed their way through, unintentional though they might have been. Like when Helene Delambre (Patricia Owens) gets hysterical at the housekeeper (Kathleen Freeman) and demands - I told you to find that fly! There's also the double entendre moment near the end when Francois (Price) demands of Inspector Charas (Herbert Marshall) a way to redeem his sister-in-law of murder. His response - There is, show me the fly! No need to get into the nuts and bolts of the story here, enough reviewers on this board have done that already. However I haven't read about anyone making the connection between Andre Delambre's (Al/David Hedison) teleportation machine and the beam me up chamber 'Star Trek' would utilize less than a decade later. I don't recall any reconstructed cellular mishaps on that show, although I could be wrong about that. Now there would have been a story.So you have that great fly head making up the creature costume, along with the claw-arm that goes into histrionic fits whenever Helene is around. Goes to show what can be done with the power of suggestion over huge and expensive special effects. The multiple view image of Helen through the fly eyes was also a neat touch. Makes me wonder though how a fly ever manages to find anything when an object is all over the place. Have to think about that.If you can't get enough of pictures like these, I've already mentioned a couple of Vincent Price's classics earlier. For a more direct knock off of The Fly, you only need look again to the following year, 1959, when Roger Corman did a nifty little creature feature called The Wasp Woman, proving once again that beauty is only skin deep. Had the producers gone the extra mile, they could have staged a wedding film between The Fly and The Wasp Woman. The sequels alone would have kept them busy as bees. "},{"Title":"Help me!

The plot revolves around the mysterious death of a successful scientist who seems to have been murdered by his loving wife. She refuses to discuss the incident but her sudden insistence on finding a fly with a certain peculiar characteristic may hold the key to the mystery.The screenplay sticks pretty close to the source material with James Clavell's changes & additions fitting in well with the rest of the material. While ostensibly a science fiction/horror flick, The Fly also functions as a compelling mystery, much like the short story upon which it is based.The cast is pretty decent but ultimately nothing to get too excited about. Sure, it's got Vincent Price but it's not really the sort of part that he was best in. Herbert Marshall's here as well while David (Al) Hedison & Patricia Owens turn in acceptable performances.Despite the film's B-movie status the technical aspect wasn't neglected. Kurt Neumann's direction and the Paul Sawtell score get the job done and the special effects were handled by four time Oscar winner L.B. Abbott.Judging from the IMDb rating, The Fly seems to be an underrated film these days. That may be due to unfair comparison with Cronenberg's 1986 remake, which is naturally more attuned to modern tastes. For my money, both versions are well worth watching.

The film is based on George Langelaan's short-story of the same name, and has since been the basis for two sequels and a 1986 remake by David Cronenberg (which is equally recommended), as well as countless references, spin-offs and spoofs. This is one of the films that made the unmatched Vincent Price (my favorite actor ever) the great Horror icon he is. The film's storyline may sound corny, but it is actually incredibly creepy and effective. The film begins when Francois Delambre (Vincent Price) receives a phone-call from his sister-in-law, who tells him that she has just killed his brother in a hydraulic press - for reasons that seem unclear at first. After she is declared insane, she decides to tell Francois and the investigating police detective about the story behind the. Her husband, Andre Delambre (David Hedison), a scientist has created a teleportation device. An experiment with himself gone wrong lead to a terrible accident involving a fly... The Fly is a fascinating film on many levels. One reason to see it, of course, is the great Vincent Price. Price doesn't play the central character here, and the character he plays is also not a typical one. As opposed to many of his other films, Price does not play a sinister or macabre character here, but is basically THE reasonable character in the film. Yet, The Fly is one of the films that made Price become the great Horror icon he is. The other performances are also great, by the way. The story is absolutely fascinating, even if it may seem cheesy when reading about it. The film includes several brilliant scenes that are simply unforgettable once one has seen them. The first appearance of the fly-man, as well as ingeniously creepy cobweb-sequence is particularly memorable scenes which fans of cinema can not allow themselves to miss. The Fly is an amazing film, and an absolute must-see for all Sci-Fi/Horror fans. Highly recommended!

Things go awry when his genes are crossed with those of a common fly, thereby resulting in a grotesque humanoid insect monster. Andre's loyal and loving wife Helene (superbly played by the lovely Patricia Owens) desperately tries to help him out, but his humanity starts to fade as the days wear on. Director Kurt Neumann, working from an absorbing and intelligent script by James Clavell, relates the arresting, if wildly implausible story at a steady pace, maintains an admirably serious and sincere tone throughout, and elicits uniformly fine acting from a first-rate cast. Hedison and Owens are outstanding in the leads; they receive sound support from the ever-suave Vincent Price as Andre's concerned brother Francois, Herbert Marshall as the smooth Inspector Charas, comic actress Kathleen Freeman in a nifty change-of-pace straight part as housekeeper Emma, and Charles Herbert as Andre's sweet son Philippe. The vibrant color cinematography by Karl Struss makes exquisite use of the widescreen format. Paul Sawtell's lush, rousing orchestral score really hits the shuddery spot. The special effects are quite good and convincing. The revelation of the fly head atop Andre's body still packs a punch today; ditto the now legendary ending scene with Andre's head on a fly's body pathetically screaming Help me! while trapped in a spider's web. Moreover, this film gains considerable dramatic power from the fact that at the plot's core is a genuinely tragic and poignant love story. Although a bit slow and talky by modern standards, this picture overall is still worthy of its classic status.

The locale is Montreal and there is a definite French flavor to the movie. The well-known author James Clavell wrote the screenplay and the story switches back and forth from the present to the events of the past few weeks and days, told in flashback sequences. While 'The Fly' adheres to many horror film conventions, such as the zealous scientist going too far in his experiments and 'playing God,' it does so in a more stylish way than most other horror/sci-fi movies of the fifties. David (here, 'Al') Hedison and Vincent Price star as the scientist and his brother, respectively, but it is really Patricia Owens as Helene Delambre, the scientist's wife, who carries the film. She convincingly relays the maddening ordeal both she and Andre (her husband) must endure once a teleportation experiment of his goes horribly wrong. Alternately panicky then resolved, resolute then terribly frightened, Owens is very good at portraying a woman running the gamut of emotions. At one point, she even feigns insanity to protect her husband and child. Hedison is fine too, in a part that has him wearing a black cloth over his head much of the time. Also worth noting are Herbert Marshall as the police inspector, adding a measure of solemn dignity to the proceedings, and the great character actress Kathleen Freeman as the Delambre's housekeeper. Hedison's Andre, using himself to test the teleporter, finds himself merged with a housefly that was in the device, unnoticed, during the experiment. He then has the head and one arm of the fly, while the fly has the same from him. Andre finds his own identity slipping away in favor of the fly's. A desperate search begins to find the affected fly so that a second experiment, hopefully correcting the first, can take place. It would be easy for the film to become ludicrous at any point but it never does. It's all insanely convincing, including the now-famous ending, when the fly is finally found in a spider's web, about to be eaten, and a close-up shows us Andre's face, his expression a crazed look of pure terror as the spider approaches, his tiny voice screaming, Help me! Help me! To paraphrase Inspector Charas, who kills both fly and spider with a rock, it's an ending no moviegoer is likely to forget. 'The Fly' was a medium-budget film and it surprised everyone involved by becoming a huge hit, grossing over six times its cost. It went on to spawn two sequels and is rightly considered a classic of the genre, a first-rate example of horror cinema.

However, when he tries the technique on himself an unnoticed fly travels with him and the two bodies get horribly mixed up. Can he regain his humanity ?This is a good example of what makes many of the fifties creature-features so enjoyable and intriguing; on one level the story is completely nutty - a wife is beset with anguish when her husband turns into a six-foot fly - and yet it's played with such earnest sweet simplicity that it becomes touching, sad, dramatic, even philosophical. If you surrender to it, the suspension of disbelief in movies is a truly wonderful thing. If you don't, the movie can still be goofy fun. If you can't enjoy it on either level then see if you can purchase a personality somewhere. That said, the film is hardly perfect - it's a little stodgy in some places and the flashback main action takes a while to get going. Also, there's something about Owens I don't really buy - I think she's just a bit too perfect housewife and classic beauty for me. Compare her with the fabulous Geena Davis in the remake, for example. It's great to see old Vincent for once playing the good guy, and his dignified and tender performance really sells the crazy drama. Karl Struss' photography throughout is terrific and the classic reveal of the fly in all his gruesome glory is still one of the best popcorn-goes-flying moments in horror movies. Trivia - Hedison is credited as Al (his real name) here but shortly thereafter changed it to David, possibly to avoid association with this film; the irony is that this is easily his most famous and widely-screened role. Based on a short story by George Langelaan, and scripted by debut screenwriter James Clavell (The Great Escape, Shogun, etc). Followed by a predictable sequel, Return Of The Fly, in 1959, and remade brilliantly as a more mature and existential piece by David Cronenberg in 1986. Sadly, hard-working and talented B-movie director Neumann (Tarzan And The Leopard Woman, Rocketship X-M, many others) committed suicide shortly after helming this very successful minor classic.

Any kind of reaction could happen but I think one thing is for sure they never forget them. Anyway, The Fly is a terrific science fiction classic with a bizarre main plot. But what makes that this bizarre plot works in a perfect way is the great background story of love, fear and obsession. The film begins with the dead of Andre, apparently murdered by Helene (Patricia Owens), his own wife. The great and legendary Vincent Price is François Delambre, the brother of Andre, who doesn't believe that Helene murdered his brother even that she confess that. The way that the story is told is great showing with a long flashback the previous chapter in Andre and Helene's life and the truth about the dead of the first one. That story is also great with a man who is not afraid of any new technology having a big obsession with his new invention a device that can transport matter from one place to another. At the same time we have a woman who is worried about her husband's late behaviour and finally trying to save his life. Those scenes that I mentioned are, definitely, my favourites with an end that is just so damn brilliant. I shall never forget that scream as long as I live, said the Inspector Charas (Herbert Marshall) just after hearing the last lines of the white fly begging for help.The cast is really good but basically is pretty small with only three principals characters played in a great way by David Hedison, Patricia Owens and Vincent Price. I really love the simple makeup of the Fly-Man and the effects when Andre turns on his device are also good and quite funny, mostly because of the glasses that they must use.Finally, The Fly is just a nearly brilliant science fiction picture with a memorable and bizarre story about a hybrid that once it was human&#133; even as you and I (great tag-line by the way).

But since I saw it as a kid back in the late 50's when we couldn't even dream of what technology would do for movies, I can judge it considering what my reaction was back then.The first point is that I remember The Fly clearly and some scenes got stuck in mi mind ever since (when Patricia Owens pulls out David Hedison's head coverage, the huge fly's claw under the white coat, the final sequence with the spider's web). That leads to the second point I was terribly scared and impressed with the movie. And the conclusion is that it worked perfectly as the horror film it was supposed to be.I was also surprised that the great Vincent Price played a sympathetic role in a movie of this genre; but he adds quality to the product.A little classic in the genre. If you consider that The Fly gives the 80's remake starring Jeff Goldblum around 30 years of technological advantage, the original was better.Just for the record in Argentina The Fly was renamed as La mosca de la Cabeza Blanca (The Fly With the White Head).

The whole business of conservation of matter comes into play. Even if such a machine could be built, why did the exchange involve so much fly material and so little human. Remember, the parts were true to their original form. Forget that because that would ruin the movie. As it is, we have this poor man, Al Hedison (later David on Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea), who makes this wonderful machine for transporting matter (beam me up Scottie). He gets into it, not knowing there's a fly in there. What about the bacteria on the wall (this could have been called The Stroptococcus. Oh, well, the thing happens and we have two beings created. A little fly with a a man's head and fly's body, and a gigantic fly head with a man's body. The brain thing is a little confusing, although it is addressed in the fact that the giant fly man is slowly losing his wits. Of course, what must be done is to catch the fly and put the two entities back together. With their luck, they might have created a little man and a gigantic housefly. So much of the movie is about the despair of trying to get this to happen. Eventually, the wife is seen as a murderer for killing her husband in a giant machine press. He story is a little hard to swallow. That's why the final scene with Vincent Price looking down at the spider web is so important. She needs to get off the hook.Several viewers have pointed out that last scene. I, too, had nightmares when I first watched this at our little movie theater in 1958. That shrill whiny voice, the man with the little vocal chords who had aged as a fly would age, waiting for that enormous spider to suck out his bodily fluids--well, talk about your nightmares. It's sure a lot scarier than showing up at your graduation without any pants. I love these movies. If I sound disrespectful, I'm not. They were a part of my childhood. See this if you never have.

I felt the remake had zero subtlety or charm and was just a special effects-laden and grotesque movie. If you care, look for my review of this film to see just how much I hated it (and my hatred of this film is INTENSE). Probably so much of why I hated the disgusting remake was because the original film was everything the remake was not--it was charming, low budget, effective and campy fun.The film is about a scientist who has a basement lab. He's working on a device to teleport things from one place to another (kind of like a Star Trek transporter). It works great, but when he makes the trip himself, a fly buzzes into the chamber and the DNA of him and the fly become fused--producing a human-sized creature with a giant fly head and arm (it's so coooool when you finally see him without a sheet draped over his head, as he was during so much of the movie to avoid scaring his wife). Attempts to find the fly-sized creature with a human head and arm are totally unsuccessful, so eventual the fated scientist shoves himself into a press and squishes himself.The police suspect that this was just a murder, and they want to charge the scientist's wife. All looks bleak until the very final scene (one of the most memorable ones in screen history) when the detective hears a screaming fly calling for help--just before it is devoured by a spider. You see a little human head and hear him screeching in a high pitched voice HELP ME!. What a cool scene.The film also stars Vincent Price, who actually plays a normal person, not the bug-man. However, he does return for a sequel and you can guess what happens to Vincent in that one! This is great campy fun--a not to be missed film for horror movie fans.

I find it extremely boring. However, the scientific ideas presented in The Fly were very intriguing to me. Hell, I'll even go as far to say I was understanding and learning while watching in the film, and not in the hokey way. The science ideas are very clever and intensely interesting, and you can quote me on that. Yes&#133;me&#133;who hates science, that's right!--Another hard thing to do is to put a fly's head on a dude's body (and to a bigger extent, but a dude's head on a fly's body) and not make it laughable and silly. With the master craftsmen involved in The Fly, they pull it off making these things disturbing and genuinely frightening in parts. Bravo!--The characters in the film have to make some tough decisions, and I was intrigued to see what way they would go. The best example of this is the tough cookie that Helene (the wife character) has to face - does she kill the thing her husband has become because that is his will and he is now a monster? Or does she accept the monster and realise her husband needs to live, whatever the consequences? The aftermath of these decisions she makes is even more fascinating - her reactions both intriguing and surprising.--For it's day, The Fly had wonderful makeup and visual effects. I thought the artwork was impressive, the flyhead was pretty darn scary as was the humanfly. The artists managed to convey all the frightening things about insects and put it on a guy's head, well done them.--As well as giving us enthralling ideas about science, the film also portrays nicely the idea of obsession with science, and when good experiments go wrong, and that dabbling with unknown forces is never a good idea. These messages and concepts are never thrown right in our face, but played with in a subtle and clever manner that makes them even more thought-provoking.THE BAD--Though the effect is still there, I think the flyman could've had more screen-time. The story is all resolved rather quickly, I would've liked to have seen society's reaction to the creature, and how this drives him to want to die.--There are some off moments in the performances, particularly by Patricia Owens. She is good for the most part, but did come across as a little fake in some scenes (especially her crying). RATING9/10 - A compelling horror piece.

For the last 30 years, artists have ceased to be the heralds of culture. Where once Jack Kerouac, Elvis Presley and James Dean changed the way people acted and thought, now the Steve Jobs-types and the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world hold the influence. Instead of lines stretching across the street for the latest Beatles album, they're for the newest IPhone. In an increasingly tech-heavy world, one might come to the conclusion that we're more sophisticated than generations past. Steve Jobs certainly was, maybe even Zuckerberg, whose inventions didn't come out of mere computer know-how, but rather imagination and creativity the same things fueling cultural change in the past. The only difference, however, is that the IPhone or Facebook are not intellectually or emotionally stimulating things; they don't force one to see the world through another's eyes, or expand their knowledge, as a book, film or album would--the good ones, at least. In other words, there's no intellectual trickle-down. Therefore, the smartest people in the world get smarter--creating new devices, websites, apps--and as a result, the dumb people get dumber.Seeing as how The Fly is a modern retelling of Frankenstein, and thus ruminates on the double-edged sword of science, I found this particular review an apt catalyst for a small dose of my mad ranting on technology. I apologize.The Fly stars Patricia Owens as the wife of a mad scientist (David Hedison). As often happens with scientists of the mad variety, an experiment goes horribly wrong, resulting in the hideous splicing of atoms between the scientist and a fly.The ambassador of horror himself, Vincent Price, plays the brother of the scientist, but is essentially the embodiment of the audience, expressing our groans and shock.On the surface, this sounds like any other B-monster movie from the '50s, meant to horrify dimwitted teenagers with hollow thrills and grotesque imagery--we've come so far. On the contrary, the film deals with the growing cultural reliance on technology and the mad race to push science as far as possible, albeit coercively. The ideas behind the scares wouldn't mean much if the scares weren't scary, but they are. Watching the film through modern eyes, I can't help but feel like I've seen this before--The Twilight Zone, Star Trek, etc.--but even a strained concept can continue to affect if done well enough, as it is here. Maybe it's my illogical fear of spiders, but there's one specific scene that will take my head some time to shake. And while this is totally meaningless, I adored the design of the laboratory, with all the swirly, neon lights and spinning doohickeys. While The Fly isn't the scariest or smartest sci-fi horror film, its message holds up, and will continue to for some time. Beyond that, at a pure sensory level, the movie is tense and occasionally frightening, but more fun than anything. For those of us who like spinning doohickeys.

The final shot in this movie is so legendary that it has been shown repeatedly in horror movie countdowns and anthologies and imitated in pop culture. As time travels on, though, and the younger generations get further removed from this decade, I find that a lot of my horror fan brethren have never seen the original, other than that final shot, or are much more familiar with Cronenberg's remake (which is also excellent), but this is shame because this movie is a gem that needs to be seen and appreciated.The movie starts off at the finale, with our hero being killed by his wife. The police start investigating what could cause this housewife to snap and murder her husband and, so, the majority of the movie plays in flashback as the events leading up to this death are revealed. This opening kill scene is very notable for the amount of bright red blood that is poured all over the press in which our hero dies. The film is a contemporary of the beginning of Hammer horror and much like those movies would have shocked audiences at the time. Horror films were just starting to be created in color, really, and no one showed this amount of blood. Yes, it seems tame compared to what we see on crime TV nowadays, but it was an important step in horror evolution to show gore like this.It seems our scientist hero has developed a way to teleport matter. One of the things that stands out so much is how likable that scientist is in this movie. Most of the mad scientists in horror history were unstable, or just plain maniacal, but David Hedison, as our hero, is nice guy who may not spend as much time with his family as he should, but it's clear he's devoted to them. His wife is, for most intents, the main character of the movie and it is through her eyes that the viewer sees the events unfold. Patricia Owens plays this character with a great amount of talent. She is loving and devoted when needed, but plays concerned, to stressed out and finally a woman on the verge of collapse, until she must carry out her husband's final wishes, leading to another shade of emotion where we get to see her emotional detachment (which may or may not be a ploy). The other great actor in this movie is, of course, Vincent Price. He plays the scientist's brother, secretly in love with his sister- in-law, but a man who loves his family. It's a refreshing role for Price as he does not play the hammy villain in this one, but rather the straight man trying to put together the pieces of the scientific mystery.Back to our experiments, which are bound to go wrong. Surely any fan of pop culture knows the twist, in which our hero's particles are mixed with those of a house fly, causing a monstrous mutation. At first, we see only the scientist shrouded in hood to keep his secret hidden, but slowly the director reveals more of the mutation, until a stunning reveal shot, complete with fly's eye camera shot. I can't imagine to know what this shot would have been to a 50s audience, but it still stands up today and is one of the best moments in the film. From here, the movie revolves around finding the fly that caused this mess so they can attempt to undo the accident, until we finally get to the tragedy that begins the movie. This movie should never lose its' place in history and should be required viewing for anyone claiming to be a student of horror history. It earned its' p;ace in the horror pantheon.

The concept is also original, clever, fascinating and within the context of the narrative is utterly plausible - particularly with reference to how the accident occurred which just shows that even a basic mistake can have devastating consequences. Even when the 'accident' happens to Andre, Neumann and co continue to hold the audience's attention by maintaining a strong narrative which is guaranteed to keep your interest right till the end. The moment when Andre is 'unmasked' is also gave me a bit of a jump which is weird because it still made me jump even though I knew what to expect. It's hard to explain, but if you've seen the film you'll know what I mean.The science behind it all is utterly fascinating and ingenious - although I suspect you'd have to have a 'Stephen Hawking' type IQ to be able to understand it all, but you know what it really doesn't matter because there is plenty going on in this film to guarantee that your interest will never wane.The Fly is a brilliant film that still holds up well over 50 years later.

It's also got a nice slow pace, allowing the audience to take in the fairly heavy and serious ideas the film presents. Finally the film has significant emotional weight, particularly in its third act. It honestly gets quite heavy and asks some evocative questions at this point in the film.Aside from the films dramatic pursuits, it also functions as a solid sci-fi film with a horror edge. The set design is excellent, specifically the lab set, and there are some creepy ideas on display. I would argue that the film shouldn't really apply as a true horror (it rarely even tries to scare the audience), however it succeeds in presenting some sinister visuals on occasion. Overall I feel the producers mistook the film's intentions.

Why was sequels in the old days before Star Wars giving smaller Budgets?   <div class=yn id=ynd_1366523>  <form method=get    action=/register/login  > Was the above review useful to you?   <input class=click linkasbutton-secondary type=submit   name=ynb_1366523_yes value=Yes    rel=login   > <input class=click linkasbutton-secondary type=submit  name=ynb_1366523_no value=No   rel=login   >  </form>  </div>  <hr noshade=1 size=1 width=50% align=center>  <div> <small>1 out of 2 people found the following review useful</small> <a href=/user/ur9938570/><img class=avatar src=http//ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4NzUwMzg5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE1MTc3OQ@@._V1._SX40_SY40_SS40_.jpg height=$avatar.image.size width=$avatar.image.size></a> <h2>The Fly</h2> <img width=102 height=12 alt=8/10 src=http//i.media-imdb.com/images/showtimes/80.gif> Author <a href=/user/ur9938570/>Scarecrow-88</a> <small>from United States</small> <small>16 April 2009</small> "},{"Title":"The Fly","Date":"16 April 2009","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""},{"Title":"Excellent piece of 50's horror/sci-fi.","Date":"30 April 2008","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""},{"Title":"THE FLY (Kurt Neumann, 1958) ***","Date":"11 October 2007","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""},{"Title":"The Fly vs The Fly","Date":"26 March 2007","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""},{"Title":"As God is my Witness, I Saw The THING!","Date":"29 May 2006","Score":"5 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""},{"Title":"A not so mad scientist","Date":"4 October 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""},{"Title":"Vincent Price at his best...","Date":"23 March 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""},{"Title":"I never thought it could happen to me...","Date":"8 January 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":""}{"Title":"Well Written, if a bit cheesy, early horror","Date":"21 August 2014","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi","Review":" To start off, I have not seen David Cronenberg's remake, since I wanted to watch the original first. I was pleasantly surprised at the sophistication of the writing of The Fly, and since the horror comes from the script, it seems to have aged fairly well. The story is reminiscent of Kafka's The Metamorphosis and Shelley's Frankenstein. I especially liked how the story starts off as a murder mystery. After the opening credits, a man discovers a gruesome corpse whose head has been smashed by a hydraulic press, which must have been pretty shocking for the 1958 audience. After the wife of the deceased confesses to killing her husband, she recounts the strange events that lead up to it. I found this intriguing, but there were some problems. The acting is somewhat sub par, but the main problem is the ending. The little 'fly voice' was pretty cheesy, and the little fly human hybrid was even cheesier. I think a better ending would have been to have the wife taken to the asylum, no one else seeing the white headed fly, and then for the final shot to have been the fly moving on a tree trunk or something like that. This would have kept up the ambiguity of the truth of the wife's story.

The acting was - shall we say - subdued, and could perhaps be described as stilted in places - and Patricia Owens especially seemed strangely distant as Helene, the wife of scientist Andre, played by David Hedison (although he's credited here as Al Hedison.) Vincent Price was solid enough as Andre's brother Francois, but again unspectacular. The movie gets off to a strong start with the surprisingly bloody (for the era) discovery of Andre's body crushed in a factory and his hysterical wife Helene claiming that she killed him. The story she relates to explain what happened revolves around Andre's invention of a teleporter that can transport matter from one place to another. Like all good mad scientists, he chooses to experiment on himself, accidentally sending himself through the teleporter along with a housefly, whose atoms intermingle with his, producing two grotesque creatures - a human with a fly's head, and a fly with a human's head. The movie does touch somewhat effectively on an issue that's very real - at what price progress? - but the real strength of the movie are the creatures. Andre with the fly's head is grotesque and yet entirely sympathetic at the same time, while the fly with Andre's head is a pitiful creature as it's seen near the end of the movie trapped in a spider's web and about to be devoured while it cries out in a whiny voice help me! help me! These are memorable creatures, and the scenes they're in are memorable scenes, somewhat making up for the strangely wooden performances.As an aside, I can think of one other reason this film is memorable aside from Mountie films, it may be the only U.S. made film that's intended for an American audience that's set entirely in Canada - the story here taking place in Montreal.

I had a friend who ran out of the theater when the fly was unmasked. David Hedison is a scientist who invents a matter teleporter machine. During a test with himself as the matter a housefly buzzes unnoticed into the machine and during the teleportation process the fly and human atoms get mixed up. The unmasking of the fly is fun and the idea of the film is interesting but the film has some problems. I don't know why Vincent Price is in this movie as a member of the family but he really seems out of place from the Roger Corman flicks such as the Pit and the Pendulum he made his name in. The last scene apparently required many takes because Price and Hebert Marshall couldn't stop laughing. The Fly was remade in a much more grisly manner by David Cronenberg in 1986.

It's a film with one of the great horror premises &#x96; a scientist (Al Hedison) creates a teleportation device and is accidentally melded with a fly when the insect gets into the disintegrator booth during a test &#x96; but it plods through its plot with little impact.The movie spends a lot of time tip-toeing around what we know must have happened, so Hedison spends a lot of the movie with a sheet on his head, and when the horror is revealed the effect has not aged well at all. Much of the story is told in flashback, and too much of the pre-flashback set up is repeated later to boring effect. Like the sequels, this is hardly a terrible film but boy is it dull.

I never did see David Cronenberg's remake except for a few snippets, but those snippets convinced me that Cronenberg was following his usual impulse to make the viewer's skin crawl. Some of us don't really need that. If we want our skins to crawl all we have to do is get out of bed in the morning. (I'll except Cronenberg's Dead Ringers from those generalization, a truly spooky movie without a pander in it.) As the original, this 1959 version stands tall. They actually seem to have intended to make a horror/science fiction movie rather than a comedy, and yet they've achieved both.It's a horrifying story of a Montreal scientist, Al Hedison, who invents a teleportation machine that deconstructs objects and sends their elements at the speed of light to a glass box where they are reassembled in their original form. Even the champagne retains its chill. There are, of course, always a few small problems to be ironed out. The printing on a cheap ash tray comes out backward. The pet cat, Dandelot, gets lost somewhere between the transmitter and the receiver. Where is she now? asks the desperate wife, Patricia Owens. Somewhere out in space. A stream of cat atoms, Hedison replies wonderingly. The fact that Dandelot has been thoroughly disassembled doesn't stop her atomic stream from going MEOWWW as it sails off into the ether. (I warned you this was funny.) The general idea is that there are some things man was never meant to know. This used to be called hubris. The story of blundering into the unknown and coming up with unexpected consequences seems to have been especially common in the 19th century when theology was coming to grips with scientific breakthroughs like Darwinism. The theme had a resurgence in the SF movies of the 1950s, following the atomic bomb but Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus is still the holotype.The movie resonates with all sorts of familiar ideas and images. When Hedison's teleporter transmits the words Made in Japan backwards, he wordlessly walks away from his wife to sit at his desk and work on the problem. Just when they were planning a romantic evening together too. Hedison was never more than just half a man from the beginning. At any rate the scene reminded me of the opening of James Joyce's Ulysses, when the atheist Buck Mulligan mocks the Catholic mass by intoning ritualistic mumbo jumbo over his bowl of shaving cream, claiming he's transforming it into the body and blood of the Savior. Looking down puzzled at the untransformed shaving cream, he says, Oops. A bit of trouble with those white corpuscles. Hedison has the head and one arm of a fly, and the fly part is slowly fighting the rest of him for dominance. At one point he's trying to type a note to his wife with his human hand and the fly hand grasps the other's wrist and begins struggling with it, and all we can see is Dr. Strangelove and his gloved hand, which insists on saluting Hitler and strangling its owner.It is, however, a reasonably well-done, if not exactly expert, horror film. We want Hedison to get himself together again but his supporters can never seem to find that fly with the white head. At the end, after Hedison is safely cleaned and pressed, his brother (Vincent Price) and the skeptical police inspector (Herbert Marshall) stumble upon the fly with Hedison's head and arm. The thing is caught in a web and about to be eaten by a spider. HELP ME! HELP ME! it cries in a terrified yet comically tinny voice before Marshall comes unglued and smashes spider and fly with a rock. This scene, with Price and Marshall bent over, peering at the fly in the web, was subject to innumerable retakes because the two actors kept cracking up with laughter and ruining the shot. It really IS kind of funny.

Future character actor David Hedison (credited here as Al Hedison) is Andre Delambre, a brilliant scientist whose teleportation device promises to change the world. Instead, it morphs him into a half man, half fly creature when one of the annoying insects is accidentally teleported with him.Unfortunately, the film doesn't do this great concept justice. The creature spends too much time sulking in the basement when it could be on a terrifying rampage (as any fan of good horror would expect!). Moreover, the film focuses too much on the family's reaction to the man fly -- sometimes giving it the feel of one of those serious episodes of a family sitcom -- and their desperate quest to find the fly in question so the two sets of atoms can be unmeshed. And the climax? It's deliberately hokey.Still, if one goes in with the right expectations, The Fly can be enjoyable enough and, if you're in the right mood, good for a few unintentional laughs. The film was followed one year later by a superior sequel, Return of the Fly.

It's not until the final act that anything really approaching horror is documented even though that is exceptionally fun stuff with the slow-burn of his change and the glimpses demented appearance generating some fun before he goes crazy and the finale which is still outright classic material.

At first the wife won't tell the motive behind the killing but she eventually opens up about an experiment he was working on that went horribly wrong and crossed parts of his body, including his head, with that of a fly. It's funny but this is a film I didn't care too much for as a child but this latest viewing, my first in over a decade, really had me entertained and caught up in the story, which is a lot more of a thinking man's drama than all out monster movie. I think the film works so well because it's easy to get caught up in the personal drama of a wife desperately trying to save her husband from a horrible fate that gets worse and worse with each passing moment. I think the film does a great job in the opening segment at building up the suspense of what led up to the murder. When the flashbacks start up we're already drawn into the story and we actually care as to what happens and how it plays out. Hedison is very good in his moments at playing the husband but he's even better when it comes time for him to act without words and his face hidden under a wrap. Owens is also very good in her role even thought here are a few moments where she goes a tad bit over the top. Price is great as usual and Herbert Marshall does a very good job in the role of the Inspector. The special effects in the film aren't anything overly ground breaking but they're effective for what they are. The sound effects are another major plus especially one scene with a cat's meow. Then, of course, we have that legendary ending which has to be one of the greatest in film history.

Basically, François Delambre (Price) is called late by his sister-in-law Helene Delambre (Patricia Owens), who appears to have murdered her husband Andre (Licence to Kill's David Hedison). His head and left hand were crushed in a plant press, and François and his acquaintance Insp. Charas (Herbert Marshall) need to know why she did it, and so begins a flashback as Helene tells them what happened. In the flashback, Andre had invented a scientific breakthrough, creating a teleporter that disintegrate and reintegrates things from one place to another. He was perfecting the machine to not only send objects without alternations, but living things, and of course it was when he tried to do it to himself that things went wrong. He managed to transport himself, and a common house fly, and the machine of course got confused, and replaced his head and left hand with that of the fly. Covered up and unable to speak, he types on the typewriter and tells his wife that they need to find the fly, recognisable with a white head and white leg, to turn him back to normal. Of course when Helene, son Philippe (Charles Herbert) and maid Emma (Kathleen Freeman) fail to catch it, and Andre's hideous face is revealed, he gives up completely, and sees no choice but to destroy the machine, and have Helene destroy him, which explains the murder. Returning to the present time, all believe Helene is mad, and Insp. Charas will only be convinced if François can find the recognisable fly, and when they do, it is too late, the human headed screaming fly is eaten by a spider (disturbing to watch) and crushed by a rock. Also starring Betty Lou Gerson as Nurse Andersone, Eugene Borden as Dr. Ejoute and Torben Meyer as Gaston. Obviously this classic doesn't compare to the special effects ladened remake from David Cronenberg, but the original does have enough moments and almost as much tension to keep you gripped, and of course the famous squeaky voiced shrieking Help me!, a watchable classic horror.

They filmed it in color, so guess what, there's lots of gratuitous color in most shots. They overplayed the meager special effects of the mad scientist laboratory, showing again and again those jazzy multi-colored neon lights. Most of the dialog will put you in a permanent state of snooze. And its Leave It To Beaver family life will have you moaning in disbelief. Montreal? Don't make me laugh. Okay, you made me laugh. Sure it had some scary moments and a few bizarre ones (why do you think I gave it a four instead of a one?).

Cronenberg clearly saw a potential outlet to explore some of his favorite themes (the grotesque transformation of the body through technology/science), emphasized by Chris Walas' impressive makeup FX and impassioned, tragic performances by then-lovers Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis; clearly, Cronenberg saw areas in which he could improve on the original, and was successful. Neumann's The Fly is a dated venture--the type of film where the scientist and his lover make endless allusions to science and God--which takes good production values (evidenced in the Hammer-esquire sets, costumes, and cinematography), a fun performance by Vincent Price (who isn't on-screen enough), and a relatively impressive transformation (though it is deliberately padded out to a big 'reveal' moment). While the film has its lulls (in the first half hour especially), and certain plot elements are glaringly obvious even if you have no prior knowledge of the story, this Fly makes for a passable creature feature...even though Cronenberg's version kicks it to the curb.

Most sci-fi films of that period, including this one, have such primitive special effects that they destroy any credibility of presenting a scary story. In this particular film, the main drawback is not the dated effects but the sheer boredom of the story. It's too slow. A fly moves a lot faster than this flick.One odd thing about the cast. The two stars of the film were no-names (Al Hedison and Patricia Owens) and the two supporting cast members were big names (Vincent Price and Herbert Marshall).One plus for the film that you certainly didn't see in the re-make is they give God His due realizing that human beings are not supposed to play God and they state just that.
