[{"Title":"Excellent!!! A cut above, WAY above, most other teen movies!","Date":"5 March 2002","Score":"35 out of 40 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  Crazy/beautiful is a wonderful movie. It is really far better than most teen movies. When I saw the trailers and TV spots for the movie last year, I was unimpressed. The impression I got was that the movie was another one of those teen jobs wherein the director and the actors all take themselves WAY too seriously! Kind of like a Charlie Sheen movie, back when he was having all those ego problems. (Sheen is much recovered, and much over himself now. He's a charming fellow these days, and a great talent.)I bought the DVD the other day, and am very happy that I did. I should have trusted that a talent such as Kirsten Dunst would not have placed herself in tripe. Sorry! This movie is thoughtfully written, sensitively acted, and very well directed and cut. I am not a teenager anymore (far away from it, in fact), so I am not impressed by hipness, hormonal chic, nor teen cool. Thus I was very pleasantly surprised to discover that crazy/beautiful is rich, touching, engaging, moving, uplifting, and extremely entertaining. Yaay!Hey Buena Vista marketing people--- please note that the movie you seemed to have presented via your trailers and such last year looked like crap! And yet the real movie, the one Kirsten and Whatshisname made, is sweet and marvelous!!! I know you marketing folks meant well, and all marketing is some form of experiment, but perhaps you can learn from this that the audiences needn't be sold cliched garbage to go see a film. In fact, the apparent cliches presented in the trailers kept me away. Thank goodness for DVD!Finally--- the DVD is also great. The making of segment is amazing, and worthy of it's own venue. The director's commentary with Dunst is also intriguing. It all adds to our enjoyment of the movie. Thanks, guys!

What looks like the set-up of a cliché-filled storyline on the outside -- high-schoolers Dunst as the troubled daughter of a U.S. Senator, and Hernandez as the intelligent inner-city kid meet up and fall in love -- takes on a fresh twist (and fresh is a good thing -- especially in film today). With the dialogue seeming mostly improvisational, the romance is impressively convincing. Dunst is already familiar to film audiences -- making great strides at a very young age with Vampire -- but this could arguably be her finest turn. You do feel something for her character, as screwed up as she can be. But even screwed up people need love, too, and you do want her to succeed. And good performances apparently rubbed off on Hernandez as well, giving sensational insight into a conflicted character torn between duty to family and education versus his love for Dunst. The story does take a turn for the... well... crazy near the end but recovers nicely -- and without being too preachy or schmaltzy. Don't expect greatness, but don't be shocked if you like it.

The thing about teenage movies is that the really good ones don't placate exclusively to the age bracket of which the film is about.  Crazy/Beautiful focuses on the teenagers, but shows the flavors of the leads' respective cultures, and how they are able to combine both their intellect and emotions to overcome some very superficial barriers, which create profound rifts among human society.The overall theme vascillates by placing the ball into each of the leads court at various points in the film.  This makes for some interesting interaction which, in the real world, I've personally observed.  On this score the film is rather accurate.The film gets a touch melodramatic at points, and there's no one actor to really single out as all the leads have their moment of high energy at various points in the film.The film itself, because of the subject material, is somewhat lethargic, but does keep one's interest in its presentation.A definate thumbs up for a night's rental.

Nicole and Carlos hit it off in spite of Carlos's reservations about the wild (crazy/beautiful) Nicole. He's from a poor family and keen to do well at his studies. She's on a path of self destruction, at least academically, probably physically. Carlos hopes to go to the navy academy and become a pilot. 	Now this sounds fairly ho hum but is brought successfully to the screen by very strong acting performances from both Dunst and Hernandez and also by Bruce Davison who plays Nicole's Dad Tom. 	These characters are flawed and therefore interesting. The film is mindful of how complicated real people are. 	Nicole is a carouser, drunk or stoned most of the time. Jay is level headed but becomes overwhelmed by Nicole. Dad certainly doesn't think he has all of the answers.	Crazy/Beautiful is inspired a little by the inter racial aspect of the relationship but much more by the veracity of the performances.4 Crazy Flys Out Of Five  "},{"Title":"Surprised me","Date":"3 January 2005","Score":"22 out of 22 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" I caught five minutes of this then decided to watch more of it and I was pleasantly surprised at what a superb actress Kirsten Dunst is! She is so natural and at ease in front of a camera. The chemistry between her and the boyfriend is the best you will ever see and that's why I watched this movie. I felt like I was eavesdropping in on two young teenagers throughout the whole movie. The story is very simple and just chronicles the life of these two high-schoolers who fall in love by pure chance (the romance is instigated by Dunst and she does a great job). I think everyone will be able to relate to the characters and story in this movie. These are real-life characters and they are not overly stereotyped which was surprising, as well. The leading actor did a fantastic job, too. There is zero shock value thrown into this movie to try and put you on the edge of your seat which is something you don't find in Hollywood movies and which was really nice. Mostly every scene involves Kirsten and her boyfriend and they pull it off. There aren't many actors that can say that they can do that. This movie is entertaining throughout and will keep your attention. Already I like Kirsten more than I ever liked Julia Roberts, Gwyneth Paltrow, Daryl Hannah, Winona Ryder, Chistine Ricci, Catherine Zeta Jones, Kate Winslet, Sharon Stone, or any of these younger female celebrities. The direction in this movie is very good. If you want a real nice relaxing evening and you don't want to watch something with a lot of hype, drama, violence, stereotypes, people pitting each other against one another, etc. then I recommend this movie. I will definitely look for more of Kirsten in the future.

I live in Jersey City, so I personally can't relate to these teen flicks involving blonde airheads and guys who look like they just jumped off the pages of Tiger Beat.In Crazy/Beautiful one of the main characters is a Hispanic--played beautifully by Jay Hernandez who I hope to see in more and more movies--which I CAN relate to.  Most of the friends I know are of Hispanic origin, and it's very rare that you see a Hispanic as a lead in a film like this.  And Jay's Hispanic character wasn't used merely as a tool in creating melodrama in a preachy West Side Story manner.Kirsten Dunst pretty much gives the best performance of her career.  I like how they didn't put much makeup on her face, giving her a much more real look.  I think Kirsten is one of the most beautiful young actresses in the biz, so I think she's beautiful no matter how little makeup she wears.  So I'm not going to say it was a plus that they made her look ugly.  She didn't look ugly, but at the same time she looked like a real teenage girl and it added to her character.Bruce Davison has a great supporting role as Kirsten's father.  Of course, in all teen movies, they feel it's needed to add a top-class, veteran actor to the cast to give it a touch of class.  Well, that's one cliche of teen movies that I don't mind and Bruce was great, proving himself as one of our great, underrated actors.I like how Jay's character is never really discriminated against by Kirsten's white-collar Dad--who's a Congressman.  None of this You're dating a man of another race??? or You're dating a man of low-class crap. The film skips through all that, being that Jay is a well-to-do individual who has his head up high and wants to become a pilot.  The Dad has nothing against that, in fact he wants to help him out, setting him up with an interview and everything.  But he doesn't want him to see his daughter, because of the way she is.  I don't want to give anything away, so I won't reveal what exactly her problem is.  So I thought that was a good way of flipping this sub-genre on its head.  Usually it's the father who doesn't want the daughter to date the guy, because he doesn't like who she's dating. In this case, he didn't want the two of them to go together, because he's concerned about the boyfriend.I only have a few problems with this film.  First off, you never really get the feeling that Kirsten has a severe problem between the beginning and end. So it feels like her disorder was used strictly as a dramatic tool. Through most of the film, she's amazingly jovial.  We see her drinking once in a while, but let's face it--what teen doesn't?  And I thought--especially for a PG-13 film--they went overboard with the sex scenes.  I'm not saying that they were explicit, but there was a good deal of them.  I was thinking, as watching certain portions of the film, what my Dad said  The love in most romantic movies nowadays seems to be based more on sex than love. Don't get me wrong, we do get a feel of the love--not lust--between Jay and Kirsten, but they could've trimmed the sex just a bit.  It just came off in the wrong way.For those looking for an escape from most of the lame teen flicks that have been fed to us in previous years, I recommend you check this one out. It's a shame that this movie didn't reach a big audience in theaters.  I really hope more people will go out and rent this film, because it's very good.My score  7 (out of 10)   "},{"Title":"It touches the heart.

Both are great in their roles and their love story in the movie is believable and realistic. Their cultural difference are nicely shown in the movie but their social class difference is perhaps a bit underdeveloped and underused. They could had done some nice things with this story element, so it's a bit of a missed opportunity for the movie.The story is nicely told and the stereotypical elements of a romantic teen movie are as much as possible avoided. It succeeds most of the time in this and because of that the movie is better than the average romantic teen comedy.It's a perfectly watchable movie mainly targeted towards teens, however also different age groups should be able to appreciate this movie and its love story.

It wasn't the usual dumb teen movie. It address some real-world issues from a modern perspective and managed to not make itself look silly doing it. The script was tightly written with just enough edge to give it a sense of reality without it being totally destroyed by it's kiddie rating.The usual teen movie makes fun of the adult world and laughably tries to make the teens somehow the center of the known universe. This is more real in it's approach, showing two very vulnerable young people on the verge of being thrust into that very real adult world and the issues they have in discovering themselves as near-adults through each other's eyes. There are quite a few relationships these days that mix cultures and this film handles a realistic look at some of the problems. I think it had to or risk the charge of being unrealistic. Still, there is more here, not just teen romance, though that is certainly painfully portrayed by an emotionally exposed Kirsten Dunst and the serious Jay Hernandez. It is also a film ultimately about the good and evil influences that tug at us all and the effects it can have on those around us. It managed to convey those issues fairly well given the censorship restraints it was under. Adding to a solid performance by Dunst and Hernandez is a fine cast, including Bruce Davidson and a deliciously unlikable Lucinda Jenney doing a great modern take on the evil stepmother. Taryn Manning as Dunst's best girlfriend nearly stole a couple of scenes and certainly bears watching in the future; there's light behind those big eyes. I see she also had a minor credit in the music score, which was very entertaining on it's own (and this said from an old guy). I also enjoyed the performance of Rolando Molina as Hernandez's brother, though it was nearly too stereotyped. He managed to make it just believable enough to be genuine. My major criticism would be the lack of subtitles for the considerable Spanish dialog. I for one found this too frustrating to forgive.All-in-all, it's more than worth the price of admission and I can agree with some other viewers that Dunst might deserve at least a nomination come awards time next year.

The young girls in this movie is fighting with herself for her future. She is having problems with life. I think she is too good, so she can barely take what's happening around her. Although she isn't living a bad life in a bad neighbourhood. But how the teenagers are, they are rebellious, but she isn't stupid. She isn't after boys and she can see things much more clearly. Her mother is dead, so she has a reason to be how she is, she hasn't got over it. And her father is very concerned about her.She want's to escape from everything by drinking and smoking weed (like 50% of teenagers)and fooling around and playing with people. She isn't concerned about what others are thinking about her, some are thinking that she is cold and doesn't care about anything, but that's a facade.It is the kind of movie, where you don't expect a happy end, but hope for it, and you will be positively surprised.My favourite scenes are the ones, where she is photographing. She was making so beautiful photos. It seemed like those photos where having so much heart, they seemed warm and cosy.

I don't run to see a movie of hers just because...I pick out movies, that have spirit. And she is a talent in picking out movies. You should only see the list of her movies. Well, not all of them are my type of movies, but the most are. Little Women was my favourite cartoon, when I was a child. I watched the movie actually because of Claire Danes. She is also an original and has been one of my favourite actresses many years. Now Kirsten is in that category too. She is so talented and beautiful. I would say she is a deep person. And she really touched my heart. She is exactly the type of people I like personally. She brings joy to life. Not many people can be so positive.

In classic fashion, she blames everyone else for all her problems, is completely irresponsible and turns on a dime against those who are out of favor (her doting dad, for example).The portrayal of enabling isn't bad either. Good boy falls in love with exciting addict. However, in the real world he would have enabled her to her grave. In the absence of the boyfriend, her completely unaware father would have insured she died from her disease. The key problem with the ending--which ruins the movie for the addiction-aware--is that she doesn't die OR get sober. In terms of pure fantasy, the movie ranks with The Thin Man series, in which caring, considerate and competent alcoholic PI Nick Charles is never nasty--yeah, right--and Lost Weekend, in which writer Don Birnam easily gets sober at the end. Sorry, that just doesn't happen.While the movie clearly shows that an excellent upbringing is no impediment to alcoholism, it implies that poor behaviors cause alcoholic drinking. As I have written in four books on the subject and repeatedly point out in my free on-line addiction report, this is one of the great myths of addiction that serves only to perpetuate the disease. The movie's ending can easily cause the uninitiated to believe that love and working with the addict gets her sober. Every recovering addict alive with at least five years' sobriety will admit that what got them sober was uncompromising tough love and that getting sober was essential for a return to civilized behaviors.If the movie had shown Kirsten's character going into rehab and coming out clean, I might have rated the movie a five. But that would have required either dad or nice boyfriend setting proper boundaries and offering uncompromising tough love--in which case I might have rated the movie a seven. Sorry, but all those comments about realistic portrayal, slight substance abuse problem, what teen doesn't drink? and the talk between dad and daughter at the end of the movie is utterly believable are written by viewers who don't have a clue about addiction. And because of a fatally flawed ending, Crazy/Beautiful fails to shed light on the most destructive disease known to man.

I can name probably ten other teen movies that are more horrible than this one. Especially since here the emotional drivel didn't reach the sappy levels the story and theme allowed for, which was good. But still this is not a good movie. It's just too bland and uninteresting. I don't really know what in this movie we were supposed to care about. The distracted A-student from the hood is not a terribly interesting character (also a character that's been done about a thousand times in different shapes and colors). The spoiled rich girl with emotional problems is an equally worn-out cliché. It just doesn't have anything that creates interest or sympathy.Sometimes i ask myself which is worse; the movie that is so bad that i hate it, or the movie that's so bland i don't care.

The father-daughter relationship portrayed in Crazy Beautiful struck me as pretty authentic the dad, distracted by his new wife and baby, constantly takes the wife's side in her battles with his daughter, and blames his daughter for just about everything. Not only does she not get Dad's attention, she gets his blame. The whole thing felt completely real.So the two main characters are from different classes, but given their relatively young age, it doesn't impede their love. Love and realizing that that love can make them whole is tantalizingly palpable in Crazy Beautiful and overrides everything. It, not class, is the point. I could believe that years from now, they would be each other's strength. They were meant to be together.And yet&#133;.the happy ending was pursued with a uniquely American zeal. A zeal for neat and tidy endings. All the complications that had spilled out so beautifully had to be swept up into orderly piles so that Dad no longer resented ANYthing, and for her family it was smooth sailing from here on out. How Carlos's mother felt about the crazy American girl, I guess is completely inconsequential.

Dunst is the spoiled drunken troublesome daughter of a California Congressman, who ends up being tamed by our hero, Jay Hernandez; a clean cut Latino living in East LA who has enough clarity of vision to keep himself on track and reform Dunst in the process. The plot made sense and you really find yourself rooting for the couple, in spite of several setbacks (brought on mainly by Dunst's character.) The only plot line that didn't make sense was Dunst's Congressman father's effort to convince Hernandez to stop dating his daughter (fearing that she would wreck Hernandez's life.)

I wasn't that into this one though. Crazy Beautiful was a movie that I thought I'd like a lot more then I did, although I concede it was a very well made movie in a lot of ways.The advantage it has over other teen movies is the characters. They are well developed and real to the point you feel like you've met them. I really enjoyed that element and for That alone I'd give it at least a 6. Many of these types of movies feel so contrived. This one Didn't. There really weren't many false notes here, and Dunst plays the tough/fragile Nicki as so real, human and lovable that it's easy to get caught up and want everything to come out OK.Despite all that, I didn't like this all that much. One reason is that the movie, while sometimes focused on dialog and character development also seemed way to focused on Kirsten Dunst's feet, her stomach and her kissing scenes with Jay Hernandez. And I didn't feel that these two incredibly talented, REALLY talented performers, Dunst and Hernandez-Had ANY chemistry together. The movie seemed enthralled with them to the point where almost nothing was left to the imagination. Every kiss, every (allowable to be shown) body part, every toe and foot....was focused on. I mean the movie sometimes seemed to be more concerned with showing them as a couple then the plot itself and I started to lose interest after awhile. The chemistry factor was way down and very little was left to subtlety and the imagination.I also frankly was at times a little bored. While the people were relateable, the movie didn't reach out and grab me, though Nicole-particularly the relationship Between Nicole and her father, did.And that brings me to the best scene in the movie. The one between Nicole and her dad at the end where they talk and begin to repair their relationship. That was moving, powerful and completely and utterly believable. At that point the movie was pure perfection and I cried my eyes out! Nicole and her father's relationship had been developed enough that this was completely credible. That scene was a perfect 10.So crazy beautiful had it's positives and negatives like most movies. Although I probably would not watch it again and think I probably would have enjoyed it more at another time in my life, I'm glad I got to see it and the performances were all great.

Crazy/Beautiful discusses many themes that teenage romances won't touch such as safe sex, mental trauma, realistic social differences as well as racial differences without being racist. By that last comment I mean the film looks upon it as a positive difference, this is shown when Nicole compares her skin to Carlos' after sex.Kirsten Dunst surprised me with her acting, I've seen many of her films and I didn't know how she would portray Nicole. I wasn't disappointed, she showed how her behaviour increased erratically while keeping a constant character of the rebellious teenager. Jay Hernandez also surprised me on my second viewing when I realized his acting suited his character perfectly. Carlos is not clever over the top brainiac, he is quiet and well behaved. His awkwardness when Nicole is crying after the party is perfect for that scene as it shows the conflict between helping and not helping Nicole. Overall my only criticism of this film is that it was cut to reach one rating when I believe that being R rated would have made it a complete teenage drama that breaks all boundaries. Anyone who has been in a relationship where both of you are so extremely different you have nearly nothing in common but minor things will realize how someone as crazy as Nicole and someone as beautiful as Carlos can save each other.

I can identify with Dunst's character -- to a certain extent I can't, because my dad was a blue collar worker and my mom is still very well alive. But I was a good kid and straight-A student who, because of a series of family tragedies during my early teen years, did bad things in high school - like Nicole, mostly a lot of drinking and sex -- and I had a bad reputation for a few years and hung out with the wrong people (the real delinquents), as well as the class leaders (who weren't as clean-cut as you might think).  So I could identify with Nicole, with not *really* being a delinquent, but acting like one part-time (and I've gone on to get graduate degrees and become a professor, despite my behavior in high school, as I suspect she will clean up her act and go on to have the life her mother would have wanted her to have).And if I had met a hunk like Carlos -- isn't she lucky?  Jay Hernandez was pretty hot in this movie.  He did come across as closer to college age than high school age, but children of immigrants also seem more mature than average American teens anyhow, since, like Carlos, they often have some issues to deal with.  I like it that he was clean-cut, hard-working, and on the right track.  Not all immigrants or teenagers are future prisoners or drive-by victims.  In fact, I think that more immigrant teens are hardworking because they have come here to make the American dream.  So his character worked for me.Her father was an interesting character.  I like it that he wasn't a stereotypical white-bread know-nothing dad, that he understood his daughter's pain, but also, as he says to Carlos, has had to come to grips with his daughter's behavioral problems.  I understand how he wanted to shield Carlos from Nicole -- even Gandhi has said that chances are you will not bring people up to your level, they will bring you down to their's (in his Autobiography).  That Carlos really loves Nicole enough to want to stay with her -- so many people have commented negatively on the Hollywood happy ending of this story, but since I have been on a different side of things -- none of my loves ever survived the nastiness of my life -- it's nice to see that there can be hope at the end.  Because she really isn't a bad person, she isn't a delinquent, she is just hurting a pain that is unimaginable (unless you have lost your mother, you don't know how you will act) and overwhelming, especially if you are a teen.  And regardless of what those jaded people have to say, love *can* make you decide to change your path, it can make you want to be the best person you can be.It was a nice Hollywood story about love and choices.  And Jay Hernandez was hot.  I'm glad that the sex scenes weren't too graphic, though -- I wasn't interested in watching porn, which is what you get in a lot of movies today. Sometimes it is nice just to get a feeling of the closeness of two individuals without graphic sex scenes ruining the feeling.  Again, if you want to see more skin, the internet is full of porn - some of it for free - go check it out, leave this movie alone.  Besides, teenage sex isn't always that thrilling, it is more about the desire and the emotions, and we got a full dose of that (I think) in the movie already.  But it is also a movie your teenagers can see and you can comment to them on the choices that you are faced with and how you affect other people -- and it is a story line that they can relate to.I wish I had seen all of the movie, instead of sharing it with Frazier, and had I known there was a movie on tonight that I was going to want to see I would have set the VCR.  This is a movie that is worth seeing, if you are a romantic and believe that teen love can lead to something positive.  I rate it up there with Say Anything as a good story about teen love.

I guess it's the fame Kirsten Dunst got over the years (Get Over it, Strike!, Bring It On, etc.) I only liked her in The Virgin Suicides and Levity (actually she played a similar character there), and thought that in Spiderman she did the job ok. On the other hand, there was this guy (Jay Hernandez) whom I had never heard about, but I figured he would just be the cool latin cute guy stereotype in teen movies. On imdb.com the movie was rated 6.5 which was pretty good for this kind of films, and had overall good comments. I usually have a peek at these two factors before watching a movie, but they're obviously not essential. But enough about my expectations. Let's talk about what I experienced.The plot is really basic and you feel like you've seen this story a thousand times before. But... sometimes it's the way in which something is told that makes the difference. And I believe this is why it got me. It got me from the very beginning, and I just wanted to see scene after scene. It glued me to the seat at some point. I felt for the characters, which is important. They had depth, they had background. I identified myself with Jay's character, as he always tried to do the right thing and avoided trouble. The differences and the connection between the two worlds were very well done. The acting was also good, especially Kirsten Dunst and her father. Jay was ok, I think he really didn't have to try very hard for this role.SPOILERS AHEADSome reviewers said that the movie made them reflect about certain aspects of life, or something like that. Well, I guess I don't need a movie to do that for myself, but maybe after you've seen it, you might start to wonder what would be really important for your life. Jay had his family, that sacrificed hard for him to go to school. He was the only one in the family that could have some sort of career ahead of him. And falling in love with Nicole would probably mess it up, not to mention escaping town with her. And Nicole, she had everything in the material field, but lacked love (although she did have that weird friend). She found in Carlos what she needed. The story develops on an ideal pace and style, making you feel that every scene has a purpose and that you are not wasting your time. Even the videoclips of their relationship were very fun to watch. The dramatic component of the picture is well mixed in the overall. Not too much, not too less.Overall, this is a good nice film. If you happen to rent it, you will have a good time.

I wasn't expecting much because i'd heard many critic bashings of it (although i've learnt never to listen to critics properly coz they're all arrogant and kno sod all), i forced myself to watch the film because i love kirsten dunst and i think she's the best actress of this generation.I sat as the film started and was immediatly hooked, the way the film was introduced was brilliant, and i was straight away drawn to kirsten as good she looks in this film, she isn't covered in make-up, she's natural.When the film ended i sat for a few minutes and reflected on the masterpiece that i had just witnessed. It wasn't a normal teen romance, this was an actual drama and a brilliantly written 1 at that. The characters are well created (and its nice to see that the girl's messed up for once, doin the drugs & drinkin). The cast was brilliant, but i was suprised about this as jay hernandez is a newcomer but he held his own well against the great kiki dunst. And the best performance may hav bin kirsten's dad (i can't remember the actors name) but he was great playin the roll of a father who didn't kno how to control his daughter although who clearly loved her, he just didn't kno how to express it.All in all this was a great film and if you are the slightest bit sensitive you will probably shed a tear at somepoint.

Even though the movie is really slow, it's an okay movie. If you like the Save the Last Dance idea of two people from different background having a relationship it's a good one.

It's a teen romance. It's a problem drama. It almost always feels like one of several other movies. And yet the cast is strong, the direction is frequently fresh, and for a long time that's enough to keep Crazy/Beautiful interesting.Nicole (Kirsten Dunst) and Carlos (Jay Hernandez) meet on the beach. He's hanging with his homies and she's performing community service picking up trash. They hit it off, but they're both more complicated than they seem. She's a depressive alcoholic sun of a Congressman (Bruce Davidson), while he's a football player who dreams of going to the Naval Academy and rising up from the barrio of East LA. Naturally they fall in love, but naturally there are obstacles. He's going places and she's going crazy, for example. But will love overcome said obstacles? It seems possible.Crazy/Beautiful's script, by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, frequently seems too structure-bound.In this roughly 100 minute film, you can easily chart the beats as Nicole and Carlos develop their relationship against the odds and fall in love only to have the odds escalated partway through Act 2. There's an awkward Happy Montage around the 45 minute mark that's painfully scripted. They also touch on many themes constant to the Outsider Romance genre.Director John Stockwell (apparently Dean's son) seems to be making a slightly different film. This is as gritty as a mainstream studio teen romance can be. Stockwell and his DP Shane Hurbut revel in oversaturated day scenes and grainy night footage. The editing is pleasantly jangly, perhaps the only film in the recent teen cycle to effectively use a jump cut (unless I'm missing such freshness in She's All That or Can't Hardly Wait). Stockwell nicely shoots his attractive leads and gets fine performances from each.You wish, however, that Hernandez's character was darker. His life feels oversanitized, but around the edges you see hints that things could have been more interesting -- the Hispanic girl his mother obviously prefers to Dunst, his less intelligent brother, etc. Dunst's character feels similarly sketched out. I wished her depression arc had been better established. There's no question that the character is messed up, but mostly she just seems to have a drinking problem. Since the film's dialogue makes it clear that the problems are far more serious, it would have been interesting to see that.I get the feeling that Stockwell made a darker and more complex drama and that he had to tone down language, depression, and sexuality in order to land a PG-13 movie. And that's disappointing because I would guess that many of my complaints could have been handled with ten or fifteen minutes more footage. As it is, I liked this movie enough to give it a 6/10, but I wished that it had more to set it apart.

He gets good grades because he has to make a good living because his family is poor. Plus, he's Latino which will pose a problem later. Then there's Nicole Oakley (Kirsten Dunst), she's the goof off kid who thinks everything is joke. She's a drinker as well. The two meet and form an infatuation. It's a big deal because she's white and he's Latino. Which doesn't even matter in today's standards so I don't see why everyone made a deal about it. When Nicole and Carlos start hanging out, Carlos' grades start slipping and he's not the great student he used to be.Carlos is also trying to get into college to become a pilot. Nicole's father, Tom Oakley (Bruce Davidson, who looks lost) is, by a coincidence, a person that can help him get in. He's a senator or something among those lines, but who really cares?

I liken her performance to James Dean in Rebel without a cause. Strip out the typical portrayal of street thug friends who can't deal with one of their crew looking to get out, the family who can't deal with their son dating a girl from another ethnicity, and the evil stepmom, and you're left with a girl struggling with her own issues and her own dark side. That battle is enough to warrant a good rating for this movie. The fact that her love for the boy brings about her change of attitude is but a distraction - I think she needed to figure it out for herself - and that might have been a much more interesting movie. "},{"Title":"Nicole The End","Date":"16 November 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  crazy/beautiful is among the most frustrating films of 2001. There are two ostensible reasons why this is so, both of which are partially true. One is that a family-friendly studio had one too many fingers in the director's rather daring pie. crazy/beautiful is among the most noted victims of the push for PG-13 ratings. If the director's dark R-rated original vision had been allowed to stand, then perhaps the entire thing would work better. The other reason is most obvious and less a matter of speculation. Most of the ingredients were second rate from the get-go and the acting so accentuates those weaknesses that they seem far worse than they would if all aspects of the film were equally bad. You want the whole movie to be worthy of the transcendent Kirsten Dunst, whose performance as Nicole seethes with raw, adolescent power. You want it to be worthy of Jay Hernandez's quiet, conflicted grace as Carlos. You want it to be worthy of Bruce Davidson's lovely if slightly confused humanity as Nicole's congressman dad. But it is not worthy of them. Few movies would be. As it stands, they elevate a movie otherwise is so cliched and standard that you wish you could lift them out of it and put them in one that does them justice. The movie's major problems are these the voice-overs at the beginning and end could have been dumped entirely. The characterizations of everyone but the main three and Nicole's best friend (who also gives a terrific performance and is shamefully abandoned two-thirds of the way in) could have been miles better. The plot could have been more original. The relationships between the characters could have been more clearly drawn. The ending needs to be redone almost entirely; the talk could stay but things aren't resolved so easily. The ending comes too quickly and feels like a cheat not worthy of the emotions the performances have evoked. An entirely different and unhappy ending would undoubtedly be more powerful, but I don't know if my heart could have taken it. The movie's primary strength, and I cannot stress this enough, is the acting. Great as Davidson and Hernandez are, though, it is Dunst who truly breathes as her character. Kirsten gives a performance I do not hesitate to call worthy of an Oscar nomination. The finest work yet of this young actress's already remarkable career, it bodes very well for her future. She has incidental gifts- her beauty, lithe body and youth- but she is one actress with which you can dismiss those in favor of her primary one, which is acting. Not looking like a glossy Xerox of a human being on-screen, but acting. She is a young, thin, pretty, blond actress who can force people that automatically dismiss all young, thin, pretty, blond actresses to admit that she is talented. Here, buried underneath wane skin, dirty hair and a lost smile, she is complex and heart-breaking. Here, in a movie that treats teenagers as the complex people they are, I wanted to see and know more about her. I wanted the movie, despite its flaws, to be two hours long so that I could.I've heard it suggested that crazy/beautiful is a pale imitation of a handful of movies, like Larry Clark's Bully (which also features some powerful performances by young actors), that strive to show adolescents as they truly are in the face of the sparkly barrage of teen flicks. I don't believe this is so. Very few kids are murderers or rapists of big-time drug addicts. Those are the extreme cases. The biggest tragedies of youth are relatively quiet ones, the kids who can be saved and sometimes aren't. Kids like Nicole- and we all know kids like her. "}{"Title":"Teen flick with substance","Date":"10 November 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  (May contain spoilers)Rather hard to imagine, but Crazy/beautiful is a teen flick with substance. Its story -- about two teenagers from different sides of the track who fall in love with each other -- may not be awfully new or whatnot, but the movie contains some subplots that give it something original, something that other teen flicks (Drive Me Crazy, for instance) do not have. I cannot think of another movie that caters to the teenage audience that deals with troubled teenagers with, for example, alcohol problems. Nicole (Kirsten Dunst) must be the most intriguing character I've ever seen in a teen movie. She's messed up, she's neglected, and she's in serious need for love. She's someone many teenage girls can relate to, and Kirsten Dunst, much better here than in the ridiculous Bring It On, excellently brings her to life. Her performance was heart-felt, solid, and, to be honest, totally surprising to me, as she really, really annoyed me in Bring It On. The relationship between her and her father is also another highlight of the movie. Nicole's dad (forget character and actor's names) is extremely real, in the sense that the audience doesn't see him as a father who neglects his daughter just because he hasn't got time for her, or because he can't be bothered. The movie scripts their relationship in a way that allows the audience to get into their relationship and understand the conflict from both parties. Nicole gets herself drunk whenever she feels like it primarily because she thinks her father doesn't love her, and Dad doesn't shower her with the love she needs because she reminds him too much of his dead wife. This is the most genuine father-daughter relationship I've ever seen in a teenage movie.crazy/beautiful suffers a couple of setbacks a too conventional wicked stepmother, and a rather boring leading man. Jay Hernandez, who played Nicole's boyfriend Carlos, was only okay in his role, and he was completely overshadowed by Dunst. Nicole's stepmom was simply not human. I'm sorry, but not since Snow White have I seen a stepmother character as flat as this one.Despite that, Crazy/beautiful is a movie worth watching. It also has a terrific soundtrack to boot (Emilianna Torrini's To Be Free, The Dandy Warhols's Sleep). I recommend both of them.

There is not much suspense, and everybody here is just more or less goodhearted. And its the oldest story of the world, once again told in some different manner. There are problems, but while they look big on the first sight, all are in reality quite small, and it is always clear that they will find a solution.The story was very detailed, and worked in many respects. But after the movie I've read that the director actually wanted to make a movie about the problems of teenagers, and I was really surprised by that. Well, maybe there are some teenagers out there who have the same problems, but I fear they are quite seldom, and one actually would have to envy them for their easy life. Most teenagers are not rich, are not overly talented, have not parents who allow them everything, and so on.I also read that Kirsten Dunst stripped most of the nudity from the now very short sexscene from the movie, and I have to congratulate her for that, because it would have only served as a brutal interruption to the overall feel-good-feeling of the movie. After all, its a far, far better movie than her last movie, the cheesy 'Get Over It'.I think the whole thing is just a unpolitical light fun movie. Mostly harmless.

It never should have ended, but my god, I never knew John Stockwell, an ok actor to begin with, could pull this kind of movie off!  This film is not fake, not corny, not cheesy, just very daring, even for a PG-13 film!  Kirsten Dunst makes a performance that makes you just want to love her to death.  It may very well be the best work she's ever done and to see her do this just makes me wanna marry her.One of the reasons why I love movies and I'll say this because of seeing Crazy/Beautiful, is that they want to challenge the audience and be daring.  It's very shocking to find out that John Stockwell really understands cultures and knows how music helps a film as a part of its narrative, not just music playing on the overhead and being cheesy.  I mean, there is Spanish-speaking hip-hop in the Latino guy's neighborhood.  Not Spanish hip-hop, someone speaking Spanish doing hip-hop.  Of course, Amores Perros has had this before, but Crazy/Beautiful is mainstream and PG-13. My god, this film looks gritty, yet there's so much respect for characters.  I call this film third world filmmaking in the first world, because you feel respect for every character, well, not the jocks (by the way, the portrayal of the white jock was among the best I've ever seen in my life... just brutal and straight on HARD).  And even the father of Dunst's character is likeable and not an ass.  He's very human, respects the hispanic and latino community.  Cares for his daughter, even though she's hard to deal with. There's sex in this movie, but it's not the kind that you like.  It's the kind that Dunst's character wants, but the latino guy tells her it's not ok and stuff, even though he's cool.  In addition, I've never seen a more honest portrayal of hispanics or latinos since the movie Selena.  And John Stockwell is a white guy and he must be the coolest guy on earth to talk to.

They deal with many more dramatic issues than the themes dealt with in movies such as American Pie or Road Trip, or whatever. Those movies are good on a gross-out teen comedy level, but crazy/beautiful is something different, and much more thought-provoking. Basically, Nicole (Dunst) is the rich girl living in a beautiful big house who seems to have it all, but she is really empty inside. She does drugs, alcohol, and is suicidal. Carlos (Hernandez) is a poor Latino teen from a run-down neighborhood, but he is an excellent student and has a bright future ahead of him. He wants to make something of himself. When he and Nicole meet, sparks fly, but trouble brews as well. Can the couple stay together through the hard times? Will Nicole destroy Carlos' bright future? This is a great movie which you should definitely see. I like how it was shot, and the love story between Nicole and Carlos was extremely romantic and steamy (well on a PG-13 level anyway). I liked the outcome of the movie. It makes you feel good inside. I'm glad Kirsten did a movie like this, it was a good role to take on. I desperately want to see this movie again, but it is out of the theaters already, and so fast! I'm thinking maybe it didn't do the greatest at the box office? That's too bad.

Crazy/Beautiful was at least different, if not a cut above the rest. I'm quickly becoming a Kirsten Dunst fan (and believe me, Dick didn't make it easy).  Anyway, on to the film.  It really plays around with our stereotypes about race and economic class, as we'd expect the poor Latino to be the one into drugs, alcohol, and all that rather than the rich princess white girl.  As someone mentioned, the leads are clearly beyond high school age, but hey, what do you expect? The acting wasn't superb, but it wasn't mediocre.  I really liked Taryn Manning, too. She's quite lovely, and her and Dunst have an odd kind of chemistry, if you know what I mean.  The story was decent, and it did manage to pick up some steam.  The later scenes between Nicole and her father are quite touching.   That said, let's move on to some problems (and some more spoilers) The whirlwind romance seems a little too fast-paced.  Carlos seems to have a may as well attitude about many of the early proceedings.  There's a scene where they argue about the merits of their school (Carlos's You joke around. . .I get up at 5 am to get here. . . rant) that comes virtually out of the blue.  I would think that Carlos, being Hispanic, would be strongly influenced by the wishes of his family, and his desire to make something of himself. Yet, he risks everything for a messed-up rich lush, when he's (probably) attractive enough to have the pick of the field. ------Spoilers Approaching------The scene at the school where he says I don't care about. . .I want to be with you pretty much disgusted me.  Throughout, he doesn't seem to have strong reasons to love her; she is damn hot, but she disrupts his life and interferes with his dreams. . .I would have walked out and let her go to the rehab place.  I mean, he's risking his dreams for a girlfriend that he caught half-naked in a hot tub kissing another guy! But don't get me wrong, I'm just bitter.  Despite these problems, it's still worth it.

I thought that Crazy/Beautiful was a good movie overall, but I think that the high points of the picture come from Kirsten Dunst expanding herself to fit a role that is basically opposite of all her other appearences.  She plays a troubled teen, similar to Lux Lisbon, her role in The Virgin Suicides, but as Lisbon her character seems to have everything figured out.  As Nicole Oakley in Crazy/Beautiful, her problems are right up front, and Dunst shows the dark side of teen life wonderfully.  Jay Hernandez does a great job with his character, the poor, but hard working and ambitious Carlos Nunez.  This is a great start for Hernandez in his first major role as far as I know.  Over all, I think that Crazy/Beautiful is a quality movie for fans of Kirsten Dunst (YES I AM) and those tired of the perfect teen flicks.  7/10 "},{"Title":"All around Great Movie!","Date":"30 June 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  I saw the previews for this movie, and it looked great!!

Kirsten Dunst was just awesome.  She got overlooked by the Academy for The Virgin Suicides and hopefully that will not happen again.  She does a total 180 from Dick, Bring It On, Get Over It, and Drop Dead Gorgeous.  I think It's about damn time a teen movie got an Academy Award.  The last one to accomplish this, If I'm not mistaken, was Carrie 25 years ago.  And that's debatable on whether or not it was a teen film.  The story wasn't totally original but it turned a typical plot line into entertainment with different twists.  And although the two main characters were teenagers who had sex they pulled it off because they showed them stopping for a condom.  Yes, teens do use condoms.  Jay Hernandez was extremely good for his first major film role.  The debut writers did an excellent job with the dialogue and creating characters in a movie that are so realistic to people I know.  It was also refreshing to see Adults have decently  written parts in a movie like this.  Give Kirsten her well deserved Oscar or at least an MTV movie Award for Best Female Performance.  It didn't look like she was acting drunk.  It looked like she was downright loaded.  Taryn Manning also did an excellent job as Kirsten's best friend.

Not only did the ending leave a lot of unanswered questions, but the entire plot of the film was futilely thin.Although you have to applaud the originality of this movie. The stereotypical idea would be that Carlos and a rich posh white girl fall in love but they must overcome obstacles of narrow-minded society and possibly her overbearing Hispanic/African American/etc-hating father. That would have been the easy way out, I think. Instead they opted to make Nicole a drunken mess, irresponsible and crazy, which made it a little more realistic. And instead of not liking Carlos and not accepting him because of his race, her father not only liked him, but gasp favored him enough to sponsor him into the Naval Academy at Annapolis!Previews of Crazy/Beautiful made it seem as if it would be focused on the familiar clashing-of-races idea. However, this hardly seems to be the point at all in the movie, which focuses more on Dunst's nervous-wreck state and how that affects their relationship.Anyway. As original as this movie might have been, it still was a disappointment. Definitely not worth the $7.25 I paid for admission. Maybe okay for rental someday.

This movie was different from Bring it On and Get Over It as Dunst was able to show off her darker side, a feat which she does beautifully.

This romantic drama stars Kirsten Dunst and Jay Hernandez. It is largely set at Palisades Charter High School and the surrounding area, including Downtown Los Angeles, Pacific Palisades, Malibu and East Los Angeles. The Romeo and Juliet story has been modernized to a high school setting previously, but this romance from director John Stockwell turns the tale inside out.The story follows a familiar pattern wherein the two young lovers come from different worlds, and no one else understands them but has a few intelligent wrinkles to the standard star-crossed plot. Carlos is a straight-laced poor boy working his way toward a better life. Thus,he is an A-student with big dreams who endures a two-hour bus ride every morning to attend high school in an upscale L.A. neighborhood.Nicole is a rich girl with a wild streak who can't seem to stay out of trouble. Can it be that they're meant for each other? Yes, of course it can.Fate steps in and brings together two high school seniors from opposite sides of the track in this sexy, fun, and energetic story of first love. Their innocent flirtations quickly develop into passionate love.When his friends, family, and even Nicole's own father oppose the romance for Carlos' sake, he chooses to ignore their advice and stubbornly pursues his relationship with Nicole, whose feelings grow from simple physical attraction to something much deeper. But Nicole's self-destructive behavior threatens their relationship and puts Carlos' promising future in jeopardy. As teen love stories go, you could do far worse. Adults may be left cold by Crazy/Beautiful, but teens especially those with a dramatic streak will enjoy this well-intentioned romance. The story is not new, but the film gets credit for trying to move away from the genre's clichés. Also,Kirsten Dunst and newcomer Jay Hernandez give believable performances as young lovers.Added to that,the dramatic moments come from dialogue not actions, and much of the time viewers are left on their own to fill in the words that remain unspoken.And finally,the movie's message of tolerance comes across without being preachy.

However it does a fine job depicting the all-too-common problem among American teens today who have too much money and freedom, and not enough integrity. I don't live in California but I see it all around me.

However, this film turned out to be a pleasant departure from the perky candy coated parts Dunst has played in the past.  In fact, this might be a watershed role for her, marking her transition from teen roles to adult roles.Dunst plays Nicole Oakley, a troubled teenager from a privileged family who falls in love with Carlos (Jay Hernandez), a boy from the wrong side of the tracks.  The story is nothing new, but the presentation is remarkably good, with far greater maturity than one would expect from a high school flick.This film is exceptional considering its limited budget and the fact that most of the major players have very little experience at this level.  For writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, this is their first feature film screenplay.  For director John Stockwell, it is only his second feature film.  Likewise for Jay Hernandez and Taryn Manning.  Many of the Latino actors were cast from a local high school, so they are in their first film.  By comparison, Kirsten Dunst is a jaded veteran.  The use of so many ordinary (not professional actors) high school students in the film gives it a very genuine look and feel.  Stockwell turns in an impressive directorial effort with a story that is much more complex than it seems at first blush.  It starts out as your standard boy-meets-girl love story.  They flirt, act silly, have sex, fall in love and create beautiful romantic images on the beach.  Just when you think it is going to be a real yawner, things begin to get complicated.  Stockwell slowly peels away the layers of the two main characters and their families to reveal subterranean shearing forces that will act to tear them apart.  Nicole, who at first seems to be just a wild, rebellious brat, turns out to be far deeper and more emotionally unsettled than one would ever imagine.  Carlos' humble roots and burning ambition bring the relationship to a breaking point when he has to decide between Nicole and his shot at Annapolis.  Stockwell takes what could have been a trite teen romance and turns it into an engaging character study.  While his pace is perhaps a bit too deliberate and inclusive, his sensitive treatment of the motivation of the characters and his style of unraveling their psyches slowly before our eyes makes for great drama.  This film is full of `ahah' moments, where you find yourself re-evaluating the characters as some new piece of information is revealed.Kirsten Dunst has had an active career, appearing in over twenty films before the age of twenty (which age she will attain in April 2002).  This is by far her best performance, helped by the fact that it is the most complex character she has ever played.  There was a hint that her ability extended beyond the superficial teen characters she normally plays in the film `Virgin Suicides', where she played a sullen, bad girl with some serious problems.  As Nicole in this film, she shows us that she has extraordinary range.  She really cuts loose with the character, taking her to exhilarating and uninhibited highs as well as crashing, depression ridden lows.  Though this is a minor film from a box office perspective, this performance should get the attention of casting directors and open the door for her to get bigger, more serious parts.  Jay Hernandez shows promise, although he seems a little wooden in this film.  His great strength (other than his obvious good looks) is his sincerity.  He comes across as if he means every word he says.  I was going crazy trying to figure out where I had seen Bruce Davidson (who played Tom Oakley) before.  He played Willard in the film of the same name (1971) about a sociopathic kid who befriended rats and used them to attack his enemies.  Davidson gives a good performance here as Nicole's congressman father, particularly in the touching scene at the end.Herman Osario, Miguel Castro and Tommy De La Cruz were all cast for their first film in open auditions from thousands of Latino high school students.  They provide the film with some of its lighter moments as Carlos' friends, and they all give fantastic performances, basically being themselves.  Taryn Manning rounds out the cast as Nicole's best friend and does a fine job of playing the wild thing.I liked this film more for the drama than the romance.  I rated it an 8/10.  Kirsten Dunst takes a quantum leap with this performance.  It is not for impatient viewers or those who despise slushy romances.  However, for those who like a good character study with emotionally charged content and complex characters it is well worth a look.

Together, they delivered a touching pair of teenagers in love. Quite a tearjerker, too. The film, directed by John Stockwell, is beyond merely another teenage angst movie from Hollywood. This one has substance and takes on the teen problems and situations up front and centered without any qualms in baring harsh facts and angles. Yet there is heart and love - being the backbone to the situations presented - with Carlos standing by taking a simple honest look at the troubled Nicole, yes, love conquers all (and we don't care how cliché that may sound.) Carlos demonstrates his pure of heart approach overcoming the fear and dilemma Nicole's father, poignantly portrayed by Bruce Davison, was struggling with. It's Hollywood, but this is good Hollywood stuff - worthwhile movie to sit through and appreciate. The premise of a troubled teenage rich girl story in Mad Love 1995 with Drew Barrymore and Chris O'Donnell is superficial compared to this unexpectedly well-done Crazy/Beautiful. Kirsten Dunst was outstanding in her debut film Interview with the Vampire 1994, at a tender age of 12 playing opposite Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. In 1999, she stood out with her performances in Sofia Coppola's Virgin Suicides, The and in the fun satires Dick and Drop Dead Gorgeous. Last year she was the radiant cheerleading energy in Bring It On. A maturing young actor Dunst is becoming.I first remember the name Bruce Davison in signs of the time Strawberry Statement, The 1970. I even saw him in the not so pleasant Willard 1971. The name resurfaced for me in the PBS poignant production of Longtime Companion 1990. Also remember him in Robert Altman's ensemble cast of Short Cuts 1993, and (TV's Thirtysomething) Peter Horton's The Cure 1995 with wonderful child performances by Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro. Davison was part of an ensemble cast in The King Is Alive 2000 - not an easy to take 'desert' experience. Here in CRAZY/BEAUTIFUL, once again he took on an emotionally challenging role as Dunst's all too busy congressman father in need of parenting skills and practice. It's a small but important part well delivered.

However, and I wish I didn't have to bring up this again, but how many times do I have to see a teen movie, or any type of movie in general, where the only reason it's rated PG-13 is not because of the artistci stance, but because the studio wants more money with a PG-13 movie.  I can think of Crazy/Beautiful as a rated R movie and having even more guts, realism, and more and it would make this a excellent movie, but no, kids have to get the chance to see teens that get drunk and drive and all that.  I mean, think of it this way, the only 2 Dunst movies that are really known AND are rated R movies arew The Virgin Suicides (ala Coppolla magic) and Interview with the Vampire.  Hopefully someday Hollywood will realize that rated R movies might be better that PG-13 movies and that just upping the sales for the movie won't matter.I won't keep my hopes up.

The story--about a straight-arrowMexican-American kid (Jay Hernandez) and the car crash of a richwhite girl he loves (Kirsten Dunst)--seems familiar at first, but themovie finds unexpected wrinkles. (The best comes when Dunst'sfather, a liberal congressman played by Bruce Davison, forbidsHernandez to see his daughter--for Hernandez's sake, notpropriety's.) Shot in a rougher, more beautifully seams-showingstyle than any contemporary studio teen movie, the picture builds awonderful languor--it feels like gazing at the sleeping face of abeloved.

It will probably take a few years, and,unfortunately, some flossier, tonier movies, but Dunst will no doubtsoon be recognized as the best actor of the generation coming upnow--male or female.

The mutually attracted pair find out they go to the same high school, but have different groups of friends. She likes to go out and get drunk. He wants to get good grades and attend the US Naval Academy. He's on the football team. She's a skank. These differences lead to conflict, which threatens their love relationship. Complicating matters, her father is a Congressman...Crazy/Beautiful is interesting in how it switches what you may expect to be the bad and good characters. With her beauty intentionally toned down (but bouncy sexiness intact), Ms. Dunst identifies her bad-girl as the crazy co-star and Mr. Hernandez as the beautiful half. The labeling occurs in an amusing scene where Dunst aggressively moves her head down toward Hernandez' lower body, but is interrupted by her father (Bruce Davidson). Hernandez turns away, but Dunst isn't shy about having sex in front of dad because she has retrieved a condom from the kitchen cabinet. Director John Stockwell helms his sexy scenes well...Hernandez is intentionally more beautiful than Dunst. They do not impress as a high school-aged couple, with Hernandez suffering more. His eyebrows are plucked to perfection; obviously, each individual hair was carefully considered before removal. Hernandez' make-up is too delicately applied. With all the loving looks at Hernandez' beautiful chest, we wonder if the character would be more plausible as a professional model than a high school football player. In fact, Hernandez' character could have been a college student and Dunst a high school drop-out. That would have been more convincing. Still, they are great looking couple.***** Crazy/Beautiful (6/28/01) John Stockwell ~ Kirsten Dunst, Jay Hernandez, Bruce Davison, Lucinda Jenney "},{"Title":"Thought this was supposed to be real?","Date":"1 January 2015","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" I was born in the early 60s and grew up in the 70's during my teen years. As a young man, I loved that time love was open, recreational drugs were plentiful, the economy was decent, and oh, a lot of chicks didn't wear bras. I have read ( yet cannot confirm) that Dunst has some sort of no-bra policy, but I don't recall her mandate ever being obvious in her other films. In this case, it sort of throws a monkey wrench in the credibility machine. Allow me to explain. If you are a teacher or principal at a high school, a doting FATHER, fellow friend, unknown person you engage in public, or a woman who is hell-bent on judging you who has given birth by your father, I cannot imagine ANY scenario where NO ONE ever makes a comment that this teenager never wears a bra, and on top of that, seemingly never washes her greasy hair. This simply makes no sense to me. She not only goes braless, but also wears cut off t-shirts or shirts that are open on the sides, SO, the look is intentional/deliberate and is accentuated. Kirsten's bulbous CC-cups( just guessing the size) bounces throughout the entire film and no one ever seems to care or even notices the slutty appearance of a character who is only 17-18. Even her gal-pal goes braless in a couple of scenes and in a long segment of the movie, she jokes about her forgetting to wear a top. ( she's wearing a micro bra or bikini AS a top) So, at this point I have to conclude this may be not a mandate by our lead but some sort of fantasy whipped up by one of the producers or the director. In 2001, its entirely inappropriate to unilaterally condone this look for a teenager. Thing is, at the core, its a decent teen-romance film, replete with come cliché's but its cool anyway. We LIKE the characters. There's decent acting chops here, along with marginal writing and production skills. Its a good movie. But there is definitely an intent by whomever, for me to be distracted by bouncing breasts, which ( even though titillating) is wildly inappropriate and unrealistically presented in this context.

The story is just the typical unaccepted romance, with the happy ending which is in plain sight of everyone but the most naive of viewers, less than two minutes into the film. Think of every single cliche and stereotype for teen dramas; the interracial relationship, the teen who's headed for trouble because he/she feels the need to rebel, the troubled relationship, the parent who doesn't accept this or that... every single one, with one or two possible exceptions is crammed into this movie. The plot is decent, but it's seen before, and it's been done better. The pace is decent, but pretty draggy, for a 90 minute film. The acting ranges, from good to pretty bad. Dunst's performance ranges between those two. The various other actors performances range; about half of them are good, and the other half bad. The characters are, like I mentioned before, mostly stereotypes. That makes it fairly hard to relate to any of them, or even care the slightest about what happens to them. The dialog is flat. The humor is nearly non-existent(arguably not necessarily something that needs to be taken into account in a romance-drama, but still) and often badly delivered. The romance portion of the film is so dull, predictable and fake in appearance; like another reviewer so eloquently put it, a few Kodak moments do not make a good romance. All in all, I guess the film is decent, average. Nothing more, possibly a little less. I recommend it to fans of the actors, fans of teen dramas, and fans of romance movies.

Films like GREMLINS or INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM could never be rated R, but they were just too much for the kiddies to take. Thus, the PG-13 rating was born. And hell followed with it.Now, in the early days of the 21st century, the market is flooded with films made to excite teens, but not be so explicit as to force the kids to bring along their parents. This problem couldn't be any better defined that it is with CRAZY/BEAUTIFUL. Here we have what could have been one hell of a movie, but it is so diluted that the point gets lost. The characters in this film are very interesting. The problems they face are interesting. The way the events play out in the movie is not so interesting. For example, we know these kids love each other. We know they are sexually active. Why not let us see a beautiful love scene between them? Shots of them in their underwear just don't get it done. We as the audience are entitled to see their passion play out more realistically. Dunst and Hernandez have a winning chemistry that gives a familiar story line a needed boost. The screenplay should have kept up better their energy.I really wanted to like this film a lot more than I did. Either the director or the studio needed to have more balls and make this film as good as it should have been. Hollywood needs to realize that you don't need total porn to excite your audience. You do, however, need to take the gloves off and show your audience more of what kids are really doing these days. Sigh......I can only give CRAZY/BEAUTIFUL 5 of 10 stars.

Her performance in the big budget disappointment &#145;Spiderman' (that was horrible in my view) was pretty ordinary. Some of the blame lies in the terrible script that the movie presented, some in the way that her character of &#145;Mary Jane Watson' was written and some in Dunst's acting. So it was with trepidation that I picked up a copy of &#145;Crazy/Beautiful'. I was going to give Dunst's one last chance to redeem herself.When fate steps in and brings together two high school seniors from opposites sides of the tracks, it is something Crazy/Beautiful in this sexy, fun energetic story of first love. Nicole is the 17-year-old daughter of a wealthy congressman who never met a rule she didn't break. Carlos is an A student with big dreams who endues a two-hour bus ride every morning to get to attend high school in an upscale L.A.neighbourhood. Their innocent flirtations quickly develop into passionate love, but Nicole's self destructive behaviour threatens their relationship and puts Carlos future in jeopardy. Will their intense passion keep them together despite the objections of their families or will Carlos be forced to plan his life&#133;without Nicole?The stories main focuses is on the rebellious character of Nicole (Dunst), a girl who is troubled by her past and is thought of to be just a &#145;trouble maker'. Things soon change for Nicole when she meets Latino Carlos (Jay Hernandez). He is a contentious student and popular football player. Yet, when the pair meet at school and Nicole gets Carlos a detention, he gets very upset claiming `I'm bused two hours each ways. If I wanted to screw up, I'd do it in my own school and get a lot more sleep.' However after the pair have met, you can see that they are attracted to each other.Soon the pair fall deeply in love, and as love sick teenage do, things lead to the bedroom. Yet in Nicole's room the windows are wide open for everyone to see and you quickly learn that Nicole is a girl into casual and promiscuous sex. Carlos insists on using a condom and when he sees Nicole's dad at her bedroom window, he is concerned that the pair will get into trouble.  Nicole just laughs saying `that's my Dad. He doesn't care. I can do anything. We're using a condom- he'd be so proud. And a person of colour in his daughter's bed!'Nicole's Dad, Tom (Bruce Davidson) is another vital character to the story. As he is an important liberal congressman, he meets Carlos, for what he thinks is a meeting to discuss his career at Annapolis. Instead, Tom warns Carlos to stay away from his daughter for his own good. It is as if he feels that his daughter is a lost cause, and that no one can help him. However, Carlos defies Tom, setting out to help Nicole, proving that he really does love her. When Nicole and her Dad are in embrace at the conclusion of the film, Tom's second wife is only infatuated with their first child, totally oblivious to the plight of her stepdaughter Nicole, a girl that desperately needs help. Tom keeps iterating &#145;what about my daughter?'The main highlight of this movie for me was the wonderful story which the screenplay had. It was written by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi. I especially like the way the main characters are written, being opposite people from opposite neighbourhoods. You could be mistaken for believing that Carlos and Nicole are completely wrong for each other, yet the story allows them to become involved in a way that suits the pair. Other points that need to be emphasised from &#145;Crazy/Beautiful' include the use of scenes that are ad-libbed, such as the dancing scene, beach scenes and the plane scene, that I felt all worked. There was also the use of the hand picked actors, which helped make up the supporting cast. While it was difficult to understand Carlos' friend's lingo, they did what the story needed them to do. I can understand that some people might see this as a down side to the film, as professional actors would have given a much different performance. But I feel they these guys were doing what comes naturally, just what the script to this film required.I really like how this movie is titled, as I feel it is saying that &#145;crazy can be beautiful', which indeed it can. Nicole is very much both. Perhaps too crazy for her own good. Nicole looked very depressed to me, which is of great credit to the make up department and to Dunst's, who stayed in her character for the entire movie. I also understand what it is like to feel like an &#145;outcast', and it is not that great. &#145;Crazy/Beautiful' is a less emotional, but much harder-hitting version of &#145;Save the last dance'. But what both films do well is deal with the issues surrounding mixed-race relationships, which I know are not that easy. So if you are looking for a fun night's entertainment, than you have to watch &#145;Crazy/Beautiful'.

That's a real shame, because Dunst and Hernandez are both VERY attractive (they do look good in their underwear) and extremely good actors. Heck, I'd have no problem seeing either one nude! But the studio backed down--stupid censors! So we're left with a very predictable outing, but entertaining with two great performances. My only complaint--it's very obvious that Dunst and Hernandez are way over high school age (he's 23, she's 20--I think). There is good strong support by Bruce Davison as Nicole's understanding father. So, it's good but it could have been so much better. When will the studios back off and let directors film what they want to?

At the beach and then at school he meets Nicole, the daughter of a US Senator, apparently a care free rich girl whose solely preoccupation seems to be getting drunk and causing troubles.When their lives intertwine and her background becomes unraveled, you see a tragic figure of a girl torn to pieces in her early childhood, and as they become more and more infatuated with each other and her father has promised to help him realize his dreams with the one condition to stay away from her, because he is ruining his life by being with her, he will have to make a choice between his dreams and her.The movie is very gritty, the lightning and make up give it a very realistic feeling and the story becomes really sad in one or two scenes, this movie is emotionally packed, very well directed, and the performances are nothing short of amazing.This is probably one of my favorite movies of all time.

Basically troubled and wealthy 17-year-old Nicole Oakley (Kirsten Dunst) always breaks rules, and she meets grade-A student Carlos Nuñez (Jay Hernandez) who has big dreams. They are first innocently flirting, but they quickly develop a passionate love, only to be spoilt by Nicole's self-destructive behaviour and Carlos's future in jeopardy. Even with the objection by their families, they do eventually get back together for a relatively happy ending. Also starring Bruce Davison as Tom Oakley, Herman Osorio as Luis, Miguel Castro as Eddie, Tommy De La Cruz as Victor, Soledad St. Hilaire as Mrs. Nunez, Lucinda Jenney as Courtney Oakley and Taryn Manning as Maddy. Dunst really proves herself as a good young actress, it has a good soundtrack, and the story has some interesting moments, this is certainly one to try, a good teenage romantic drama. Worth watching!

This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen. And every time I see a movie with Kirsten Dunst in it I cringe a little bit because I have terrible flashbacks of this waste of a time they call a film. please save yourself the trouble and do NOT see it. It is cliché, predictable from the beginning, and insults everyone in the audience's intelligence level. I'm getting chills just thinking about it. i went in there expecting maybe an entertaining smart movie, at worst a typical teenage flick. however, the problems that Kristen dunst's character goes through just pile up on one another haphazardly and by the time she starts taking drugs and developing an eating disorder instead of caring like one normally would, you groan, laugh, or start throwing your popcorn at the screen yelling at the fool to dump her already.

Over-dramatic and ill-mannered, she pulls a stunt that lands herself and Carlos Nuñez, played by Jay Hernandez, in detention. Carlos is a straight-laced student trying to make it in the world and has no time for trouble. Which is why it makes no sense that he would fall for Nicole. She's not very smart, funny, attractive, or alluring in any way. She gets him in trouble at school, goes to his family's very formal party barely clothed amongst other things. There is no reason for these two to be together.This movie is just a two hour MTV video, made worse by a terrible performance by Dunst, who alternates between smirking and screaming her way through the movie. Hernandez gives a passable performance, but even he doesn't seem to understand why their characters are in love. During the more intimate moments between Carlos and Nicole, Hernandez seems reluctant and unsure. But only when playing opposite Dunst; in his scenes with Bruce Davison, who plays Nicole's father, he seems more relaxed and natural. Sigh. All in all, this is a movie to avoid. */***** "},{"Title":"A movie with an Agenda, no plot, and drags on and on.","Date":"14 October 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  Crazy/Beautiful seemed to be made for the wrong reasons, and I couldn't find any viable plot at all.

Apparently the producers of this film feel no one wants to know in English what it says in this film in Spanish. This is the extent of what you see when you get English Subtitles. That means you miss about 20% of the dialog if you do not speak fluent Spanish. This is obnoxious considering that included is full subtitling for both Spanish and French! So this makes a halfway decent film turn into an annoyance because of bigotry on the account of the producers. Shameful, especially considering that one of the themes of this film is supposedly overcoming racial bigotry, which makes the message cheapen, when it is shown that the studio really doesn't care about it in real life, just the money. Too bad. 4/10 "},{"Title":"another propaganda movie","Date":"20 March 2007","Score":"0 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" If you're a white male living in North America in this day and age THIS is the movie you want to see to see how you're being manipulated into being a second class citizen.Yes, here we go again, another racist movie playing up to Hollywood views of racial purity. Yet another movie where we're all supposed to cheer because a white girl runs off with some excessively sleazy ethnic guy like as if such a sleazy guy is in fact the key to solving her poor emotional problems. A second rate movie to be sure which escaped any harsh words from critics because its trumpeting modern societies view of racial superiority.Watch as the Kirsten Dunst character is sexually harassed on the beach by a gang of Mexicans and yet how the movie makers try to portray this activity as a good thing. OF COURSE its cool for ethnic guys to behave in aggressive manners that white guys are told are completely wrong.So soon after, as per usual with the interracial predatorial movies, Dunst is in the sack having casual sex with a high risk for venereal disease while her pathetic white father cheers her on. Bad parenting? Well of course, but the message is that its good to whore yourself for multiculturalism so bad parenting be damned.The real reason to watch this movie though is to watch the ultra loser white male characters that Hollywood wants white guys to be like. There is one loser who never does anything but stand with his Mexican friend. (The Mexican banging Dunst.) Totally selfless loser which is the creation of Hollywood and so defames white guys that the movie deserves to be sued. No, of course this guy himself could NEVER go after poor lonely screwed up Dunst himself, why that would rain on the Ethnic guys are superior Hollywood racist parade. Finally, look for the all-white party scene. Wow! A Mexican can run right into a party with a bunch of guys who look designed to look like at an Aryan convention and steal a drunken Dunst away from some guy making out with her in a hottub without anyone trying to stop him. Well, of course. Ethnic guys are cool and whitey is a loser.... this movie rates up there with the most offensive movies of all time and should only be watched to monitor the agenda of the Hollywooders who hate 70% of the American population.
