It concerns two cops is Viet Nam investigating a murder of a prostitute and the first suspect is a high ranking Army Officer. The film contains shock after shock, with plenty of plot twists. The dialogue is snappy and the interplay between Dafoe and Hines is excellent. The supporting actors are convincing as well. Kudos to Keith David who plays a paranoid witness to the murder. And one may not soon forget Scott Glenns portrayal as a crazed Officer. The scene in the helicopter is as tense and thrilling as a scene can get. The film is not a preachy summary of the war in Viet Nam but rather just a good mystery and slam bang action. The ending comes around too fast but you have to check it out for yourself.

I was in Vietnam with the Marines north and south of Danang in 1968 and once fantasized about hitching a ride down Highway 1 to see Saigon, no small feat as it is something like 580 road miles. But the highway was full of vehicles during the day and you could always catch a ride. I never did get Saigon during the war, but finally did with a group of war vets in 1994. One of my favorite quips in the movie is when Dafoe turns around and finds some South Viet QCs (MPs) coming toward him and says, We've got mice. That's what we GIs called Viets wearing helmets with QC (Quan Canh) on them. I am now spending several months in Saigon on sort of a temporary assignment, i.e., staying with the in-laws of my Viet wife on a winter break. I would like to see Off Limits again just to critique the city backdrop it used and how realistic it was. I thought this movie could have become a TV mini series but realize it would have been more expensive than China Beach in coming up with SE Asian sets to shoot on. I give it a 7, perhaps too high of a rating, as it goes good on a rainy Saturday afternoon over drinks with friends, especially if they happen to be Vietnam vets.

Want to get a gritty feel for the tension and the ambiguities of the military politics of Nam from the top brass to the lowest levels of the latrine? Follow Dafoe and Hines as CID salt and pepper, good cop-bad cop, along the labyrynthine story of a serial killer U.S. officer, with scrambled eggs on his hat and blood on his hands. The levels of tension are almost unbearable (a rare thing for me!) during the stand-off scenes between the Vietnamese police (wonderful, suspenseful scenes), whose point of view is given fair play and credibility and the amazing helicopter interrogation-murder scene (itself horrendous) only to be topped by Scott Glen putting  an unforgettable sucicide leap as a final argument for his own argument as to his genuineness (and madness that is equal to the war itself.) Whodunnit? Who cares? Sure, it's the least--and the most--obvious character; a fact that is anticlimactic, but does not detract from the more important quality of the film moral ambiguity, cheapness (and richness) of human life, and the overarching sense of a world gone mad. One man (Dafoe) in the guise of a slovenly, hardnosed grunt/cop rises out of the muck and mire to make a solitary single morally redemptive act. Too bad there was no such redemption, no moral order restored by the war itself. A fine film; a strong portayal of the men, madness, and the immorality of that era. Recommended at a 7 level from me.

The film is in essence a who done it police drama, two cops on the streets of Saigon during the war are searching for a high ranking officer who is, erm, offing prostitutes.It is the backdrop of the war that gives the film added substance and lifts it way above average, because we see not only the problems a murder investigation brings, but also the horror of war getting in the way as well. Some damn fine and tidy performances flesh out the characters, with both Gregory Hines & Willem Dafoe as our two stoic and battle weary coppers engaging us from the off, whilst the supporting cast of Fred Ward, Keith David (look out for his dance man!) & Scott Glenn are interestingly watchable; the latter of which who leaves the lasting impression with what has to be the best 5 minutes work he ever did during a brilliant interrogation sequence during a mid-air flight.It's gritty and interesting and deserves to be better known and sought out. It doesn't pull up any trees as regards formula, and it certainly isn't one you will want to go back to time and time again for thrills and spills, but it hits the spot and as the mystery and stifling heat of Vietnam pervades the mood, you will remember watching it long after the credits have rolled. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Goodnight Saigon ... Farewell Moral Values","Date":"9 June 2008","Score":"9 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller, War","Review":" Never heard about Off Limits before when it aired on late Friday night television here in my country, but everything about it instantly appealed to me big time. There's the obscurity status for starters (I'm particularly intrigued by films I never heard about before), the prominent cast (Willem Dafoe, Gregory Hines, Fred Ward, Keith David, Scott Glenn), the period of release (late 80's) and - most of all - the concept in its entirety. As you can derive from the alternate title Saigon, the film is set in Vietnam during the infamous war, but it's definitely not just another epic illustrating the horrible battles in the jungle or the traumatizing impact on its soldiers. Off Limits is first and foremost a genuine cop thriller, set in a hellish environment torn apart through warfare, and an effectively disturbing portrait of the horrible issues caused by American soldiers outside of the battlefields. McGriff and Perkins have the worst jobs in the world, since they're employed as army police officers in Saigon and responsible to investigate the crimes committed by American soldiers. One day they're assigned to investigate the murder of a Vietnamese prostitute who had a child with an American soldier. They quickly discover this isn't the first gruesome crime of its kind, as no less than seven similar cases were reported during the past year and they're clearly the work of a serial killer with a strict modus operandi. The devoted and headstrong duo also discovers that the previous officer prematurely quit his investigation even though he came fairly close to capturing the killer, undoubtedly because several high ranked officers got involved and his own life became endangered. McGriff and Perkins, however, are determined to stop to sadist killer, especially when they receive help from a beautiful and street-wise young novice. Off Limits is a fast-paced, suspense and frequently very violent thriller with a screenplay that is full of misleading twists, false leads and red herrings, like a legitimate and compelling whodunit thriller ought to be. Some sequences are even downright fantastic, for instance the helicopter-interrogation (Scott Glenn is sublime) or the nail-biting scene where the copper duo is surrounded by a mob of furious and vengeful Vietnamese people. Christopher Crowe's direction is tight and consequently surefooted &#150; which is quite remarkable for a debut feature &#150; and his own script is *almost* completely devoid of dreadful clichés and irritating stereotypes. I do emphasize the word 'almost' because a Vietnam movie without mad-raving American officers and/or foul-mouthed Vietnamese prostitutes is practically unthinkable. Dafoe and Hines provide some terrific on screen chemistry, but they certainly aren't your typical witty interracial buddies like Eddie Murphy & Nick Nolte in 48 Hours or Mel Gibson & Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon. They tease and provoke each other all the time, but the atmosphere of the film and the nature of the events are simply to austere to mix with comedy. The film is beautifully shot and has a marvelous soundtrack filled with timeless contemporary songs from James Brown, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Arthur Resnick. Off Limits is a terrific and incomprehensibly overlooked film. If you have the opportunity to watch it, please do so without hesitation.

Buck McGriff (the always excellent Willem Dafoe) and his equally hard-nosed partner Sgt. Albaby Perkins (a sound and convincing performance by Gregory Hines) find themselves in tremendous jeopardy as they investigate a series of vicious Vietnamese prostitute murders in 1968 Saigon. Director Christopher Crowe, who also co-wrote the coarse and engrossing script with Jack Tibeau, relates the gripping story at a steady pace, creates and maintains an uncompromisingly harsh and gritty tone, builds a good deal of tension, and stages the rousing action set pieces with real crackling aplomb. The strong chemistry between Dafoe and Hines really keeps the picture humming; they receive sturdy support from Amanda Pays as streetwise nun Nicole, Fred Ward as their easygoing superior Dix, Scott Glenn as the fearsome and unhinged Colonel Dexter Armstrong, Keith David as surly uncooperative witness Maurice, David Alan Grier as the helpful Rogers, Kay Tong Lim as meddlesome Vietnamese cop Lime Green, and Raymond O'Connor as the paranoid Elgin Flowers. The seedy exotic location, unsparingly profane dialogue, sordid subject matter, startling outbursts of raw brutal violence, and a sizable smattering of nudity give this movie an extra tart'n'tangy kick. David Gribble's glittery cinematography and James Newton Howard's pulsating score are both up to par. A most worthwhile film. "},{"Title":"God I love this town.

Off Limits aka Saigon is a pulpy, but excitingly sweaty and grippingly searing little thriller made the even more relentless by its choice of exotic setting. The essence of the period is captured (some great, fitting soundtrack choices), everything moves at a cracking pace and danger seems to lurk around every corner. Dafoe and Hines perfectly pitch out their broodingly tough persons, spitting out lean, mean and raw dialogues (sometimes darkly humorous) and encountering many heated exchanges. Director Christopher Crowe paints a hard-bitten environment, consisting of live-wire chase scenes, aggressive violence and a paranoid air. The plot moodily unfolds, as it's not much of a mystery but the simple investigation of trying to put the pieces together from scratch, while dealing with constant barriers and cover-ups stopping that from happening. However it does have some unbalanced moments of pure insanity&#x85; mainly when Glenn's character enters the frame. The revelation to who's behind the murders doesn't come as a surprise due to one sequence midway through that's a bit too convenient in the scheme of things not to be overly suspicious. Still it's one hell of a ride.

Two plain-clothes CID men search for an officer who's been slaughtering hookers in the chaos of wartime Saigon. There are touches of Apocalypse Now too, as in the scene at Khe San where an apparently deranged Marine has dug himself a hootch at the end of a long trench, reminiscent of the scene at the bridge in Apocalypse Now.But it just doesn't come together for me.  There is no discernible character development.  Everyone at the end of the movie is pretty much exactly what he or she was at the beginning.  The two CID men finish their job.  The focus is on DaFoe, who practically bursts with principle.  Hines is more than just a sidekick here, but not much more.  Glenn is an obvious psychotic who throws a couple of VC prisoners out of a helicopter and then tells DaFoe and Hines that they are about to ruin his army career by squealing on for being into S&M.  Then he screams, If I killed any prostitutes, I'll stay in this helicopter.  If I DIDN'T kill any prostitutes, I'll jump out of the helicopter.  Then he jumps out.  What was THAT all about?Amanda Pays with her limpet-like lips exudes sensuality.  She has a good moment or two with the CID men when they are questioning her about the murdered hookers.  She looks at the photos and tells them phlegmatically that, yes, this one was into sadism.  This one specialized in oral sex. The officers lined up to wait for her.  And this girl was a prostitute and put on lesbian shows for the men at a bar called The Pink Pussy.  Meanwhile the two investigators are squirming with discomfort and rolling their eyes at the ceiling.  She takes them to the bar where a nude stripper is performing and punishes them even more by insisting that they not wait backstage to question the witness but take a table in front instead.

But she's one of those movie nuns who is allowed to strip down to her shift and be attracted to one of the men because she had not yet taken her final vows.There are so many pegs here to hang good things on but they really don't show up.  The treatment of sociopolitical issues is perfunctory.  The characters are immutable.  The final revelation comes as no surprise -- at least it didn't to me.

But the problem with Saigon, is it does give too much away, in it's intelligent but self conscious script. We have great action, well shot, some of it quite thrilling, and scary. Fred Ward is totally unlike Fred Ward here, as a colonel who has his own demons. It's the best stuff I've ever seen from this guy.

If you want to see either Willam Defoe or Scott Glenn in a movie masterpiece rent PLATOON or APOCALYPSE NOW instead  "},{"Title":"Average crazed killer flic","Date":"3 February 2004","Score":"1 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Thriller, War","Review":"  Pretty decent offering featuring a couple of G.I. MP's who try to solve a string of brutal prostitute murders. After a while it was plain who the killer was. One part that just didn't play was the car bombing I don't think yelling get down would save anybody in this case.  "}]
