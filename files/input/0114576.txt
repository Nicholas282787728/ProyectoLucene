[{"Title":"One of the best Die Hard clones","Date":"14 October 2000","Score":"42 out of 46 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  After the success of Die Hard there have been many movie clones of that great action film. There was Die Hard on a Ship (Under Siege), Die Hard on a Train (Under Siege 2), and Die Hard on a Bus (Speed), just to name a few. Sudden Death can be described as either Die Hard on the Ice, Die Hard at a Hockey Game or Die Hard in an Arena. You pick. Technically you could put all three titles into this movie and it'll still be pretty much the same thing. However, Sudden Death is one of the better Die Hard clones. It's an exciting movie about terrorists taking over the Pittsburgh Civic Arena where the decisive seventh game of the Stanley Cup Finals between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Chicago Blackhawks is being played. However there's a little difference here. The only people who know that hostages have taken over are the people in the VIP box (which includes the Vice President), the Secret Service men outside the arena, and an arena fire marshall who's two little kids are attending the game. The 17,000-plus fans attending the game have no idea whats really going on. That fire marshall is played by Belgian action star Jean-Claude Van Damme. I've not been a big fan of Van Damme's films, but Sudden Death is easily his best movie to date. Van Damme plays Darren McCord, the fire marshall who finds out something's wrong when his little daughter is taken to the VIP box as a hostage after witnessing a killing. When McCord finds out what's going on, he does precisely what Bruce Willis did in Die Hard, takes on the terrorists all by himself. The lead bad guy is portrayed by Powers Boothe in a frightening performance. He may not be quite as effective as Alan Rickman's villain in Die Hard, but Boothe does a good job at being mean. Van Damme is also very good too (especially in one scene where he poses as the Penguins goalie to hide out from the bad guys who were chasing him). He's much better here than he was in Timecop, teaming again with Timecop director Peter Hyams. The action scenes are splendid (both the gunplay and the action during the game), and the suspense has you on the edge. Sudden Death has a few silly moments here and there, but since this movie is such a good thrill ride, you won't care. This movie deserved to be a big hit at the box office and wasn't. I'll never understand why.***1/2 (out of four)  "},{"Title":"Powers Gives Boost To Film","Date":"20 August 2006","Score":"28 out of 32 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" I found this to be a very interesting action with with Powers Boothe fun to watch as the main villain, thanks to his dialog and no-nonsense approach. At least he wasn't one of those talk-first, shoot-maybe-later clichés from the world of film. The hockey scenes in here are realistic, too. However, the rest of the film doesn't exactly exhibit realism lots of hokey stuff in here, too. At the end, the action really gets carried away and brings the rating down on this to a manageable 7. Otherwise, it would be a minimum of 8 just for the entertainment value alone.After a slow start, it picks up when Boothe enters the movie. Then it never lets up. If you want a pure hour of action, this is it. There is no female lead in this movie, so you get no romance nor gratuitous sex scenes, which is a bit unusual. It's a straight crime story.One note unless things have been changed, I was disappointed my DVD did not offer a widescreen version.

Jean-Claude Van Damme would be near the top of my list of actors that I only admire although I've seen a few films where he has his name is on the poster.Sudden Death is the second film that Van Damme has starred in with photographer/director Peter Hyams (End of Days, Timecop) is at the helm.This film was based on an actual story by Karen Baldwin and is adapted into the story by Gene Quintano.The movie takes place at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena in Pittsburgh where the Chicago Blackhawks and the Pittsburgh Penquins are about to take the ice for the last game of the Stanley Cup finals.  Van Damme's character, Darren McCord, takes his son and daughter to the game.  As usual, the arena is packed with fans and the Vice President of the U.S. has come to see the game as well.  Unfortunately, Joshua Foss (Powers Boothe), a demented terrorist and a small band of terrorists take control of the Owner's box where the V.P. and several people.  Foss demands that he wants a billion dollars and how he wants to use it puzzles me.  However, at the end of each period, if his demand isn't met, Foss shoots someone and if the deal isn't done at the end of the game.  The arena is blown sky high with several explosives that are set all over the arena.Boothe is good here and he makes the threat very real, which is key to making any thriller.  He also shows some wit and in one particular scene, the Vice President curiously asks Foss What kind of lunatic are you? Foss responds - The best kind.What draws McCord into the situation is when his daughter is taken up to the Owner's box.  From there on, the movie manages to make the excitement to be interesting.  One example would be the fight scenes that McCord has with a couple of thugs in the kitchen at two seperate times.  Just about every prop is used from the meat slicer to the bone, which goes through one of the neck of a terrorist.  Fun and yucky isn't it?The last half of the film is just about entertaining as the first half is.  I'm undecided if Sudden Death would make the best thriller that involves a sports event and terrorists since John Frankenheimer's Black Sunday.  Van Damme and Boothe are both good here.

This is not Oscar material. It's a typical hostage movie similar to the Die Hard series. There are some pretty decent action sequences and some that just don't plain make any sense and, after you see them, you will be left kinda confused. Having said that, this is a good movie. The best part about this movie is, surprisingly, the bad guy. Powers Boothe plays the lead terrorist and he plays it well. At times you root for him because he plays the part so well. Unfortunately, it's hard to root against this guy because of his wise-ass attitude, but some of his quotes are memorable and quite amusing. (Example To the vice president I voted for you. I really did. It's your sincerity and compassion. However there may be a need to kill someone else. Now we're gonna make this work or we're gonna die trying!)

Unfortunately several people, including Van Damme's daughter as well as the vice-president, are taken hostage by a deranged CIA member and his team of suited up goons. Their plan is to kill one hostage each quarter if their continuously outrageous demands for absurd amounts of money are not met. If they still don't have their money by the end of the game, the arena and all of the people inside will be detonated. Van Damme ends up having to do battle with these creeps while trying to disarm the bombs. Eventually when the game nears it's end he also ends up having to do everything in his power to get the hockey game to continue.This is easily one of the most intense and nerve-wracking Van Damme films. Obviously it's just another Die Hard-ripoff, but it has more to offer than most Die Hard-ripoffs that came out in the 90s. For starters, the villains in this are real villains. They have absolutely no qualms with killing any innocent people, and they do it about as casually and as constantly as a real bad guy should. A lot of people get killed in this film, and a good portion of the victims are innocent bystanders. Powers Boothe is actually pretty damn scary! The first third of the film has a pretty high bodycount, and the bloodshed starts off almost immediately. Sure, the villains aren't as sadistic as the villains in, say, the second Die Hard film, but I don't think that anyone is going to dispute that these bad guys are pretty bad. One thing this film does exceptionally well, however, is allow the action set-pieces to be implemented in some pretty cool ways. There's a fight scene in the kitchen involving a team mascot gone mad in which all the deadly and dangerous hazards become tools. There's a lot of really slick gore and some really shocking moments of bodily harm that make this film a lot more memorable. What really makes the film work, however, is the final act where things get down to the wire and it becomes all about survival. I won't spoil what happens, but the last few action set-pieces are spectacular in their creativity and in their energy.Van Damme also does a fine job as usual as the hero who ends up having to do everything by himself. He shows about as much charisma as expected for the role, but since he's playing a father he remembers to keep it in check a lot of the time too. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but don't expect a lot of moments of sly little comments like you would find in Bloodsport. I don't mind so much either way, it's just that this isn't the goofy Van Damme that was in Double Impact, but it's not the hardened stonefaced loner in Hard Target. This Van Damme lies somewhere in between those, though leaning more toward the Hard Target Van Damme. As long as he isn't the loudly shrieking crucified idiot that he was in Cyborg, I don't have any problem. I think one thing that made this a little more unique is the fact that he's trying to rescue his child rather than rescue a woman who simply knows too much. This helped make the film much more simple to digest and it also gave it that little emotional kick that never hurts in a good action film.I like my action films to be raw and gut-wrenching, and Van Damme's films usually deliver the goods. Sudden Death is definitely no exception. It's an intense and explosive film that is entertaining as hell and has plenty of good shocks. It's not a good film by any means, but if you're looking for action that is brutal, Sudden Death is easily one of the more entertaining films of the 90s, and plus there aren't a lot of films where a bad guy is killed by getting shoved into a dishwasher.

Most aspects of the story-line have been influenced by earlier hostage thrillers, especially Die Hard, the mother of them all.Take for example the scene where the foolish FBI decide to take matters into their own hands and send men into the stadium, strictly against the orders of the villain, quite well cast as 'Powers' Boothe. As they all run in from separate doors, their is a man sitting behind several surveillance cameras of the outer stadium, relaying their actions through his walkie-talkie to Boothe. Like the black man in Die Hard with his 'all was quiet on Christmas Eve, except 3 swat team members entering from the front' line.Some of the action scenes are well crafted, like Van Damme's entrance into the VIP box at the end, but most of the fights have far too many speedy cuts to make them enjoyable, instead they are just ultra-violent. If nothing else, some of Jean-Claude's moments of glory are highly comical, especially his facial expressions, which are completely OTT e.g. after saying 'come and get me' over the phone. Other notable bits of unintentional humour are;1. Van Damme's ''educated guesses'' at where the bombs could be within the stadium, all of which are inch perfect, naturally. 2.The way in which Van Damme, THE FIREMAN, diffuses all bombs with ease.3. One scene where the producers must have run out of dosh as it seems they couldn't afford to over-dub sound effects and old Claude has to, hilariously, make them himself with a throaty 'HUUGH'!! (during the 'sharp object up the arm' manoeuvre)So, all humour apart, this is a better than average flick which will keep you entertained due to its fast pace and moments of genuine tension. Just don't expect something as good as Die Hard, Under Siege, or Speed.Overall Rating 7/10  "},{"Title":"Van Damme had to do a Die Hard clone","Date":"9 December 2013","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Right from the beginning I could see that this movie was going to be a Die Hard clone, which is not surprising because Die Hard was a very successful movie and created a trend that followed on behind it. The action in the movie was good but the plot seriously sucked. Basically there were so many holes in the plot that it created a movie that you only go and see for Van Damme, and I don't think that he is that great anyway. If you are wanting to see Van Damme's moves, then this is not the movie to see them in. In fact, if you simply want to see good fighting, hire out a Hong Kong video - there generally tends to be much better moves in them.The vice president is going to the Ice Hockey finals and some guy, the movie really never actually explains who he is, only that he knows the government security operations very well, holds him hostage so that he can force the president to remove money from frozen bank accounts. The problem is that they grab a nosey little girl who turns out to be Van Damme's daughter, and that brings him into it.Van Damme's character is a fireman who quit after a girl died in his arms. Now, the thing that annoyed me is that they showed this part, and it really had nothing to do with the movie. It could have just as easily been explained afterwards than to show it. I think that it would have been much better for the plot line if they spent some time describing who Foss, the antagonist, was. They dropped hints but they never actually went as far as outlining everything. Some might say that it is not important because this is an action movie, but I think it is. It makes for a very poor movie to simply disregard plot for action.Sudden Death is a better Van Damme movie and I enjoyed it. All but this stupid sporting commentator in the booth, but then this is what you expect from commentators. I generally do not watch sports because first I find them boring, but mostly because the commentators are prone to say the stupidest things. These guys tried to make themselves look tough, when they really just didn't think about what they were saying. Actually, it was even worse because it was scripted.I liked it, and I am sure Van Damme fanatics would love it. Personally I would rather go back to the original Die Hard. That is a finely crafted movie.

What they don't know is a group of terrorists have taken over the arena, wired the entire building with explosives, and captured the Vice-President who was attending the game. Only until McCords' daughter is taken hostage does McCord realize what is going on. Now the lives of thousands of people depend on a man with everything to lose and only his wits to save the day.This movie was made back in the day when action movies were not afraid to still be action movies. It definitely earns its R rating and is not shy of depicting the violence that occurs. Everyone from old men to several women are killed in violent ways as the terrorists put their plan in to action. Setting the action around a hockey game that depends on the outcome of who scores a goal and when they do it is crucial to the story and the audience is always reminded of whats going on. This was one of two movies Van-Damme would star in that was directed by Peter Hyams and like Carpenter & Russell, they prove they are a good match for some awesome action. It's sad that action films don't take any risks any more and have to be toned down as not to offend the easily offended audience today. If you want a classic action flick back when Van-Damme was at his peak then check out Sudden Death, if you want something else well there are those Transformers movies.

I deliberately state top three, because personally I'm also a big fan of Death Warrant and Hard Target even though I might be the only one. Sudden Death is a typical Die Hard clone, like there were far too many of them throughout the nineties, but it's one of the chosen few that are actually great fun and closely approaching the quality level of the actual Die Hard sequels (not the one and only original, of course). This accomplishment is largely thanks to the craftsmanship of director Peter Hyams and &#x96; also typical for major action blockbusters &#x96; the presence of a genuinely evil villain you just hate to love. In this particular case it's Powers Booth who depicts his terrorist/robber character continuously straight-faced and seemingly emotionless regardless of who he kills or what challenge overcomes him. Booth and his equally evil platoon of accomplices invade the Vice Presidents' lounge during the prestigious Stanley Cup ice-hockey finale and demand for a whole lot of money to be transferred to secret bank accounts all across the globe. If there aren't sufficient transfers at the end of each game period, Booth kills off one of the hostages. In case the whole sum isn't transferred at the end of the game, he threatens to blow up the entire stadium with everyone in it. Luckily for the thousands of (unaware) spectators, the tough former fireman JCVD is the arena's responsible fire safety inspector and Power Booth made the terrible mistake of taking his young daughter hostage. Sudden Death guarantees adrenalin-rushes from start to finish, with violent shootouts as well as brutal hand combat battles, a suspenseful race-against-the-clock aspect, a bit of disaster-movie mayhem near the finale and a handful of cool (if predictable) plot twists.

Really he didn't fall away like some other 80s and 90s action stars, but actually made some decent features even if they were straight to video. Anyhow Sudden Death would be directed (and photographed) by Peter Hyams, who previously in the year before guided Van Damme in Timecop. What we get is a fashionably conventional, but tautly exciting siege standoff like something in the sorts of Die Hard, although done during a sporting spectacle meaning a stadium load of victims (at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena) are virtually unaware of the danger. Van Damme is the only one who can stop these terrorists who are holding the American vice-president for ransom in a private box. These guys mean business. Powers Boothe is terrifically commanding and genuinely threatening. While quite suave and quick with a witty response, he's one you wouldn't want to get on his bad side as there's no hesitations in the way he gets about things. Van Damme's ex-fire-fighter character (who is scared by a past incident) gets involved when his daughter is kidnapped and he goes about trying to spoil the terrorist's party by disabling their bombs while also taking some of them out. The expansive set-up might have been done to death and is elaborately plotted, but Hyams perfectly delivers the martial arts combat of its star (where can you see Van Damme take on the Pittsburgh Penguins' mascot) and the suspense of the situation to go with it. While slow and steady to start, where it feels played down suddenly becomes an assault on the senses with its busy pacing and bruising, brutal and unsparing violence that builds up to a heart stopping finale.

I don't think Vandamme is that bad or that he can be compared with Seagal or Norris. Vandamme is obviously better than them.

Therefore, Darren must not only subdue the terrorists, but postpone the game and send it to overtime.....Oh yes, the film is silly, and full of gaping plot holes, but for heavens sake, it's a really fun movie with a really good performance from Van Damme (his relationship with his children is spot on), and Powers Boothe, looking like he's having the time of his life as the villain.It's a shame though that the movie was released at the time it was. The Die Hard in a.....

The basic premise is very appealing but there are differences that cause logical problems. An arena has too many entrances and it should be a lot easier to sneak people in. A big event like this should have a ton of security already inside the arena. It would never boil down to one unarmed fire marshal. There's a war outside but the audience inside has no clue. I do remember mobile phones back in the day. It's also very annoying that Van Damme can't seem to pick up any of the guns. It gets too ridiculous when he goes in to play goaltender.

But the next year, when he did Sudden Death, his popularity at the box office started to decline. While the movie was not an outright flop at the box office, it did perform below expectations. It may have been that the action genre itself was starting to lose popularity at the North American box office. It also may have been that the Die Hard genre - which this movie rips off - was starting to be old hat. But the movie itself has some faults that may explain why audiences weren't eager to see it. Van Damme's character is pretty thin, from us not learning too much about him to the fact that he hardly appears in the first half hour. There are also some continuity gaps and key happenings that are not properly explained. Also, the movie has a nasty streak that rears its head a number of times during the film, which may have turned off even, ahem, die hard action fans.Despite problems such as those, the movie does have some positive attributes. It looks great, with expert cinematography by Peter Hyams (who also directed) and top notch production values, including some great old school special effects. There aren't any boring spots, and some scenes do have some genuine excitement. This doesn't beat the original Die Hard, of course, but if you are REALLY wanting to see this formula again, this particular take is better than a lot of others.

Sudden Death is a rather passable Die Hard clone. It goes through the motions without offering anything new for the fans, unless you happen to be a hockey fan, in which you won't be disappointed because the film shows a fairly good game during the course of the film.

Is the second Van Damme movie that was directed from Peter Hyams and a decent action Die Hard movie, definitely of one of my action fun favorite Van Damme movies and mostly because I love Die Hard movies and a Die Hard style flicks like Sudden Death. It is a really shame how underrated this action movie flick is. I never get tired of it or bored with it. This is the second time I actually recognize that Van Damme's character is a Canadian is this action Die Hard Flick. The first time his character was a Canadian was in Death Warrant when he played a Mounty cop. In here he plays a Canadian disgrace Fireman now turning a fire building inspector who takes on a group of terrorists holding the Vice President and others hostages including his daughter during the seventh game of the NHL Stanley Cup finals. Still Van Damme's decent action movie in my opinion.Terror Goes Into Over-Time Sudden Death is a 1995 American action film starring Jean-Claude Van Damme as Darren McCord, a Pittsburgh firefighter who during a Stanley Cup finals game finds himself trying to save his daughter and the Vice-President, who have been taken hostage by a team of terrorists led by former government operative Joshua Foss (Powers Boothe). The film was directed by Peter Hyams from a story written by the wife of the then owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins. The majority of the film was shot during the 1994&#x96;95 NHL lockout in the Civic Arena, the actual arena of the Pittsburgh Penguins. That is the basic plot it is about a an ex fireman fighting terrorist in the hockey arena. I liked Whittni Wright and Ross Malinger who played Emily and Taylor, Darren's children, they were great.This movie how ever has a lot of mayor problems, problems that I do have with the film. Which is also one of the reasons it wasn't my favorite Van Damme movie as a child. I think this is the first time I do not see Van Damme's martial arts and his spine kicks. I hated the twist! Dorian Harewood should have played the good guy and not the bad guy at the end. The fight choreographer still has horribly done fight doubles/stand-ins during the fights, which are very noticeable and take away from the fight scenes. You can easily tell, that this is not Van Damme in so many of the fight scenes. The pacing is still not that good. Too many useless stuff like the cops outside who weren't interesting. The 'good luck' that the main character got throughout (the gun shooting but Oh, it's Empty, the game going into Sudden Death at the last couple of seconds so this No Explosion) and etc. made me Call Bullshit quite a few times, making that kind of stuff not enjoyable, and this took me out of the flick quite a few times. A couple of nice explosions and a good role by Van Damme & Powers Boothe, doesn't make a great movie'.I like this movie but honestly I think Double Impact and even Kickboxer are better movie than this. I like the Hockey game and That Van Damme's character does everything in his power to safe the hostages including all people in the hockey arena. But personally to me this movie did not felt a real Die Hard movie. I think Die Hard is still better movie. A good ideas was also used in this movie including nice shootouts. The helicopter crashed in the hockey arena with Joshua Foss in it. Van Damme's character realized right away what happened and try to spoiled the terrorists plans. I like that he was looking for the bombs. I like that the movie was set in Pittsburgh and not New York or Washington D.C./ Those are one of the reasons why I like this movie and the rating, this movie get's by me is a 7, the ideas in this movie very terribly.

To help show he's a good dad, he takes his two kids, Tyler and Emily (Malinger and Wright) to see their beloved Penguins play the Chicago Blackhawks in a big hockey game for the Stanley Cup. As it turns out, the Vice President of the United States (Barry) is also a big hockey fan and in attendance, and a gang of baddies led by the maniacal but smooth Joshua Foss (Boothe) threaten to kill the Vice-Prez, and blow up the arena with all 17,000 people inside if they don't get the money they're asking for. As if that wasn't enough, they've kidnapped Emily and are holding her with the other hostages in one of the luxury boxes. And Hallmark (Harewood) of the secret service doesn't seem to be of much help. So it's up to Darren McCord to try and dismantle all the bombs, save his family, save the Vice-Prez, save the hockey fans, and stop Foss - all single-handedly. Can he do it? The now-classic 90's theme of DieHardInA movies is perhaps never better exemplified than here. Tired of accented and/or quirky baddies over-running water treatment plants, biochemical weapons labs, schools, hotels, train tunnels, malls, planes, dams, rock concerts, computer research facilities, buildings, Beverly Hillses, more buildings, and beauty contests (Lethal Tender , Deadly Outbreak, Detention, Crackerjack, Crackerjack 2, Irresistible Force, Strategic Command, Terminal Rush, Command Performance, Virtual Assassin, The Alternate, The Taking of Beverly Hills, The Last Hour, and No Contest, respectively), this time they try a hockey rink. Powers Boothe steals the show as the evildoer who looks like a dapper Oliver Stone. The whole thing is very competently and professionally directed, and it's standard action fare for the most part, with a few standout scenes and creatively-staged deaths that help endear the movie to the audience.The fact that it's the Vice President that's in trouble certainly threw us for a loop. But then again, what does the Vice President do, anyway? That's why it's good that Van Damme had kids (and an arena of self-described Puckheads) to save, because if they had shot the VP, those stakes just aren't high enough. Also, it's good that they were able to get real teams, players, announcers and staff. That added some nice realism, instead of some made-up team like the Pittsburgh....Powers or something. (Though Boothe surely would have enjoyed that). Plus you know one of the baddies is evil because he has a terrorist earring, and what we dubbed evil popcorn makes an appearance.Because it was the 90's, there are some great fashions on display, a character is playing Doom on a PC, Tyler has a mini Super Soaker, and McCord's son is named Tyler. It's a totally 90's name (heh heh). There was a time, not so long ago, that movies like this went to the theater. It seems hard to believe, but it's true. Sudden Death is certainly enjoyable, and will remind you of the action boom of the 90's right before it all went DTV.

As dictated by Die Hard back in 1988, the film must be set in a specific location (skyscraper, naval vessel, airport, etc) and have a lone-wolf hero out-manned and out-gunned by the baddies who have taken said location over. Of course, the professionals will try to save the day but they'll bodge it, leaving it to our hero to save the day in a dramatic and explosive manner before rescuing his loved ones (who are naturally held hostage somehow) and becoming a better person at the end of it. That could probably describe perhaps 75% of all action movies released since then and I'm afraid that Jean-Claude Van Damme isn't going to start improvising with the formula. This may be as predictable as a season of Scottish Premier League football but it's entertaining enough without stretching its boundaries or your imagination too far.Van Damme plays Darren McCord, a traumatised fireman now reduced to acting as fire marshal at the home of the Pittsburgh Penguins ice hockey team. Which is handy when the final game of the Stanley Cup rolls into town along with the Vice President (Raymond J. Barry) to watch the game. McCord takes his two kids along (Ross Malinger and Whittni Wright) but trouble isn't far away - a crazed terrorist (Powers Boothe) takes control of the stadium and the executive box when the VP is held hostage along with other dignitaries. It's soon up to McCord to take the fight to the terrorists while outside the stadium, the police effort led by Secret Service agent Hallmark (Dorian Harewood) struggles to get involved...I could go on detailing the plot but I reckon that you can fill in the blanks yourself. Sudden Death has little spark of originality or imagination, remaining content to tick off each genre cliché in order until the inevitable ending. I hasten to add that this is a decent enough action movie - certainly, you know what to expect from JCVD and he doesn't disappoint in the fight scenes. As a hero, though, he remains pretty vacant and is thoroughly outshone by Boothe (when asked what sort of lunatic he is, he replies The best kind!) who displays more charisma than Van Damme could ever hope to muster. Ignoring the minutiae of the plot which, frankly, is pretty tenuous at best then this is the sort of guys-night-in garbage that you could happily rent and not feel short-changed at. Action veterans, however, might be a little annoyed. For me, the best moment was the fight between Van Damme and a seven-foot-tall cuddly penguin in a kitchen which had more thought put into it than the rest of the film put together. Naturally, they stumble into everything remotely dangerous in a kitchen - meat slicer, deep fat fryer, dishwasher, tenderiser, you name it. But from there, the action seems to come in fits and starts when McCord begins trying to track the bombs planted in the stadium.It may strive for comparisons to Die Hard but I'm afraid that Sudden Death felt like a cheap knock-off of the real thing, much like Steven Seagal's Under Siege did. It knows what action fans want and it provides all the fist-pumping, roundhouse-kicking nonsense that they could ask for. But for me, there is a strange lack of quality to it - there are no surprises in store for anyone other than the fact that nobody gets hit with a skate and there isn't even a love interest to provide some much-needed eye candy amid the ricocheting bullets and ill-lit steamy pipe-work (which is bathed in a red light for reasons I cannot possibly fathom other than it makes Van Damme look hard). I also didn't like the ending which felt and looked badly written, executed and just didn't feel right. Van Damme has made better films than this - Universal Soldier remains my favourite of his while Timecop is also held in high esteem by fans of the Muscles From Brussels. But Sudden Death is an adequate enough time-passer but not likely to change the world any time soon. I was always more into American Football anyway...

He wasn't my favourite hero but he was always good for action. I thought I remembered Sudden Death being one of my favourites so I was anxious to watch it again. I'm glad I did because man was it bad. I was completely entertained but now that I've seen so many more movies and become something of a connoisseur I can see all the ridiculously huge plot holes with a movie like this. I mean any good action film requires you to suspend some belief but I'm talking ridiculous gaping plot holes that are just ignored. How is that terrorists completely overtake a stadium during the biggest sporting event ever, blow up cars outside the stadium, have massive gunfights and perform other acts of terrorism without anyone inside the stadium ever having any idea? Its ludicrous. This is only one example but its a major one. The acting for the most part is wooden and even Van Damme who at least has a strong chemistry on screen just doesn't really come alive in this one. Still with those downsides the film is still fun and entertaining and still has some worthy action scenes.Many will poke fun at Jean-Claude Van Damme for his acting abilities but he was a nineties king for a brief moment. He was a martial arts/action superstar and this seems almost primed for him. The unfortunate part is they misuse him. He hardly does any martial arts and just seems so out of place. His character has no development and doesn't really get the chance to be as charismatic as other heroes in similar films. Powers Boothe actually steals the show in a lot of ways. He is a fantastic lead villain right up there with a great Die Hard villain. Boothe has the look and the delivery and has a cold blooded character not to be messed with. The final show down is epic enough and it is sort of a cool concept but when Boothe's villain finally meets his end it is rather campy but suits the film. Raymond J. Barry also is quite good but sadly underused as the Vice-President of The United States. Whittni Wright and Ross Malinger deserve honourable mention as they both do a good job as Van Damme's children who find themselves in danger. Dorian Harewood is decent as Hallmark but I'm not sure his entire purpose in the film and despite getting one of the cooler death scenes his character feels awkward in the grand scheme of things.Certainly director Peter Hyams is no stranger to a good action film. He worked with Van Damme previously on Timecop and has done a handful of decent to really good action flicks but his best work is usually in sci-fi. This is not his best work. Essentially this is another Die Hard type rip off but its lacking the heart and the smart script that is necessary to make it really something. As the rumour goes this film was originally written as an action/martial arts spoof film and ultimately I think that is what it ended up being. For all the bad I've said you can't deny its nineties classic status. Its a terrific concept to have the lone hero suddenly have to protect his children, the Vice President and thousands of hockey fans from an insane terrorist at Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals IN Sudden Death Overtime. I don't understand why they made him a fireman as opposed to a police officer which would have made far more sense and helped with some of the glaring plot holes. So basically if you can really let go of logic and sense and just sit back and enjoy a silly action flick then you'll be entertained and find this amusing. A great piece of film making it isn't but I suppose that isn't its goal. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Never takes a breath!

I have seen some reviews saying there isn't enough action. That's not the case. Did I forget that you also have to add MacGyver? Van Damme isn't a Martial Arts expert in this one. He's just a Ex-Fireman who had a hard time and is frustrated. He doesn't have guns. He has his wits, random objects, last minute kill ideas and balls. He just scraps and scrapes his way through Henchmen. All that and you get the rarity of Hockey being showcased in a movie without Swayze shaving some guys junk, America beating Commies or Paul Newman. Must Watch.

And I have to say, most of them are pretty amazing.Van Damme plays ex-firefighter Darren McCord who, during game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals, is forced to save not only the Vice-President but also his own daughter from vicious terrorists who want what else, money.Van Damage's character does ridiculous things from disarming bombs (he's a firefighter) swinging from the rafters of the Melon Arena, to playing goalie for the Pittsburgh Penguins!!! Now that is amazing. It happens for no reason really, but it does, and it is great. Van Damme even fights the evil Penguins mascot in the Arena kitchen, doing such ridiculous things as choking it with pepper, shoving its hand in a steaming fryer (even though the kitchen is supposed to be shut down. Ludicrous, yet entertaining is a great way to describe this film.Van Damme plays Van Damme thrilling with his kicks and punches. And Powers Boothe plays a pretty damn funny villain with such lines as I think we can all agree that the mayor's wife has been most annoying.You'll definitely laugh, be thrilled and excited. I can't say you'll be blown away, but Van Damme and action fans should love this. 7 of 10. See it.

That was over 10 years ago I actually enjoyed the film very much, as I do with most Peter Hyams films. As a Hyams film, this film is not your typical Van Damme action flick where he is getting his arse kicked and then he makes a few slick moves and gets the upper hand... In this film, The McCord character played by Van Damme is a real person, not a cardboard cutout- Who has two very cute kids.The action of this film is based around three periods in a Penguins Hockey Game, and each period of action is bumped up intensity until ultimately the game goes into Sudden Death Overtime - Which is not only an appropriate name for the film, but also appropriate for what happens to the crook played by Powers Booth.This character played by Boothe is also not a cardboard cutout... According to McCord's daughter, he is the Meanest Man in the World The fighting scenes flow smoothly and are not typical Van Damme kicks and punches... In this film Van Damme uses his wits as much as his feet and fists... and his kids also participate in bringing down the bad guys, and so it is a group effort.Regardless of how well this film ever did in the box office, it is actually a highly enjoyable film that keeps you interested all through. There are no slow spots, and there are plenty of little twists, that are difficult to detect... So when they are revealed, you are kicking yourself for not seeing it beforehand.Even if this film is considered minor Hyams/Van Damme, any Hyams film is interesting, and Van Damme and Hyams seem to work well together.

By-the-numbers plot, though nicely executed action scenes. Yes, the whole van-Damme-being-a-goalie subplot is on the verge of parody and should've been left out. Still, what's worth of paying attention to is the fact that all the stunts are practical, except few blue-screen manipulations. That's all that action junkies need.Plus, a good cast. I thought Powers Boothe was effective and menacing enough to pull off the villain's role. And good old Jean Claude was at the top of his game, proving he's a capable action star. Too bad that he's making some B-movie rubbish, because obviously van Damme could've been more than he's become.So, if good action is all you need, you might want to give Sudden Death a chance. A good and overall engaging action movie from Peter Hyams, director of Timecop and End of Days, also good even though underrated action films.

Okay, admittingly Sudden Death is a Die Hard clone, but it is a very entertaining one at that.Peter Hyams, who I believe is one of the most underrated directors of all time, delivers an action packed movie that rivals Die Hard in many ways. First of all, I liked the fact that Jean-Claude Van Damme actually has to put himself into dangerous situations in order to avoid dying, much like Bruce Willis did. By that I mean the terrorists are not directly responsible for every time Van Damme is in peril (hanging from the stadium roof, taking the place of the goalie, etc.) That was a neat angle that the creators of Under Siege and Passenger 57 left out completely.Plus Powers Boothe gives a vicious performance as the head terrorist that rivals his role in Tombstone. Boothe's character is an awesome foil for Van Damme, and he really knows how to chew the scenary properly (Whereas Tommy Lee Jones in Under Siege pretty much just does a 'Jack Nicholson' throughout the film, not that I'm complaining ;) ) Only Alan Rickman in Die Hard gives a better performance, but that's only because his cocky British accent suggests that he thinks he is actually a much better person than the people he associates with, a characteristic that makes his role only the more memorable.Great visual effects throughout the film too, like the helicopter falling through the roof and Van Damme swinging his way over to the owner's box to free his daughter (and the Vice President!)I'm not naive enough to say this is an excellent movie, but it is definitely better than just serviceable. A real good attempt by Van Damme to do something different.And besides, it's neat to see Van Damme beat up a kung fu chick wearing a penguin mascot costume and burn a terrorist's face off with a squirt gun full of lighter fluid. lol8/10 Everybody has a good time, and all the bad guys are pushing up daisies in the end.

If you're looking for a straightforward actioner and have no reservations about JCVD being in the leading role, you could do worse than check this one out I suppose.  I haven't changed my mind about JC being one of the worst actors at work in the industry today, but his annoyance level was minimal here due to there always being something else going on to distract you from his 'IKEA furniture' quality acting.  The setpieces are handled well by director Hyams, who's only ever dangerous if your expectations are high and you attach him to a project with some initial potential (End of Days, The Relic) He's perfect for a generic little 'one-man-saves-the-day' flick starring the 'Muscles from Brussels'.    The concept of a hockey game is actually incorporated into the story to some degree, rather than just being the backdrop for some fisticuffs, and Powers Booth does some sterling work as the megalomaniacal villain of the piece.  Worth a look on a slow night as long as you're perfectly aware what to expect; changing the foundations of movie-making and statuettes of little golden men definitely NOT being applicable here...

In true John McClane style, loose cannon McCord proves to be a right royal pain in the ass for the bad guys, his ingenuity and fighting prowess allowing him to whittle down their numbers until the inevitable face-off with head terrorist Joshua Foss (played with gusto by Powers Boothe) atop the Arena's impressive dome.Sticking close to the original Die Hard blueprint, Sudden Death is predictable stuff, even going so far as having the despicable Foss hold McCord's loved ones hostage; but although the film doesn't ever attempt to break new ground, there's still plenty of fun to be had with the well-choreographed mayhem, which includes a brutal smack-down against a team mascot in a kitchen full of dangerous appliances, a thrilling fist fight high above the ice rink, the unforgettable sight of McCord swinging through the air on a lighting cable carrying home-made explosives, and Foss plummeting through the arena's open roof trapped inside a helicopter.

Foss demands that the Government pay him millions of dollars or he will execute his hostages one by one & eventually blow the arena up & everyone inside. By chance McCord discovers what has happened & takes it upon himself to stop Foss & prevent him killing the Vice President, thousands of innocent spectators & his children...Directed by Peter Hymas who was also the director of photography one has to say Sudden Death is one of my favourite action flicks from the 90's. You know I have always liked JCVD & think he's made some great films, yes that's right I just said I think JCVD has made some great films since I truly believe that. He isn't the greatest actor of all time but he does at least try, he has always kept himself in shape & certainly makes for a plausible action hero & most of his films have something about them. From his early low budget roots in Bloodsport (1988) & Kickboxer (1989) which were fun films to his big budget Hollywood hey day with entertaining films like Universal Soldier (1992), Hard Target (1993) & Timecop (1994) to his more recent output like the interesting Replicant (2001) & In Hell (2003) which deserved more than to go straight to video. For my money Sudden Death ties with Hard Target as JCVD's best film, sure it's an unashamed Die Hard (1988) rip-off but if you can get over that & take it for what it is it's great action packed entertainment all the way. The script by Gene Quintano could have easily been made as a Die Hard film & not looked out of place, there's the cold hearted bad guy, there's the plan to take control of some location & cut it off from the outside world, there's the lone ranger style hero who has to do it all on his own against the odds while his family get caught up in the situation which makes things personal for him, there's enough dead bodies to fill a graveyard, there's plenty of shoot-outs, fights, gratuitous violence, one liners (I love the one by Boothe who when trying to select a hostage to kill says 'you all agree the Mayor's wife has been the most annoying' after she started crying), plenty of explosions & a few plot twists as well. It's all here, it really is. It moves along at a good pace, your never more than a few minutes away from the next action set-piece, the character's are good, the dialogue fine & the plot sound. There's nothing ground breaking in Sudden Death, it is what it is, an action packed 100 odd minutes & to me a near prefect action packed 100 odd minutes.Director Hyams turns in a really good film with plenty of style, some of the aerial shots of the Civic Arena are great & have real scope & a sense of scale when the film is viewed in it's proper 2351 widescreen ratio & his camera is always moving looking for nice angles. The action is often spectacular, from fights on top of the Arena to explosions to rocket launchers to shoot-outs to fights to death defying leaps to helicopter crashes. McCord also turns into McGuyver on a few occasions as he fixes up some home made weapons including bombs & a DIY gun that shoots nails. I loved the commentators as well as we keep cutting back to them & their over enthusiastic comments like 'I don't care if your packing heat you couldn't get in here tonight'! Living in the UK I know next to nothing about Ice Hockey so I really don't know if Sudden Death is an accurate representation of the rules & the sport in general terms although I don't see why it wouldn't be. The film is very violent in places with head-buts, punches, kicks, all manner of items used as makeshift weapons, a huge body count, people are set on fire, shot & stabbed amongst other things.With a supposed budget of about $35,000,000 Sudden Death had a decent budget but it's not up there with the hundred million plus Hollywood blockbusters is it? The film is very well made with high production values, top notch stunt work & good special effects. Shot mainly on location in Pittsburgh. The acting is fine with JCVD phoning in his performance & only turning up to the set to do the stunt work, Boothe makes for a great villain while even the two kids aren't that annoying.Sudden Death is one of my favourite 90's action films, it's action packed with a wide variety of over the top action scenes, it has a great villain & a suitably silly plot that you can't take too seriously.

Under Siege told the story of a bunch of mercenaries who took over a boat only to find out one of their hostages was a cook who used to be a navy seal. In Sudden Death we have a group of (?) guys who hold an ice hockey rink hostage (the crowd and players are oblivious) only to find out that one of the uncontained people there is a maintenance man (good idea) who used to be a fireman (what?). A fireman who knows martial arts and is a decent hockey goalie (OK, has possibilities).So the story here is that a bunch of mercs, led by an awesome Powers Boothe psychopath, take the vice president, who is sitting in the VIP box watching Game 7 of the Stanley Cup (Pittsburgh hosting Chicago if anyone's interested), hostage and threaten to kill one hostage at the end of every period if they don't get the money they're demanding.Van Damme's daughter sees the mascot being shot by one of the mercs and so she is taken hostage, and Van Damme goes on the warpath, kicking ass, fighting on top of the retractable dome on the top of the building, impersonating goalies, knocking out referees and praying the game goes to Sudden Death to give him more time. If nothing else, the crowd saw a heck of a Hockey game!This really isn't a bad movie, and Van Damme is OK in it. Powers Boothe is a brilliant villain, in the class of Alan Rickman or Tommy Lee Jones in the films this one is aspiring to be. There is so much in here that works, But, for some reason, it's just less fun than it should be. Van Damme did a really good job of playing a miscast hero in JCVD later in his career, but here while he's certainly not bad, he's just not as charismatic as Bruce Willis, and he lacks the inexplicable quality Steven Segal has to just get away with doing next to nothing.The script seems to use all its good lines on Boothe (meaning he probably adlibbed a lot) and doesn't have anything much left for anyone else. The kid actors are quite annoying. A lot of the action sequences are contrived, but they still work. The soundtrack is pretty bad, just over emphasizes the big moments which don't really need it. And I thought the ending was a bit weak. In spite of what I've said here, I quite like this. It's not as good as Die Hard or Under Siege, but it is a solid action movie. Probably Van Damme's best outing as a pure action hero. Check it out.

However the plot is so ludicrous it was almost doomed to fail even as a brainless action movie. According to writer Randy Feldman, he wrote the first draft of the screenplay for the movie as a comedy / action movie parody. The movie was later rewritten as a serious action movie. That fact itself should be a warning for the viewer&#x85; The only scene that remained in the finished film was the scene with the penguin mascot (one of the most laughable scenes I have ever seen). A disgraced former fireman takes on a group of terrorists holding the Vice President and others hostage during the seventh game of the NHL Stanley Cup finals. The screenplay is so stupid that kills any possible tension. &#x95; Why the filmmakers decided to make the hostage the Vice President of USA ? Why not have the terrorist attack the President of USA ? &#x95; Why the terrorists would choose a Stanley Cup final to carry out their operation ? &#x95; Furthermore , If you were planning an elaborate almost military criminal operation, why choose a Game 7 ? Why not Game 5 or 6 ? &#x95; Vice President is in attendance and the security is tight. Yet JCVD seems to go where he wants with no visible ID. He even wanders around the arena defusing bombs, no-one stops him aside from the occasional bad guy who tries to kill him. &#x95; It also seems that the bad guys had no problems planting bombs all over the arena and nobody from the security noticed them. &#x95; Access to the elevator is controlled by the Head Chef... Furthermore the security guys are too dumb to check the newcomers for hidden guns or bombs. Secret service agents have rarely been so incompetent. &#x95; The story at the beginning with the little girl dying in JCVD arms had NOTHING to do with the rest of the movie. It would make sense if JCVD for example was afraid of fire or failure and had to fight his fear at some point of movie (think Cliffhanger and the opening scene). &#x95; I can somewhat buy the fact that an ex-fireman knows something about explosives , but it doesn't explain how does he knows martial arts so good. If he was a cop that would make sense , but an ex-fireman ? &#x95; Why the audience inside the hockey stadium is oblivious to the situation despite many explosions around them ? &#x95; Why the bad guy in mascot costume didn't simply kill JCVD daughter ? Why he brought it out to Foss ? He could kill her and hide the body somewhere , it's a big stadion overall. &#x95; The girls in women's bathroom didn't noticed the death body ? &#x95; Why despite many explosions outside the stadium there are NO journalists , media , TV reporters etc etc ? Nobody saw them or nobody thinks there interesting ? &#x95; Who exactly Foss is ? It's never really explained. &#x95; Why didn't the black FBI agent (the traitor) simply killed JCVD instead of playing games with him ? &#x95; The twist with Foss waiting for the end of extra time (Sudden death) to kill all the people in the stadium is just laughable. &#x95; I have never seen people move in such an orderly and polite fashion where they are allegedly in fear for their lives.Some unbelievable moments  Nobody in a hockey mascot costume can see too much or move too fast, so they definitely can't fight. The fact that JCVD almost loses the fight is pure comedy gold . Also, a helicopter's lift is always in a direction nearly parallel to the rotor axis, so it cannot come close to maintaining a position where its nose is straight up. In such a position it would move violently sideways (the rotor leading) and fall rapidly. Oh , JCVD ends up on the ice as the goalie at one point, making a key save !The little kids are terribly annoying. The acting is substandard . Powers Booth overacts his terribly underwritten role. The characters are poorly written and paper-thin.Nobody is really interesting or likable. The action isn't completely unimaginative , yet the stupidity of plot simply destroys any excitement. Not too much of karate here , some might find it disappointing. With stupid plot , lack of martial art sequences and interesting villains this movie doesn't have much to offer. I have to admit that SD has decent budget , special effects and is nicely directed. Some of the jokes and dialogues are actually very funny. It doesn't change the fact that I recommend it only to die-hard fans of JCVD and hockey. I give it 3/10.

A challenge is soon accepted by Foss with McCord agreeing to disarm the bombs before the game ends, which certainly proves difficult since the ones who planted them know their exact locations. McCord, at a disadvantage, must even enter the game playing as a goalie..things in the movie tend to get a wee bit outrageous and far-fetched, but this is a Van Damme movie, and we who watch them know that logic is often not of top priority. Quite violent at times as McCord has to result to vicious means in order to best his opponents..in order to survive, he must sink to their level. Some amazing stunt set-pieces, such as the frightening climax as McCord must climb to the top of the building in order to disarm a bomb, actually opening the ceiling while fighting off baddies..this is certain to make those who are afraid of heights gasp. The movie alternates between the activities of Van Damme and Boothe, the hockey game, and McCord's son, Tyler(Ross Malinger)remaining in his seat at his father's request. It takes a while to get started, but once it does, the film doesn't catch a breath. Van Damme looks physically exhausted by film's end. Often implausible, you'll definitely roll your eyes at how manipulative the film can be, the way the screenplay finds ways for Emily to survive and how the game looks as if it'll end on a downbeat note. The product placement for the Pittsburgh Penguins might make hockey fans of other teams repulsed. Very predictable and follows the action formula, except that Boothe's bunch have no soul and kill without thought. That kind of ruthlessness is rare in a mainstream actioner such as this one.

Basically Darren McCord (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is a disgraced firefighter, he stopped when a girl he tried to rescue died in his arms. Anyway he has moved on, has two kids, daughter Emily (Whittni Wright) and son Tyler (Ross Malinger), and has taken them to see a Pittsburgh Penguins National Hockey League play-off ice hockey game, unaware that upstairs the Vice President (Raymond J. Barry) and a few others are being held hostage by money hungry Joshua Foss (Powers Boothe) and his thugs. Soon enough Darren realises the situation when the bad guys start showing up and trying to kill him, and he knows he must save the V.P., as well as his daughter. Also starring Dorian Harewood as Hallmark. Van Damme is certainly better in this than the very slightly silly Universal Soldier, and it is certainly a film not just for his fans, but for all action film fans. Very good! "},{"Title":"Evidently bigger is not necessarily better!","Date":"26 April 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" In one of Van Damme's highest paid roles up to that point, he stars as Darren McCord, a semi-disgraced fireman who is allowed to return to the job in the capacity of managing the security of an extremely important event &#150; a major hockey game attended not only by his own children, who spend the entire game in the crowded stands unsupervised, but the American vice president himself. Clearly, a lot is riding on Darren doing his job well, so it's not looking in his favor that the entire stadium has already been rigged with enough explosives to kill everyone inside and reduce the landmark stadium to a crater. As always, Van Damme is forced to play a role that is far too American for him. The only thing that is almost consistently disappointing to me about his roles is that he always subdues his Belgian background and plays someone named Kyle or Darren or Frank or Jack or something, and he is always given corny English idioms to say, like Dad! My main man! Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje did the same thing in Legionnaire, with similarly horrendous results. I'm an ESL teacher myself in China, and here's what I can tell you. English learners cannot say idioms like that, American or otherwise. I don't know why, it just never comes out right. I tried to teach one of the Chinese English teachers at my university (who speaks English amazingly well) to say THAT'S what I'm talking' about! The results were comical on so many levels.Nevertheless, I woudn't blame the overall disappointment of Sudden Death on Van Damme's performance. Indeed, the more supposedly bad action movies that I see of his, the more impressed I am with him as an actor in general. The problem is that, first of all, this is by- the-numbers action suspense movie if I've ever seen one, with the single father with the heart of gold picking up his two children from his ex-wife at the beginning of the movie, with the hopes of taking them to an exciting hockey game, which they will watch by themselves while dad is off handling security. This is a b-movie set-up at its most obvious.Even worse, the villain in the movie is a perfect example of a cheesy, cartoonish b-movie bad guy, endangering the lives of tens of thousands of men, women and children, all the while cracking stupid jokes and lounging around as though enjoying a relaxing Sunday afternoon at home (which, incidentally, I happen to be doing right now). I also like the character of the vice president, who becomes almost uncontrollably angry when the bad guys behave badly toward Darren's daughter. He is a man who genuinely cares about people. I hope one day we have a vice president like that again&#133;There is also the interesting fact that, even though the Vice President of the United States is attending the game, the ultimate security of who can get in or out of the stadium, other than the ticket counter (where most of the bad guys get in), comes down to the say-so of the head CHEF. How's that again? I don't know how often the VP's personal security hinges on a chef in real life, but my guess is not very often. Of course, this is a landmark game, so the place is packed to the brim (I don't care if you were packing heat, you couldn't get in here!), which is a perfect set up for a massive hostage situation. Of course, everything in the movie is overdone by about 20 times. Not only are there 50,000 people or so involved, but the demanded ransom is no less than $1.7 BILLION. There are also numerous acts of terrorism that they do to show that they're messing around, which are generally botched or make no sense. At one point, a helicopter is shot down while a man is rapelling down from it. He falls to his death, but the helicopter was apparently incinerated upon explosion, as it doesn't seem to fall or land or anything. All we see is a fire in the parking lot. Another time, Van Damme hacks into the stadium's computer system and uses the outside marquee to tell the cops in the parking lot what the situation is, leading to a sniper blowing the thing up with a bazooka. The police are disappointed to lose their contact, but no one else seems to notice.There are lots of stupid one-liners in the movie (These guys want to see a hockey game so bad, maybe we should put them on ice!), but I have to say that for his part, Van Damme did the best he could with the material he was given. The ending of the movie is not even the slightest bit realistic, but impressive nevertheless. More than anything else, I was impressed with the actual landing and explosion than anything else. Maybe this is what they spent their whole pyrotechnic budget on and that's why they couldn't afford to show the other helicopter crashing. The ending is wrapped up in a nice little package, which is unfortunate, but I've yet to see the moderate budget action movie that defies that little convention. This is a much bigger movie than most of Van Damme's previous films, but it's not better. Fans will surely have a good time, but it's not an action movie for all tastes. I've seen a lot worse though&#133; "},{"Title":"Van Damme as a fireman hero fighting against mean terrorists into an  ice-hockey stadium","Date":"19 November 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Darren(Jean Claude Van Damme) is a firemen, he carries his sons to a Pittsburgh Penguin national Hockey play-off where is taking place the final.But the arena has been taken by a terrorists led by a cruel villain(Powers Boothe).

Van Damme does get hurt, cut and bruised - which is wholly refreshing for this kind of action star, and the bad guy is most certainly the best character in the whole film and delivers the key one line phrases that only bad guys can deliver.The action is very similar to Die Hard, running around - jumping out of the way of explosions, it even has it's obligitary jump from the top of the building scene.Regardless of what you think of Van Damme, or what you think of die hard clones, you have to admit that Sudden Death is certainly one of the best clones there is, I certainly enjoyed it - its a shame that silly bad action movie cliches took over by the end.Rating 7/10 "},{"Title":"Who doesn't like action, hockey, and mayhem?","Date":"12 June 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  I loved this movie for a lot of reasons1.)

But in this movie, JCVD (playing Darren McCord) is reduced to fighting a hockey team's mascot (which looks like a cross between a hen and a penguin) -- and worst of all he comes very close to losing. And that fight scene really sums up this entire movie. Jean Claude Van Damme was in his element when he was playing unapologetically macho guys in movies that were so cheesy, so laid back, and so consciously silly that they were funny and fun to watch. In addition, some of Van Damme's martial arts fight scenes in those laid back, silly films were brilliant in terms of their execution. But in director Peter Hyams' Sudden Death, all of that cheesy, laid back, silliness that made the JCVD movies so entertaining was lost in a barrage of loud and remarkably boring shoot em ups, explosions, and stunts. Plus the martial arts fights in this movie are few and far between and nothing compared to the wonderful martial arts sequences in JCVD films like Bloodsport, Kickboxer, and even (shockingly enough) Black Eagle.As for the plot, I will not go into all the details about why this movie is awful because there is simply not enough room in this review for that. Suffice it to say, there are two main problems. To begin with, the lead villain (who is so boring that I honestly forgot his name) explains right in the beginning that he will shoot people if $500 million of U.S. government money is not delivered into his bank account by the end of a (get this) period in a hockey game. Hockey, for those who do not follow the sport, has three periods, which leads one to conclude that the villain wants $1.5 billion in all. This scene, where the lead villain explains his plan, sucks out most of this film's excitement and suspense because predictably enough when the first and second periods of the hockey game end, people die violent deaths in scenes that are identical to each other. If that is not bad enough, this film tacks on a ridiculous plot twist at the end of the third period. Apparently the hockey teams are drawn 4-4 and go into sudden death, which inexplicably influences the lead villain to postpone his original plan to kill everyone in the hockey stadium (which he says he will do if all the money is not delivered by the end of the third period) to the end of sudden death, giving Van Damme just enough time to save the dumb hockey fans. Maybe I could have excused this flawed plot, if the villains were given interesting things to say and do. But the villains in Sudden Death are very dull fellows and not frightening at all. As a result, we are not concerned about their potential victims and we are not entertained by the villains. So my advice is to have fun reading this review, have a few laughs, and be glad that you missed this film.

Nothing about the film is fresh or innovative; but nothing about it is so bad that you feel the urge to switch off. Just a solid, workmanlike action movie that goes about its business in an efficient manner. It's the kind of movie that Bruce Willis does in his sleep, with the Muscles From Brussels giving as close to a real performance as he has ever done in his career. With veteran director Peter Hyams at the helm, one would expect nothing less.Firefighter Darren McCord (Jean Claude Van Damme) quits the service after failing to save a young girl in a house fire. Traumatised and depressed, he later takes a job as a safety marshal at the Pittsburgh ice hockey arena. One night a high profile Stanley Cup game is taking place between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Chicago Blackhawks, and McCord manages to secure some free tickets for his kids. That same night the American Vice President (Raymond J. Barry) is also attending the game, and it isn't long before the politician's executive box is seized by a gang of terrorists led by ex-CIA agent Joshua Foss (Powers Boothe). Foss and his gang want a fortune in ransom money in exchange for the Vice President's life, and instruct that each instalment of the money must be paid before the end of each period of the game. Failure to pay will result in the killing of a member of the VP's guest party. But worse still, McCord discovers that the entire arena is rigged with explosives which the terrorists intend to detonate at the end of the night in order to make their escape&#133;. resulting in the deaths of thousands of unsuspecting hockey fans! It becomes a race against time and a one-man struggle for McCord, as he races to save the day. The stakes are high enough, but they get even higher when his daughter becomes an additional hostage of the terrorist gang.The film does not pretend to aspire to realism and aims very deliberately for the level of entertaining junk. On such a level, it is not an unenjoyable affair. Hyams, working from a script by Gene Quintano, ensures the pace rarely slackens and choreographs some rough and ready fight sequences. Van Damme is plunged from one death-defying situation to another as he races around the arena trying to thwart the villains &#150; (for a guy painfully aware of his own vulnerability - he did, after all, take personal responsibility for the death of a little girl in a house fire - he makes a terrific job of wiping out his adversaries). In perhaps the film's most memorably wacky moment, Van Damme comes face to face with a female assassin dressed as a penguin and gets involved in a ruthless fight to the death against her. In another outlandish fight sequence set in a kitchen, Van Damme rams a chicken bone into the bad guy's neck! The main acting honours go to Powers Boothe, coldly convincing as a VERY nasty chief villain, but Van Damme actually tries to act a little less woodenly than usual (as one reviewer has already correctly pointed out, he's better at it than Steven Seagal!) On the whole, Sudden Death is mindlessly entertaining junk &#150; and, since that's all it was ever intended to be, one can't grumble too much about that!

Out of this group two have better action (Hard Target and Knock Off), and one has a plot with actual human emotions and some clever plot devices in it ('Time Cop', featuring a plot by noted sf writer Mark Verheiden). Why does Sudden Death belongs in this group? Because it lets Van Damme do all the acting schticks he knows how to do, without asking him to do anything he can't do. It has a decent script (if you're going to rip off a movie, you could a lot worse than Die Hard). The character he plays is well conceived - tough and resourceful, but not a superhero or a gun slinger by any means. It provides a good B-level supporting cast that doesn't stink up the movie. (The two kids who play McCord's children are decent for child actors, Powers Boothe is his usual expansive, amorphously sinister-yet-humorous self). And a sense of humor is on display during the proceedings - some of the jokes and one-liners actually work, and Van Damme can do dry, underplayed wit sometimes when he manages to wrap his accent around the dialog. On the other hand, it IS a Van Damme film, so it is limited by the limits of Van Damme as an actor and an action star. (Face it, Jackie Chan and Jet Li make The Muscle From Brussels look like a one trick pony, and Arnold is a better actor.) Boothe has to make a lot of speeches about dirty tricks, CIA paranoia, etc, and it's just too generic and faux-cynical - it's like the screenwriters took notes during Alan Rickman's similar speeches in Die Hard, but couldn't get the knack of what they were trying to imitate. And the ending climax is about 10 minutes too long (always a problem with this type of movie) so it taxes your patience.

Barry) is held hostage by armed terrorists during a nationally televised hockey match in Pittsburgh's Civic Arena.The second of two collaborations between action star Van Damme and director-cinematographer Peter Hyams (the first was TIMECOP in 1994), SUDDEN DEATH swaps the inventiveness of that earlier film for action and violence, executed with visual flair and a knowing sense of humor (cf. the brutal scrap between Van Damme and a villain dressed as a penguin!). Powers Boothe enjoys himself immensely as the rogue CIA agent holding court over a team of foot-soldiers who struggle valiantly to prevent Our Hero from ruining Boothe's plan to steal a billion dollars from US bank accounts during the course of a single hockey game.Van Damme is as personable as ever, whether battling murderous assassins, squaring off against Boothe on top of the Civic Arena's huge dome, or saving his sickly-sweet kids (Whittni Wright and Ross Malinger) from destruction as a series of bombs are detonated within the building. It's loud, it's silly, and it ends with a helicopter falling through an opening in the roof of the arena, an outrageous sequence which sets the cap on a thoroughly diverting barnstormer. Written by industry vet Gene Quintano, also responsible for the likes of COMIN' AT YA! (1981), TREASURE OF THE FOUR CROWNS (1982) and several entries in the Police Academy franchise.Van Damme made his directorial debut the following year with THE QUEST (1996), a not-bad retread of his earlier movie BLOODSPORT (1987), followed by several unhappy - though entertaining - collaborations with the cream of Hong Kong action directors (MAXIMUM RISK, DOUBLE TEAM, KNOCK OFF, etc.), before he descended into DTV hell with the likes of LEGIONNAIRE (1998) and UNIVERSAL SOLDIER THE RETURN (1999). Hyams - whose early films included the likes of CAPRICORN ONE (1978), THE STAR CHAMBER (1983) and 2010 (1984) - has since transformed into the J. Lee Thompson of modern cinema, with super-efficient potboilers like THE RELIC (1997), END OF DAYS (1999) and THE MUSKETEER (2001).

It's not enough to have Van Damme actually fight a giant penguin, but to use hot pepper, meat tenderizers, and various kitchen utensils to get the job done. I laughed during this sequence. I even smiled.Sudden Death has other moments of inspired comic brilliance, sandwiched between, yes, typical action movie set pieces. Another such instance is the moment Van Damme suits up in hockey gear and buys time by playing on the ice. Once again, I smiled.Sudden Death is, for better, or for worse, a typical action, typical Van Damme thriller, cloned after Die Hard right down to the nasty villain, the one man against the plot, and several hostages at risk. The material is tired and predictable, true, but Peter Hyams directs the film with confidence and a wink, and gives Van Damme alot of tasks to fulfill whilst terrorists do their dirty work one step behind him. On that note, the film is pretty good.Van Damme... Let's face it, the guy has been in the business almost twenty years, and he's still one who has trouble with the english language. Here, he's not half bad, having not a whole lot to say and flexing his muscles and performing clever, nail-biting action sequences instead of dialogue. It may be his best performance, but that's really not saying much. Actually, it's Powers Boothe who dominates the movie as Joshua Foss, the head baddie, who has some terrific dialogue, snazzy one-liners, and a sneering, reprehensible attitude.His plan is to hold the Vice President hostage during a hockey game, and demand zillions of dollars, or he'll blow the whole building to smithereens. Been there, done that, but like I said, it's several sly, unexpected comedic moments, exciting action sequences, Van Damme's competent hero, and Boothe's seething villain that make up for story lulls.Terror goes into overtime...

What with that, and the sheer amount of contrivances, one could hardly call what's left a storyline. To say the screenplay has borrowed from the Die Hard premise would be to make the world's most blatant understatement!Here we have a troubled hero working in the huge Pittsburgh Indoor Ice Rink as a fire Marshall. On the night of the seventh game of the finals series he gets tickets so he can treat his estranged children to the deciding game, and of course spend a little time with them. Also catching the match, but for political reasons, is the Vice President of the United States (Raymond J. Barry). When a bunch of incredibly well organised mercenaries capture the V.P.'s box and demand hundreds of millions in government money, our hero Darren McCord has his plans more than slightly put out.Each time a new one of these formula flicks is made it seems that all we get in the way of innovation is nastier bad guys, and more and more spectacular and gruesome ways in which the good guys dispose of them. Director Hyams and his screenwriter have gone over the top (not that this is an original sin) in trying to make us loathe the wicked terrorists. The horrible baddies go about shooting the secret service, the security and the civilians (both old and young) with gay abandon, and with scant regard for the relative threat of each victim.Van Damme engages in plenty of fisty-cuffs and gunplay, heroics and death defying stunts. The script asks little of the musclebound European. Almost everyone else has walk-ons apart from Powers Boothe, who seriously overdoes his under written, shallow role as the cruelest, meanest old ring leader there ever was.There's a lot of clever cinematography, and enough explosive special f/x to keep anyone awake. But really, that's all this action flick has, action. Though there are some nifty sequences, nothing could be called outrageously brilliant.Saturday, February 10, 1996 - Greater Union Melbourne "},{"Title":"Excellent Action Packed Thriller, Die Hard Style!, With An Amazing Performance From Van Damme!","Date":"31 July 2005","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" Excellent action packed thriller, Die Hard style, with an amazing performance from Van Damme as usual!.

But the outcome wasn't THAT cool. As the Star Wars' quote, every good factor got such a strange point of weakness that nearly destroyed it.Van Damme was at his worst. Firstly he's not a very good actor but here he's so bad one. His face had nothing but one-note clueless expression. Sometimes he looked confused or just tired, and in the rest he wasn't even there ! Speaking of which, the man who we used to watch his movies for his clever martial arts and famous kicks, in this one he did neither. For 90 % of the well-choreographed fights his stuntman did the job, and the real man was there for only the easy close-ups in between (with the same one-note clueless expression !). I thought that that diligent stuntman deserved a separate movie or at least putting his name on the credits before Van Damme ! I knew later, by one of the True Hollywood Story documentaries, that during (Sudden Death) and (Double Team) Jean-Claude was having a serious coke problem, making these 2 movies, as someone referred; sleepwalking !The script !!!! I love Die Hard movies. Rarely to watch a cleverly written one. This time the design of the situation was flawless; terrorists holding the Vice President and others hostage with bomb threatening in a full stadium during a Hockey match and for its limited time, the lead as crazy former fireman who has a problem with his kids not seeing him as someone matters, a twist in which the helpful policeman turns into an enemy, many fistfights in different place every time (a gym, kitchen, etc.), and saving the whole on the nick of time. BUT sorry, that so promising material was handled quickly to be far from the classic it could've been. And that flawless structure was replete with flaws that would provoke you to ask even if you intended not to!To instance  Why the evil woman didn't kill the lead's daughter ? (she wasn't out of bullets, as she claimed latter, because she had one bullet that killed the security man later), rather how whoever that security man talked to in the wireless didn't investigate about that interrupted message he got or that GUNSHOT he heard ?! The scene where the lead's boy didn't get with the disloyal officer was such a joke ? He could've drugged him, or had him easily; saying to the people how disturbing my young relative is. Originally what's the need of this boy since they already have the lead's daughter ? Maybe for seeing, and being proud of, the father playing Hockey successfully later? But that's something the daughter could've done. Even as a thrill at the end to save the boy while the explosions, it was so anti-climax since the whole stadium was unaffected !!Moreover, what was the threat since the bombs didn't damage anything or anyone? In fact that evil man must be the stupidest terrorist in the world, killing all the people, saying vague phrases like I'm immortal, while not winning a dime. Or how he was about exploding the whole place while being in it? How nobody ever paid attention when the stadium's roof was opened ? How nobody, NOBODY, in it heard anything of the endless multifarious explorations outside ? How the helicopter dropped vertically into the stadium while its moving fan didn't kill, harm, or wing the lead or his daughter ? And finally How that very daughter noticed the tiny red tattoo on the evil guy's hand while at least hundreds of people were running around in terror ???!!!The directing kept a steamy atmosphere going on. The image was as promising as the rest of the factors however achieved. The red and blue personality for the cinematography worked, being real cinematic and the only dazzling thing in here. No wonder since director (Peter Hyams) is basically a director of cinematography. The action sequences were acute, it's just the editor's crime when I saw the face of Van Damme's stuntman so damn clear more than once and during close-ups as well ! Nevertheless, if the scriptwriter didn't make the things solid, how the director didn't see any of that? Plus some little flaws ; how drops of scalding stuff burned the officer wholly in a second ?!, or how the surprise of that officer as evil wasn't well portrayed.As for the acting, I don't know who's to blame; the casting? The directing? Or the actors? In any case, the actors will be surely blamed. (Powers Boothe) isn't Lee-Jones or Rickman. He was delivering the good lines badly, lacking both the charisma and the talent. And when it comes to putting an equal evil man to the good guy, (Boothe) isn't a peer to Van Damme even in his ugliest hour ! The boy also did some of the worst acting I've seen. Anyway, it's where the child who played the daughter gave the top acting this movie had !Some details were so smart and catchy; sending messages to the police by the ads' boards, disguising as a player, talking secretly by the mutes' language, using everyday items to fight the foes, the magical tricks of that fire marshal. But oh my god, these fine details weren't in the fine movie it deserved. From my list in the same year there were another clones  (Shu dan long wei), (Under Siege 2 Dark Territory), and part 3 of the one which started it all (Die Hard With a Vengeance). (Sudden Death)'s only consolation is that it's better than (Under Siege 2) !It could've been genius action. But it ended up as ambitious, highly glossy, another B movie.

Why? Because it tries so damn hard to be something bigger - yet fails in spectacular fashion.JCVD was a fireman but after a rescue goes wrong and a little girl is killed he loses the plot, and his nerve. Two years later he has gotten his sh*t together enough to be the fire marshall of a sporting arena, where coincidentally Game 7 of the NHL finals is taking place.First aside - If you were planning an elaborate almost military criminal operation, why choose a Game 7? Surely the risk is too high that Game 5 or 6 will see a winner emerge, rendering game 7 unnecessary and your plan ruined! So the Vice President is in attendance and JCVD is taking his two young kids along (from a former marriage). Security is (allegedly) tight, although JCVD seems to go where he wants with no visible ID, including wandering into the locker room with the players pre-game.Aside 2 - You did see it was Game 7 didn't you? Of the NHL finals! Something many players don't ever experience over long careers!... And some guy wanders in with his two kids chatting to the players? OK, so there is an elevator to the Luxury box where the Vice Prez is viewing the game with his associated hangers on and other big wigs, access to the elevator is controlled by the Head Chef... (You heard me!) Bad guys take over the luxury box, threatening to kill everyone if billions in frozen drug money isn't passed into multiple bank accounts in their control.From here I'll let you decide if JCVD is a negligent fire marshall or a negligent Dad - as he performs precious few duties associated with either.Like many other equally dodgy films this rips Die Hard at every turn, only it is so shameless that I wonder why they didn't just give characters names like Hans, Al and Argyle.Some points of interest JCVD has a life or death fight with a woman wearing a penguin outfit! If that isn't bad enough he very nearly loses - fighting someone in a bulky penguin costume! JCVD wanders around the arena defusing bombs, no-one stops him aside from the occasional bad guy who tries to kill him. That would be bad enough except when you think that at one point the criminals were able to wander around themselves planting the explosives. I know this is pre September 11 but surely prior to a massive even like the Game 7 of any sporting contest some minor security checks take place? In one of the most ridiculous sequences ever shown in a mainstream film, JCVD ends up on the ice as the goalie at one point, making a key save! I feel nauseous right now.When it all hits the fan and the entire crowd must rush for the exits everyone moves along in an orderly fashion and the arena is emptied in minutes, allowing the final series of ridiculous showdowns to take place.Final aside - I've been to many sporting events, admittedly none where a major terrorist incident took place, and I have never seen people move in such an orderly and polite fashion where they are allegedly in fear for their lives.Verdict - Rips off Die Hard at every turn, only with a plot so ludicrous it was almost doomed to fail even as a brainless action movie.This movie tried harder to be different than any other JCVD film I have ever seen, which is probably why I am so hard on it for failing.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com "},{"Title":"Suddenly Awful","Date":"21 November 2005","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" They say JC has a habit of calling up all the reviewers of his masterpieces, apologising for making yet another abysmal turkey, and promising that the next movie will finally be great.I'm sure glad he doesn't have my phone number.This one is so brain dead and so over the top with gore and violence it's not funny.

Let's do a cheap knock-off, and see if we can make as much money! Then they cast Jean-Claude Van Damme in the lead role, thereby putting the final nail in the coffin. To call Damme an actor would be an insult to anyone who was dealt with acting or at the very least seen actual acting. He's a karate fighter who gets cast in movies where he gets to do karate moves. That's it. He has no screen presence, and no charisma. That's why he'll never be a good action hero; we don't care about him. Arnold is the personification of kick-ass. Bruce Lee was a spiritual, calm and collected person who could beat you up before you were even aware of his presence, if he wanted to. Most lesser known/popular/typical action heroes(Stallone, Willis) have some charm or appeal. Damme, like Seagal and Norris, doesn't. Anyone who likes him likes him because of his fighting skills. Which is fine, I'm not ragging fans of martial arts fighting who like his films just for that; but it's just not enough. He shouldn't try to make big action films... he should settle for some martial arts films. This cheap copy of Die Hard is just not worth watching for anyone but his core fans. The plot is ridiculous and riddled with holes. The acting is substandard. The characters are poorly written and paper-thin. The action is dull, though not completely unimaginative. The film is predictable and uninteresting, from start to finish. You're never particularly excited. What might even disappoint the biggest of Van Damme fans, is that the fighting isn't even that much hand-to-hand; half of it is just the fighters slamming each other into stuff. Very little of the karate that is the reason for his fame and popularity. Most people really should just skip this one, I think. I recommend it exclusively to huge fans of Van Damme, as I suspect they're the only ones that could enjoy it. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Stupid premise, funny movie","Date":"20 March 2003","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  Jean-Claude Van Damme is the epitome  of B-movie superstardom. Take for example  this film. Here's a great question. If someone  threatened to blow up a hockey arena, would  anyone care? Sure, think of the people, but  then again, ITS HOCKEY! While Van Damme  stumbled through his scenes with his usual  comic ferocity, this film at least had the gall  to know it was stupid AND inconceivable.  That's a combo you can't get in most films.  Nonetheless, this film will remain on my long  list of stupid films that I would watch any rainy  day.

He was fresh, funny, and new.  Then action films in general have became over done, and he became boring, tired, and old.  This film has all the typical plot twists that ever one has seen before.  I wish him luck if he does anymore like this one.

I wish I could just have a review that stated this simple principle, but I must bore you with more bad review type words like 'horrible' 'clichéd' and 'unwatchable.' It's the type of film you watch when you are drunk or are stuck on a desert island with nothing else to do. Here's the premise the vice president is captured by a terrorist group at a play-off hockey game and only Van Damm can stop the madness. Truly, truly terrible, but then again, I didn't pay to see it the first time around and only my dad felt the absence of girth in his wallet after this movie. I hate the fact he is a Republican and all, but then again, he did spare me the horror of paying for this piece of garbage. Okay, that is now enough space to be recognized as a review, so I bid adieu. "},{"Title":"Unbelievable! (In a bad way, unfortunately)","Date":"30 June 2001","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  I know you have to check your brain at the door for these action films, (Not necessary for some of the goons that enjoy them!) but this is so way out there that no one could believe it.  There are uncountable goofs throughout the film, the plot is childish and totally fake. The acting is non-existent, and the ending is the worst of all.  This film is a total waste of money and time.  "},{"Title":"Who are we kidding?","Date":"13 March 2009","Score":"2 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" This is a pale imitation of the Die Hard franchise that just sucks. The low ambitions of the movie are clearly on display when the terrorists hold the Vice-President hostage and he has to call the White House to beg them to transfer some money. In most movies of this genre the President is kidnapped or held hostage because after all he (or she) is the most powerful person in the country with finger on the nuclear button etc etc. Would most Americans have really been worried if Dick Cheney had been kidnapped? The honest answer is- probably not. Why the terrorists would choose a Stanley Cup final to carry out their operation and why, despite many explosions around them, the audience inside the hockey stadium is oblivious to the situation, are unanswerable questions. Let's just say this film is really hokey, not hockey. Those who liked the film and found it to be exciting should get a life.

It is the worst Van Damme film and one of the worst of any sort I have ever seen. It would appeal to somebody with no depth whatever who requires nothing more than gunfire and explosions to be entertained.Seeing that this is directed by Peter Hyams it has made me realise that Peter has no talent as a director, but is very good at filming explosions and the like. However, movies need other elements as well; for example, a story. This one didn't have one. This might explain the awfulness of some of Mr. Hyams' more recent films, hardly any better than this one, really.One can't help wondering how some people ever were put behind a camera.

The plot is just plain idiotic and the acting is terrible.  This movie isn't even worth watching on regular TV, let alone renting it.  Simply put this is a horrible, horrible movie.  Avoid this movie at all costs.  You have been warned! "}]
