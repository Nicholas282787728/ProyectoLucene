[{"Title":"A gem","Date":"31 May 2005","Score":"89 out of 102 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" Driving Miss Daisy is an unusual film. Although it's really more of an extended pair of entwined character portraits--spanning a quarter of a century--it has all of the narrative focus and tightness of a more traditionally structured mystery plot.The character portraits are of Daisy Werthan (Jessica Tandy) and Hoke Colburn (Morgan Freeman). The film is set in suburbs of Atlanta and begins in the late 1940s or early 1950s. Daisy is wealthy, but she wasn't born that way. Her son, Boolie (Dan Aykroyd) runs the successful family business--a large textile factory. At the beginning of the film, we see Miss Daisy, who is already around 60 years old or so, have a driving mishap--she has the car in the wrong gear and runs off of her driveway, almost completely backing over a 10 foot drop to the neighbor's driveway, at about 20 miles an hour. This naturally concerns Boolie, and when Daisy has a problem finding a company that is willing to insure her after the accident, Boolie hires Hoke--also rapidly approaching elderly--as her driver, against her protests. She doesn't want a driver. She doesn't want someone else in her house. She doesn't want to be treated as if she's incapable. Driving Miss Daisy is an exploration of Hoke and Daisy's relationship, all the way into the early 1970s.Alfred Uhry adapted the script from a play he wrote by the same name that was first produced Off-Broadway. Although the play began in a small theater, it had good reviews and good word of mouth, necessitating a move to a larger theater. Uhry eventually won a Pulitzer Prize for his work. He has said that that Driving Miss Daisy was semi-biographical about his grandmother and her driver.That fact probably helped create the remarkable depth of character shown in the film, although certainly director Bruce Beresford, Freeman, who also starred in the play, and Tandy do more than their share to build a charming, frequently funny and poignant portrayal of two very different humans learning to see eye to eye.It's significant that Driving Miss Daisy is set in the South and spans the period prior to and slightly after the civil rights movement in the US. And it's significant that Hoke is an African-American while Miss Daisy is Jewish.Miss Daisy is humorously fussy, prim and proper. Well, to the audience at least--I don't suppose it would be so humorous to have to deal with it. This helps create an initial formal antagonism between Daisy and Hoke. Only infinite calm and patience from Hoke earns a gradual softening of Daisy's public displeasure and curmudgeonliness. The unusual structure means that Driving Miss Daisy is more a series of vignettes, each significant to the gradual coming together of Hoke and Daisy, although most incidents are relatively minor in isolation. Uhry makes the film a collection of those small but memorable, important and frequently amusing (at least in retrospect) moments that make up a lifetime of telling memories in any familial relationship--and Hoke does become family. Eventually, Hoke and Daisy form a bond that is perhaps stronger than Daisy's bond with her own son.As for the significance of Hoke and Daisy's ethnic orientations, Miss Daisy makes a vocal point of not being racist or otherwise discriminatory. She also likes to focus on her humble beginnings--a few incidents near the beginning of her relationship with Hoke hinge on her being embarrassed at her wealth. And of course, as a Jew in the South, she is well aware of discrimination and disadvantage, having experienced it first hand.One of the more touching scenes of the film features Hoke and Daisy driving to Alabama to attend her brother's 90th birthday party. It's Hoke's first time outside of Georgia. They've parked temporarily on the side of the road. Two white Alabama policemen see Hoke and pull over. They want to know what Hoke is doing with a nice, new Cadillac. When they discover that Daisy is Jewish, they are disparaging through implicature, and they make a literally discriminatory remark to each other when Hoke and Daisy drive off. Although these kinds of events are much more major than say, apparently stealing a can of salmon, Uhry and Beresford tie them together wonderfully so that they all have about the same significance.Related to these themes, the film is also charming and moving for juxtaposing a kind of personal consistency throughout time with a rapidly changing society. That's why the profound social changes happening just next door, so to speak, are largely kept in the background.Technically, Driving Miss Daisy is a gem. It's full of subtly complex and aesthetically pleasing cinematography, well blocked scenes and a fabulous and deservedly famous score from Hans Zimmer. But the story and performances are so good that it's almost difficult to notice the technical stuff.Unless you are completely averse to anything even slightly in the realm of realist drama/light comedy, Driving Miss Daisy is a must-see. It's sentimental but not syrupy and touching but not overly serious--you'll laugh just as often as anything else. Don't miss this one if you haven't yet seen it.

The first time I saw it I did not like it and thought it was very overrated. Why I gave more looks, I don't really remember but it went to fair the next time and excellent by the third. I think the main reason is that I shifted my focus off the irritable old woman (Jessica Tandy) to the long-suffering servant (Morgan Freeman).Once I looked at this story through Hoke's eyes, it became an inspiring story. Freeman's character, Hoke Colburn, simply provides the best the example of a what true servant of God should act like, plain-and-simple. It's one of the best examples on film I've seen of of patience, kindness, dedication and dignity in a difficult situation. It's also always inspiring to see a nice, good person overturn and win over the opposite with sheer kindness.Another factor that has raised my rating of this film is the latest newly-restored widescreen edition, which finally presents this movie as it should be, with all its beautiful cinematography. The sets in here are great, a terrific look at the 1950s through storefronts, billboards, automobiles, etc.One thing this film taught me Hoke's attitude isn't the only important aspect of this story. It's how we, as viewers, look at things, too, that makes a difference.

What grows between these two is something most people only wish to have in their lives. What is so special about it, though?From the beginning of their relationship, the two are forced to be together. Daisy is forced to have a driver and Hoke is hired on for that position. For both, the relationship is one out of need.  Hoke needs a paying job and Daisy needs a driver in her old age (although, she would never admit it to anyone especially herself).As time goes by, though, Daisy's need of Hoke becomes clearer to herself. She begins to depend on him.  This is definitely made clear at the end when Hoke is feeding Daisy her pumpkin pie, and she enjoys each bite fully.Another aspect of the movie which got to me was the great array of choices the director made with the filming.  Hoke is a character of very few words but teaches Daisy so much.  Morgan Freeman's acting in this character is amazing.  The knowledge he shows within his eyes is one reason I almost felt closer to him than Daisy did throughout the first half of the movie.  In a way, he teaches her a new way of life.  He does so by showing himself truly and honestly.Another choice the director made was in the symbolic way the film was made. The beauty of the many seasons is shown through the changes of the landscape.  The trees transform from winter to spring and the streets go from sheets of ice to warm asphalt.  And the cars get larger and more high tech.  Time is so important in Daisy's and Hoke's affection/friendship that this is a great way to show that.There are so many aspects of this film which I could go on and on about. It is a wonderful film of which any person can get a fulfilling movie watching experience out of.  They can also learn a lot from it, too!  Watch it.

Winner of 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture of 1989, Driving Miss Daisy is about a black man who goes to work as a chauffeur for a stubborn old Jewish woman. Morgan Freeman and the late Jessica Tandy give brilliant performances in the lead roles, and they've never been better. I sure do miss seeing the presence of Tandy in the movies. She was good in just about everything she did in both feature and TV movies (her heart in acting always belonged to the stage). She very deservedly won the Best Actress Oscar for her role as Miss Daisy, a person who at first is not happy about this man coming into her life but learns to accept it and forms a real special friendship. Freeman is every bit her match here as Hoke, the chauffeur. The exchanges between the two in the beginning are very funny and very touching at the end. Dan Aykroyd takes on a rare serious role in Driving Miss Daisy as Tandy's son Boolie, a businessman who hires Hoke to be Miss Daisy's driver. And the late Esther Rolle (of TV's Good Times and Maude) has a nice small part as Miss Daisy's maid. When this movie came out in late 1989 it was guaranteed many Oscar nominations. Then the nominations came out in February 1990 and Driving Miss Daisy got the most with 9 nominations. But one nomination was missing Best Director. And what a gyp that was! Bruce Beresford did a terrific job of directing Driving Miss Daisy and to this day I will never understand why the Academy didn't nominate him. The Academy voters for the Best Director category got stupid that year and Beresford was omitted unfairly. This is a terrific movie and the director should have been nominated. Richard Zanuck, one of the producers of Driving Miss Daisy, said something in March 1990 when accepting the Best Picture Oscar for this movie along with the other producer and real-life wife Lili Fini Zanuck that I completely agree with. He said quote Were up here for one very simple reason and that's the fact that Bruce Beresford is a brilliant director. It's as simple as that! And Driving Miss Daisy is proof. It's a great movie.**** (out of four)  "},{"Title":"Driving Miss Daisy is a masterpiece.","Date":"19 May 2000","Score":"38 out of 51 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":"  Looking for a great, in-yer-face fast-moving action THRILLER? Driving Miss Daisy ain't it.Looking for a great MOVIE? You're in the right place.Driving Miss Daisy charts the subtly-shifting relationship between Miss Daisy, a very reluctantly aging Jewish lady who's no longer able to drive for herself, and her new (and, as you can expect, rather unwelcome!) driver -- a not-terribly-young-himself Black guy (or African-American guy, whichever you prefer) named Hoke.Bear in mind this is the Deep South of the 1950's and 60's we're talking about here, and the racial attitudes and prejudices of that time make for fascinating background -- as does the whole general culture, which I believe was well portrayed.The directors frankly took on some delicate racial subject matter here (and certainly the racial divide in those days was very deep indeed) -- but they handled it with remarkable skill. I think they succeeded so well because they brought you into the lives of people as people, not just as cardboard stereotypes. Long before the movie is over, you find yourself really caring about the two main characters -- Daisy and Hoke.This is a movie about life, relationships, and people. You see some good things -- and also some very human weaknesses, not the least of which is sheer stubborn pride.I personally was a child of the deep South, and I appreciate movies such as this one and Jessica Tandy's other wonderful movie Fried Green Tomatoes (which is in some ways very similar) which give us a glimpse into the culture of those days. There are definitely things we can learn from the past, and there are also things we can learn from watching how people change over the course of their lives.Several moments from this movie stand out, some of which are funny, some sobering, and some of which are particularly movingThe scene involving Dr. Martin Luther King.The unashamedly bigoted comments of a 50's or 60's police officer.A great scene involving Hoke and Miss Daisy's businessman son.An incredible scene in which Jessica Tandy portrays the aging Miss Daisy.And, perhaps most of all, what Miss Daisy says to Hoke towards the end of the movie.Now personally, I love action movies so well that I was initially reluctant even to watch this one. This is not a movie of action, but it IS a movie of substance and beauty, mixed with some funny moments.The acting is great, the script and directing are beautifully done, and the substance, humor and beauty are such that overall, I consider Driving Miss Daisy, one of the best movies I've ever seen.

I have not seen all of Freeman's   films, nor do I wish to. Of those I have seen he is more or less 'O.K.'   as you might say; What makes 'Driving Miss Daisy' work is the human and   humane compassion and sympathy flowing between the two lead actors,   with Dan Ackroyd, surprisingly, and Esther Rolle both lending a good   hand.    One might argue that it is 'only' an oversweetened sentimental story;   be that as it may, the film endeavours to portray the aging   relationship between the white Jewish rich woman and her poor black   chauffeur throughout 25 years. And Jessica Landry was over eighty years   old when she made this film. In this aspect, evidently the film   succeeds, as the story itself is really of secondary importance it is   the beautifully filmed scenes and the dialogues which build up to   something greater than the story per se. In an age dominated by cinema   stuffed with violence, sex, special effects and so on, here is an   example without such measures, relying on pure acting and   interpretative skills so as to tell a clean simple story.    You might well like to compare this film with Lindsay Anderson's 'The   Whales of August' (1987) (qv), with an absolutely unrepeatable cast   with Lillian Gish, Bette Davis, Vincent Price and Ann Sothern a   delicious retrospective piece.    'Driving Miss Daisy' was meticulously made, with all those cars of the   50's and 60's and the careful scene settings, brought out by excellent   photography, and all backed up by what must be Hans Zimmer's most   appropriate and touching score. His score was also good in that   tremendous film 'Thelma and Louise' as well as in 'The House of the   Spirits' and 'Beyond Rangoon' (1995) (qv).    'Driving Miss Daisy' is one of those videos in my collection which I am   pleased to blow the dust off and watch yet again it is still as   charming as ever.

Some will say its too saccherine, or not a realistic look at the civil rights struggle, but they miss the point. Miss Daisy is part of a smaller minority within a majority; while not mistreated the way Hoke would be, she's still an outsider. It takes her until the end of the movie (and, since she's in her 90's, her life) to realize that she and Hoke are perhaps more similar than they thought.I recall that Dan Aykroyd did the role of Booley for union scale pay, he was so anxious to play a serious role; it paid off handsomely, as Dan was nominated for an academy award. Tandy is wonderful, and I don't think it's humanly possible for Morgan Freeman to turn in a bad performance. Some have criticized Freeman for being such a subservient character, but they also miss the point of what it was to be an older black servant in the 1950's. A fine effort and a great family movie.

Despite the fact that the story covers a 25-year period in just over an hour and a half, it isn't a movie that rushes the viewer.  Instead it proceeds at the comfortable pace of the southern-USA drawl characteristic of its Georgia setting.  Unfortunately for those who are unused to this particular accent, at times it is difficult to make out what is being said.  The unhurried feeling created is complemented by an excellent musical score - simple, light and almost whimsical, with a very catchy refrain.       The film follows the relationship (it would be too simplistic merely to call it friendship) between a widowed Jewish lady, Daisy Werthan, and her black chauffeur Hoke.  Miss Daisy is adamant she neither wants nor needs the driver, provided by her exasperated son to ensure she doesn't have any more car accidents.  However, over the next quarter century her frostiness thaws (albeit sporadically) and an understanding develops between this unlikely pair.        Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman well deserve the accolades they have received for their roles in this film.  These talented actors have to share the limelight though - with a truly magnificent classic car ensemble.  If you think modern cars are boring, it is worth viewing this film merely for the pleasure of seeing Miss Daisy's succession of cars - beautiful classic models from the late 1940s to the early 1970s - a time when cars truly deserved the title 'automobile'.

The film deals with a 25-year friendship between a widowed Jewish woman (Jessica Tandy in her Oscar-winning performance) and the black man who drives her around (Morgan Freeman in an Oscar-nominated role). Throughout the film we see their relationship change as the nation's outlook changes as well. They are friends from the late-1940s to the early-1970s and they live to see tragedy (a Jewish temple being bombed and Martin Luther King being killed) and triumph together (the Civil Rights movement giving equal rights to African-Americans). Dan Aykroyd (in an Oscar-nominated performance) does his best work as Tandy's son. Overall, the direction and screenplay are subtle but highly effective. The performances by the key players make the film very enjoyable. However, there are a few slight problems which keep the film from being as good as it could have been. Some things just do not gel quite as well as they could have. Overall a good film that was worthy of a Best Picture Oscar, but its lack of competition that year will likely make it become overlooked in the future. 4.5 out of 5 stars.

The rest of the film follows the pair through the remaining 25 years of their relationship.It doesn't sound like much but my God what a sweet film. I do not believe it is sentimentally so, either- very late in the film Daisy is still thoughtlessly treating Hoke like a lesser being.Q What is this movie ABOUT? A The nature of friendship, and race relations in the mid-20th century South.Film is for perhaps the opening half hour the least pleasant movie I can think of. Tandy character very unpleasant and Freeman character cartoonish. Writing like Variety now.But yes, it is an annoying film to start, and it's startling to think how completely it changes as it goes on, without your really noticing it's changed. It mirrors the relationship it depicts.I thought at first that Daisy's Jewishness was sort of a throw away detail and would not 'have to do' with the film, but I was wrong. Her Jewishness proves indeed to be a key to the character. One of the crucial developments in her friendship with Hoke is when they're both treated like trash by a couple of racist Alabama policemen. Solidarity!This is of course expanded upon when Daisy's synagogue being bombed prompts Hoke to tell her about a lynching he remembers from childhood. We get it, we get it.The film does gradually become more and more overtly about race relations (culminating, I think, with the two friends listening separately, for no good reason separately, to the King speech) yet remains throughout mostly about this friendship.There is that separateness. We wonder why, after so many years, do they eat separately? And our heart aches for them both, and for that time and place.The final scene is perfect. No more separateness.The acting in the film is superb. Morgan Freeman is a fine actor and his performance here reminds me of none of his others I've seen. Jessica Tandy, beautiful at 80, is very good in a very difficult role. She had to play an annoying, mean old woman at the beginning of this picture, and that's thankless, but she did it. Yet when the character revealed 'hidden depths' and her 'essential humanity', Tandy was wonderful. My favorite scenes of hers are during the trip to Alabama, first when she's shamed by the racist policemen, later when she's left in the car alone and, frightened, begins calling for Hoke. Her scenes of dementia at the end are handled skillfully and in them Tandy resists the temptation to go over the top, with the result that when she at last gathers herself and tells Hoke how much he means to her, it makes the movie.

In disparaging Daisy, many myths have sprung up that cloud the film's legacy and need addressing.1. Driving Miss Daisy won because 1989 was a weak year for movies - 1989 was a great year for movies. Among the films out that year which weren't even nominated for Best Picture were Glory, Henry V, Do The Right Thing, Parenthood, Batman, Crimes And Misdemeanors, The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen, sex, lies, and videotape, Steel Magnolias, and When Harry Met Sally. Unlike most years, any of the five Best Picture nominees could have won without anyone being too upset.2. Driving Miss Daisy is a syrupy feel-good exercise devoid of grit - While made in an artfully soft-focus and gentle style in keeping with the spirit we associate with the American South of recent bygone days, director Bruce Beresford and writer Alfred Uhry present us with a complicated and tricky story that challenges us right away. How many films get made showing old Jewish women complaining a poor black man stole a 33 cent can of salmon from her pantry? Daisy allows its central character to say some astounding things about blacks (They all take things, you know, They're like children,) and yet trusting us to have the tolerance to watch her grow.3. Driving Miss Daisy was popular because it features a passive black man - Morgan Freeman as Hoke gives a haunting, multi-layered performance of someone who is anything but passive. Because he is a black man in the Jim Crow South, he must make do working as a driver for Miss Daisy despite her resentment of him (which stems from her anger over her infirmity, not his skin color, to address another myth.) Hoke is a model of stoic patience, of finding silver linings and angles, and breaking down barriers through common sense. You needs a chauffeur and Lord knows I needs a job, is how he puts it to Miss Daisy. Now why don't we leave it at that? Of course, his patience with Miss Daisy over time yields more than a mere truce, not to mention a healthy raise and some fine used automobiles. And he retains his dignity in every scene.4. Driving Miss Daisy is mainly about race - Race is a theme, but the central theme is the passage of time. The film presents us with small vignettes, connected to seasons of the year, charting the growing relationship between Hoke and Daisy. As the characters age, we see every wrinkle on their skin and sense without anything being pointed out too strongly just how fragile and fleeting this thing called life really is. By film's end, long after race has been addressed, we are giving witness to the elusive pleasures of life in the face of Miss Daisy's mortality, a tough message for any movie to go out on, especially one as ultimately life-affirming as this.5. Jessica Tandy won her Oscar out of sympathy because of her age - She won it because she was good. Very good. Check out her scene when she tells Hoke about visiting the Gulf of Mexico and tasting the saltwater on her fingers, then snapping at herself for being so silly. Then you get winning zingers, delivered with impeccable vinegar, like this about her assimilated daughter-in-law If I had a nose like Florine, I wouldn't say Merry Christmas to anybody. Ouch! I actually am less won over by that famous line of hers, You're my best friend, because she makes the point so well with Hoke throughout the latter half of the film in many better ways.6. It's boring - Daisy runs only a little over 90 minutes, and makes the most of every one of them. Nothing runs too long. When a member of the household dies, you get a falling bowl and then a singing choir. When Daisy teaches Hoke to read, it's represented by a small sequence in a graveyard and then let go. It would seem abrupt on the pages of the script, yet Mark Warner's crafty editing and Hans Zimmer's deft score make it all seem so natural.7. Films like Driving Miss Daisy get made all the time - The only film that mixes comedy and pathos as effectively as this that I'm aware of is Being There.

Listening to Hoke relating the stories of growing up a black man in the south was very eye-opening.Daisy (Tandy) was very set in her ways and resisted any change.

She climbed into her car, threw it into reverse and accidentally backed it into the neighbor's yard. Her son Boolie had it towed out. Boolie was concerned about his mother and wanted to get her help, but Daisy was incorrigible! Boolie runs the Werthan Cotton factory in town. A man named Hoke Colburn came to see him one afternoon and after getting an elevator unstuck, Boolie and Hoke talked. Hoke is a chauffeur and Boolie wanted to hire him to drive his mother around. He knew she wouldn't like that idea but he gave it a shot. Hoke tried to prove himself by dusting the light bulbs and do gardening but Daisy simply shunned him. Then one afternoon she walked to the store even though Hoke offered to drive her. She walked to the trolley stop with Hoke following her in the car. She finally allowed him to drive her there. Along the way, she gave him a hard time about his driving but finally they make it. He also drives her to church services and she becomes angry with him for waiting out front because she was embarrassed at having a chauffeur. The two then go to the cemetery where Daisy's late husband was buried. She told Hoke to place some flowers on the Bauer grave, but Hoke said he couldn't read so Daisy helped him. She also gave him a beginners' book at Christmas even though she declared it wasn't a Christmas present.       Even though they continued to bicker, a friendship was beginning to form between Hoke and Daisy. Some years went by and Boolie bought Daisy a new car. He gave the old one to Hoke. Daisy was packing for her trip to Mobile, Alabama to celebrate her brother Walter's 90th birthday so when Hoke arrives, they hit the road. As soon as they enter Alabama, Hoke says it's the first time in his life that he's left Georgia. Along the way they meet with two bigoted cops and make a wrong turn so they have to go back but had to pull over because Hoke had to make water. Daisy was worried about being left in the car alone at night, but they finally make it to Walter's. Some more years go by and Daisy, Hoke and Boolie age some. Boolie's factory now has machines that replace the hand-workers. It was also on that day that Daisy's housekeeper, Idella, passed away so Hoke dropped by often to keep Daisy company. Daisy got yet another new car and one morning she and Hoke were driving to the temple when Hoke learned from a cop that somebody had bombed it.         One evening, Daisy was going to attend a speech by Dr. Martin Luther King and had invited Hoke and Boolie, however Boolie didn't wish to attend because his associates may think less of him. Daisy waits and asks Hoke when they're in the car and he declines so he waits in the car. And then, a few years later, Hoke came by to see Daisy who was in her 90's and quite geriatric. Quite sad really. She told Hoke that he was her best friend. And pretty soon, her house was sold and she moved into a retirement home and Hoke became too old to drive so he and Boolie went to visit a much older Daisy in the home where the two were still good friends.       A pretty good film. Jessica Tandy was superb. Her role won her an Academy Award! Morgan Freeman was great also and this was a break through role for Dan Aykroyd. He's usually in comedies but his character was quite likable in this movie. Don't let the video box throw you, Driving Miss Daisy isn't really a comedy. It does have funny parts like when Hoke and Daisy quarrel in the car and Aykroyd has some witty one-liners but this film is mostly a drama telling the tale of an unlikely friendship from 1948 to 1973. Also appearing in this film were Patti LuPone and Esther Rolle who is sadly no longer with us. She plaid Florida on the TV hits Maude and Good Times. Also, sadly, Jessica Tandy is no longer with us. She passed away in 1994 but we'll always remember her for her fantastic roles in movies like this. She starred with fellow veteran actor and husband Hume Cronyn in memorable films like Cocoon and Batteries Not Included! In conclusion, if you're a fan of the Alfred Uhry play and are a fan of Tandy or Freeman, I recommend Driving Miss Daisy!

The last shot (or dissolve)of the film still gets me every time, as it did the first.  There are no pat endings or oversentimentality here....it ends with a simple, beautiful scene that will linger in the memory for a long time.This is the type of film, if you truly love it, you can watch over and over, and its enjoyment will not diminish.Around this time, other great movies came out that left me  stunned and inspired, like Goodfellas and Dances with Wolves.

But, suffice to say, it has earned the praise given to it. Some may paint it as a picture of race relations, or even religious relations (there are Jews celebrating Christmas and a synagogue bombing). But it is really a tale of friendship and the race or religion aspects are very minor.Most interesting is the casting of Dan Aykroyd. He could easily have been dismissed as a bad idea, his very presence making this more of a comedy than it was intended to be. But by no means is this the case.

She drives her own car, but one day she makes a mistake and has an accident.

From that point Hoke, who is really tolerant, starts little by little a great friendship which lasts over 20 years.The director Bruce Beresford was great by putting together in a storyline line several domestic scenes where we can see how their appreciation for each other grows along all those years . The best make up Oscar was fair( as the years passed the actors were aging). The movie is great technically, but Jessica Tandy (Oscar winner) and Morgan Freeman's performance were just brilliant. Dan Aykroyd, as Boolie, often seen as a comedy actor, was just fine in this drama character as well.It's an inspirational story as we could see Daisy changing over the years to the point she states that Hoke was her best friend.

Driving Miss Daisy proves that. While undeniably simple in nature, Driving Miss Daisy is as sweet as movies get, and makes for a very pleasant experience.72 year old Miss Daisy is a Jewish widow who, after getting in a slight car accident, is given a chauffeur against her will. A black man named Hoke, the chauffeur seems to be off to a rough start with Miss Daisy, though instead, a beautiful relationship blossoms.I almost want to say that I'd like to see more movies as simple as Driving Miss Daisy. But I take it back, because a lot of Driving Miss Daisy's charm comes from the fact that it's simplicity is so rare in cinema, especially nowadays. The title character, Miss Daisy, comes off as a bit of a grump at first. And though her determined and prideful nature may be a bit irksome at first, you grow attached to her, much like Hoke. Hoke is a lively and kind-hearted chauffeur whose screen presence provides much of the humor in the movie. The chemistry and development between the two is done beautifully.While there's more than a little bit of formula, Driving Miss Daisy still feels fresh, and is touching without being overly sappy. It's a pitch perfect blend of subtle humor, romance, and sweetness.Acting is perfect. Jessica Tandy as Miss Daisy is perfectly disguised in the role, and Morgan Freeman is a great choice for Hoke. Dan Aykroyd as Miss Daisy's son, Boolie is also excellent.The score by Hans Zimmer is more than a little surprising. Known today for his work in blockbuster action movies, this much quieter and simpler score is a nice change of pace. While it's extremely dated, the two main themes (one jazzy, one sobering) are beautiful and memorable.Driving Miss Daisy will never be one of my favorite films, nor is it a film that I can see myself reaching for when I need something to watch. Regardless, this is an absolutely beautiful piece of cinema that I'm very glad I saw. It's easy-going sweetness and touching warmth is easily balanced with subtle humor, and it never gets overly schmaltzy. To top it all off, Driving Miss Daisy runs at a brisk 100 minute run time, so the thin plot never feels stretched. Driving Miss Daisy is no masterpiece, but it's one of the sweetest things I've ever seen.

It is a small film; one might even call it intimate, since the bulk of its hour-and-thirty-nine minute run time is devoted to the developing friendship between Daisy Werthan, a modestly wealthy retired Jewish schoolteacher (Jessica Tandy in the last role worthy of her, for which she would become the oldest winner of the Best Actress Oscar) and her African-American chauffeur Hoke Colburn (Morgan Freeman, without a doubt my choice for the greatest American actor still living and working in the business today; he was nominated for the Oscar as well, but I doubt anyone could have beaten Daniel Day-Lewis in his rather gimmicky turn as Christy Brown in MY LEFT FOOT).But I digress. The plot is easily summed up in just a few words the aging Miss Daisy, while attempting to drive to the market one day, has an accident with the car that is completely due to her own absent-mindedness but which she, in her typically stubborn way, attempts to blame on the car.Her devoted son Boolie (Dan Aykroyd in one of the best character roles he has ever had) fears for his mother's safety and decides that she must have a chauffeur. The headstrong Daisy vetoes the idea, giving as her reason a half-hearted protest that servants (and in this context in the South this means Negroes) steal things and can't be trusted. This despite the fact that she's had an African-American maid/cook, Idella (Esther Rolle in a performance of surpassing dignity), for decades. Obviously what Daisy fears is the loss of her independence; certainly she does not mean what she says about African-Americans; we sense it even as she says it.Boolie is not so easily swayed, however. Very much his mother's son, rather than butt heads with Daisy, he gets round the obstacle she puts up by hiring the chauffeur himself and paying his salary. Enter Morgan Freeman. He isn't young, either, but he needs a job, and he is no fool, either when an incident involving a stuck elevator attracts Boolie's attention to the man, Hoke quickly sizes up the situation and realizes that for once in his life he is actually in a position to hold out for better pay. And he will do this to Boolie a couple of times.Hoke shows up at Miss Daisy's home, but she will have none of him. She can't physically throw him out, and given that he was hired to perform a service, she certainly can't call the cops, so she chooses to ignore him at first, only speaking to him to remind him in an irritable tone that he isn't wanted. When she finds him occupying his time by cleaning her crystal chandelier, she tells him, You leave my things alone! An amusing line made even more so by Daisy's knowledge that she is stuck with him so long as Boolie is paying the bills, and by Hoke's response a softly-spoken yas'm after which he continues to work.My favorite moment comes when Daisy decides to walk to the store. In a flash Hoke is behind the wheel and as he drives slowly next to her, she says to him, What do you think you're doing? To which he responds, I'm trying to drive you to the store! Faced with an inevitability, Daisy finally gets in the car.All this happens fairly quickly, because director Beresford and writer Alfred Uhry are anxious to get to the relationship. Once in that car, she tacitly acknowledges that she is stuck with him, and though she acts cranky about it, she does not really put up a fight.The rest of the movie covers, over the course of several decades, the growing and developing friendship between the old lady and the servant. Discovering that he is illiterate, she takes it upon herself to teach him to read. On a long road trip from Atlanta to Mobile, Hoke pulls over to relieve himself at the side of the road (after delivering a blistering speech to Daisy about his manhood and humanity when she tries to stop him). Alone in the car, Daisy grows increasingly fearful and calls out Hoke's name twice. And later on, she speaks what may be the defining line of the film You're my best friend. She takes his hand when she says it, making a potentially maudlin line deeply significant and real.This is a beautiful film Beautifully photographed, sensationally acted by the entire cast (special mention must be made of Patti LuPone, screamingly funny as Boolie's wife Florine; I don't remember if she was a shiksa or simply an assimilationist, but Daisy can't stand her she celebrates Christmas with the gaudiest decorations you can imagine, and she certainly is a woman to whom money and status are important), and crafted by director Beresford into a flawless gem of a film that positively sparkles. Tandy, a national treasure, delivers one of her greatest performances, and Freeman, in the difficult role of servant, not only retains his dignity and his manhood, but captures our hearts as surely as he captures Miss Daisy's.A must-see.

The immense feeling of time, distance covered through friendship and through the years that have passed can flood all through your body if you watch it in just the right retrospect and at just the right time when you feel like watching a film of this quality, in this genre. Indeed, the feeling that I got was very much akin to that of the one during Forrest Gump as relationships and events that two people share unfold and present themselves; other similarities being that both are adaptations of written work and both centre on a relationship between two people.It seems no coincidence that both Forrest Gump and A Beautiful Mind won the Best Picture Oscar in their respective years and it should be no surprise that Driving Miss Daisy achieved the same feat before either of them. Set amongst Deep South USA in the 1940s, the film makes us aware that racism and the treatment of African American's as assistants is rife; albeit it not entirely evident. What's also effective about the presentation here is that although every black character has to answer to the whites without any argument, the white characters of Boolie (Aykroyd) and Daisy (Tandy) Werthan don't necessarily 'seem' racist and do not act in an as bigoted way as they could've done. The film could've made a horrid mistake and presented us with the material it decided to take on in a clumsy and racist manner but it makes the right decision to tell us it's there without being to nasty. That said instead of racism; the white characters are presented as merely busy or uncertain. When Boolie first meets Hoke (Freeman), he doesn't pay much attention to him probably due to his ethnic colour and yet from that point on, he has the utmost respect for him; evident in scenes such as when he is not ignoring Hoke but merely rushing for work and consequently, can't chat even though he'd love to.Typically, Daisy is not bigoted towards Hoke the first time they meet but merely unsure. Here is an elderly woman; born in the 1880s, living in a big old house on her own and her son shows up with a strange and new man to drive her around. Daisy may be incapacitated enough not to be able to cook and clean as her other house servant would suggest but one thing she believes she can still do is drive a car although evidence taken from the very first scene of the film suggests otherwise. This then, would rightfully anger her when her son turns up with someone to drive her around as Daisy believes it's the one remaining things she likes to think she can do thus; she isn't hostile toward Hoke because he's black but because he's being used as a pawn to takeover what one thing she can do. It isn't racist (although it would seem like it) but merely frustrating &#150; if Hoke was white; Daisy's reaction would've been exactly the same. So Driving Miss Daisy is a film that acknowledges racism amongst the time its set but ignores it through the rest of the film bar the dialogue Hoke must constantly say and the seemingly hostile sheriffs Daisy and Hoke encounter which makes for a great scene in itself.Driving Miss Daisy is a relationship film at its core but it's one built on respect for one another over a period of time and aid that each can give one another. Hoke can drive Daisy to the shops or to birthday parties in another state and in return, a touching scene in which Hoke admits his illiteracy and Daisy makes a slight attempt to teach him words and letters. At the very beginning I expect Hoke liked Daisy as a friend about as much as she liked him but over time; trust and companionship prevails and an excellent scene in the film plays out over a can of supposedly stolen salmon which Hoke apparently stole. The important thing at the end of this scene is that although set up as a golden chance for antagonistic behaviour towards 'the thieving black man'; it actually ends in Hoke admitting to it, apologising and presenting a new can without too much of a fuss &#150; honesty and humane treatment for fellow man prevails.Driving Miss Daisy is a film that will tantalise those among us that like dialogue driven dramas; period pieces and films that resemble luxurious deserts with just enough sugar sprinkled on top (but never too much) to enjoy time from time again. The costumes and era authenticities are brilliant with the years changing through in-film references instead of hammy captions that could've popped up. The iconography and mise-en-scene for the respective times play an important role in the film; the purchasing of a new car for Daisy and the invention of the television just two examples that progress the film through time as well as relations between people. This is a film that will look just as good in twenty years and one that will play out just as heart-warmingly if you watch it correctly.

This information is--according to my research--incorrect. Willie Sleep-N-Eat Best did appear in a few musicals--the one that most quickly comes to mind is his attempt to sing a few lines in the Ice Cold Katie number from the WWII Warner's star studded classic,Thank Your Lucky Stars. That film also featured the vocal expertise of Hattie McDaniels and, no doubt, was intended to be the WB version of Hollywood Canteen.The true author/composer of I Love You For Sentimental Reasons was musician named William Pat Best, who was a vocalist, guitarist, and songwriter. He wrote the song as a member of the Brown Dots in 1945. This was the group formed by singer Deek Watson after he left the Ink Spots in something other than an amiable departure. His name also appears on the song as co-author. After the Brown Dots, William Pat Best went on to another group, backing sultry singer Savannah Churchill. The group started out as The Sentimentalists, but after their first hit backing Savannah (I Want to be Loved, But By Only You...also written by Pat Best), they morphed into The Four Tunes. This group was very popular in the late 1940s into the early or mid '50s, and had a number of well known recordings.I don't know that Willie Sleep-N-Eat Best had a musical or songwriting career...that's research that I will leave to someone else.

Freeman's character is instantly likable and Tandy's character is, well... she's not likable. As Hoke represents, in part, her lost freedom, much of her hostility is directed at him, however, she is not shy about verbally terrorizing anyone. Being that he needs a job (and the job is probably very good for that place and time), Hoke silently suffers the many indignities she hurls his way. In time, we come to see that, whether or not she knows it, Miss Daisy is also a victim of prejudice, albeit of another kind. As the decades pass (and new cars come and go), their shared experiences and growing dependence on each other result in subtle, but significant changes -- in Miss Daisy's view of the world and her treatment of Hoke; and Hoke's constant, gentle care of Miss Daisy and his refusal to be considered or treated any less than the man he is. Both undergo tremendous personal growth as the years roll on. One unexpected surprise in this movie is Dan Akroyd. Normally I avoid any movie in which his name appears. His role in this movie is perfectly performed and he brings a warmth to the movie I would not have expected from him. In this role, he proved himself to be a very capable actor. It's a shame he hasn't picked better roles for himself over the years.

It tells of how a chauffeur (Morgan Freeman, in another great role) starts driving for Miss Daisy (Jessica Tandy, Oscar-winner for this film) who will not drive anymore after an accident in her driveway. Though Miss Daisy does not take an immediate liking to Freeman and does not want to have to be driven around, the two begin to grow closer together and become more friendly over the years. There are just so many great little scenes that really make this film what it is. My personal favorite scene involves Miss Daisy teaching Freeman to spell so he can find a grave site she is looking for. The interactions between the two of them are brilliant here and the scene is made entirely believable by their great acting. The scene in which Miss Daisy, as she is getting older, starts to lose her memory and thinks she is still a teacher, as she was in her younger years, truly tugs at the heartstrings, but is perfectly done and is another one of the film's best scenes. Perhaps not the Best Picture of 1989 for me, and it does tend to be a little slow at times, but it is truly a worthwhile film, and a must-see for just about any movie lover.

So I rented it today and I just watched it and I have to say that this film just touched my heart and was so incredible. The most unlikely of friends who are entering the same stages of life was not the most original plot, but it worked so well with the way Jessica and Morgan played off each other. The film was so well made and not to mention the acting was just so lovely, it's just so hard to resist this film.Daisy is an elderly Jewish woman who cannot drive any more after a little fender bender, but her son Boogie who is a very rich man, hires Hoke, an elderly black man who can still drive and will help her around the house somewhat. Daisy is just plain stubborn, especially after Hoke makes certain judgments on her lifestyle, but he soon comes to realize who she is, not to mention the other way around. Hoke helps Daisy come to terms with how the world is changing and how she may just need him around, considering that he is her only best friend in the world.Driving Miss Daisy, how could this film not be in the top 250? It's just a wonderful film that I'm sure anyone and I really do mean anyone could love. I didn't understand how anyone could rate this movie anything lower than a 9.

I loved the way that her relationship with Hoke changed from enemies ( I don't need your help and I don't want it!) to the greatest of friends. (you're my best friend Hoke). This movie definitely deserved to be nominated as best picture (and it was, in 1994, but sadly, it didn't win.

The Academy has given the award to films that touch on racial prejudice, such as this film and the disappointing web-life film Crash (which won against a much more brilliant film, Brokeback Mountain, which touches on prejudice of sexual orientation) most likely because it is a safe pick. This film is one of those safe picks which does not do much visually, but manages to depict the great heartwarming story of the play on which it is based.Driving Miss Daisy may not be the most exciting film, but it has a story that is easy to follow as well as a very short duration regarding the typical feature film, keeping anybody engaged as long as the audience cares about characters and their growth within stories. Daisy is depicted as a prejudiced person in denial early in the film, and it is actually quite humorous how she interacts with Hoke (Morgan Freeman) before he becomes her driver. She is a selfish elderly woman who doesn't realize what she is saying at times, and stubborn as a mule, not taking Hoke's help (paid for by her son, played by Dan Aykroyd) until 6 days pass.As Hoke and Daisy spend time with each other they come to learn from each other with great benefit. When it is revealed that Hoke can't read, instead of being uptight with him about it Daisy explains it in a clever way only a previous school teacher like her can do it. Just a few minutes later, a lot of time has passed and it is revealed she is now giving him a book to help him write, so Hoke is overcoming some pretty important struggles with Daisy's help.Hoke warms up to Daisy through the second act of the film, but it takes Aykroyd's character suggesting she let Hoke come to a meeting about Martin Luther King Jr. to get her to understand Hoke's feelings. Daisy gets into a mini-quarrel with Hoke about this, and you can see it in her eyes she regrets that she didn't invite him to such an important event in the eyes of an African American like Hoke. Towards the finale of the film, it is heartbreaking to hear Daisy admit that Hoke is her best friend while she is suffering from what appears to be dementia, and though Hoke says she is only saying that, she assures him it is true.Time goes by quickly in this movie, and in order to keep up with the time you have to pay attention to the years of the various cars, the graying of Dan Aykroyd's hair, or the change in abilities of Hoke and/or Daisy. This is much more interesting than the annoying titles often used in films to remind people that time has passed - this way it does not make the audience feel like a group of idiots. The only thing I found visually interesting about the film is a scene between Daisy and her son in which mirrors are employed to show what is happening in the room for a lengthy take, and the rest of the cinematography in the movie makes it feel simple, with more focus on the characters than the technique as in a play.Still a great story with two great leads.

But the story dismisses that without omitting the value of the issue by reducing the duration yet showing strong scenes of the issue. One thing that amazes me is Morgan Freeman's acting skills. He can really get the old character acting well. Seeing his more recent works, having him being far older thirsty years, amazes me that his acting and stamina for character is just as great, if not greater than, as he was in this movie.

Her concerned and loving son (Dan Ackroyd) decides to go behind her back and hires a black chauffeur for her. At first, Miss Daisy goes out of her way to get rid of Hoke (Morgan Freeman), the aging and proud chauffeur, but as the dangers of a politically changing society explodes around them, their initially antagonistic relationship turns into something special.A simple sounding plot that really isn't so simple, and is presented with tenderness and understanding for both aging characters. Miss Daisy is the product of a disappearing South where gentle white folk didn't have anything to do with the poor blacks around them until the civil rights fight exploded, bringing war between some and peace between others. It's the later for Daisy and Hoke, and the result is a touching friendship that lasts decades and overcomes not only racial barriers but religious barriers as well.When I first saw this in its big screen release, I was very touched, not only by what was going on in the movie, but what was going on with the audience as well. A racially mixed audience was sharing a moment together, much like they do in live theater, where members of each race present sobbed together and really felt a connection that transcends all of society's differences. You really feel for both characters as their mutual respect grows, even when Miss Daisy is insulting and demanding with Hoke, you know exactly where she is coming from and understand why she is the way she is. As she ages and her fragility's increase, it is the relationship between them that sustains her, not that with her own son.A surprisingly strong dramatic performance by the comic Dan Ackroyd is a delight, and Broadway diva Patti LuPone scores in her few scenes as Miss Daisy's ridiculously vain daughter-in-law who seems like someone out of the recent hit film The Help. Also worthy of note is Esther Rolle who adds quiet dignity to the role of the aging cook/housekeeper, and her final scene is truly emotional. The film intertwines both comedy and drama with real-life history to make an unforgettable drama that transcends all of society's prejudices and shows us we can all become better human beings only through compassion and understanding.

On Broadway Jessica was the original Blanche Dubois in A Streetcar Named Desire and was the only one of the original cast who didn't make the trip to Hollywood with Vivien Leigh playing Blanche and winning a second Oscar for it. But there is a universe of difference between Blanche Dubois and Daisy Werthing and it ain't just age.In fact Tandy may play the only role film history where you start at 70 and then age in the part. She's a genteel southern woman, but formidable who happens to be Jewish. One day she has an accident and emerges unhurt, but the car is wrecked and son Dan Aykroyd decides that his mother needs a chauffeur. An idea not pleasing to Tandy as she's used to doing for herself. Even the presence of Esther Rolle as a cook was upsetting to her, but Rolle toughed it out and became a household fixture. So when Aykroyd hires Morgan Freeman to be a driver, Freeman will have his work cut out for him.The success of Driving Miss Daisy is really dependent on the chemistry between Tandy and Freeman. You haven't got that and the film would sink. Fortunately they click beautifully together.Author Alfred Uhry grew up in the Atlanta of the time and Atlanta was relatively a beacon of some light in the cracker and segregated south of the time. Mayor William B. Hartsfield of the period always advertised his city as the one too busy to hate. Given the parameters of the times, Hartsfield moved to gradually end segregation and to improve the services for Atlanta's black population. Hartsfield is mentioned in passing in the film. Remember Tandy's character is Jewish, a people not looked on too fondly either by a lot of the Deep South. But in Atlanta they have some measure of safety.Uhry's memories yielded him a Pulitzer Prize winning play and an Academy Award Best film. He also got an Oscar for adapting his off Broadway success to the screen. Of course Jessica Tandy became the oldest player to ever receive an acting Oscar. And Driving Miss Daisy also got an Oscar for Best Makeup. And it was nominated for Best Art&Set Direction, Best Editing, Best Costumes with Oscar nods for Morgan Freeman for Best Actor and Dan Aykroyd for Best Supporting Actor. For Freeman his best moment comes when on a trip to Mobile,Alabama with Tandy he puts up with the indignities and humiliation of segregation and exposes Tandy to a world she really wasn't aware of. And Tandy got her Oscar for the moment when she and those around her realize that Alzheimer's Disease has gotten control. For an elderly player to even contemplate such a thing that could so easily happen to them must be a nerve wracking experience. Jessica Tandy saw in her life such colleagues as Rita Hayworth, Dana Andrews, and Edmond O'Brien among others lose their last few years and careers to the long lingering twilight of Alzheimer's, no doubt she drew from all of them and her own fears that it could happen to her to deliver this performance.Driving Miss Daisy is one of the best films of the last half of the last century and one that will be studied and revived for years to come. Budding actors who need chemistry lessons should study what is working between Tandy and Freeman.

Her son, Boolie(Dan Ackroyd) hires her a chauffeur named Hoke Colburn(Morgan Freeman) who is a very good driven, but he has one flaw; he's illiterate. Those two are out and about, and going places she could possibly would have done back then. She was a little scared when Hoke went out of the car just to make water. Long drives can fill the bladder. As time goes by, they travel cross-country in the American South, until Miss Daisy starts to suffer from old age. The most touching scene to me was when she says, Hoke, you're my best friend. She was very serious about it! It goes to show that places like the South isn't always as negative as it was told. Some cities and towns have their bright spots. This is another eye-opening movie since A Patch of Blue, and it's a big keeper in my collection! 5 stars!

However, as the years progress, their friendship becomes strong.The racial references are critical to the era in which the story takes place. While the comments are politically incorrect by today's standards, censorship or the removal of specific elements would reduce the realism in this excellent movie. Furthermore, the portrayal of bigotry in this film demonstrates the progress American society has made since the early to mid twentieth century.You will enjoy every detail in Driving Miss Daisy, from the top notch acting, the antique automobiles, Miss Daisy's southern home (you can even call it a mansion), the comedy, and the drama.

With such wonderful roles to play, any skilled actor/actress can put their hearts into them - but, I defy any others to trump Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman. These two had a natural for these roles - Jessica a fabulous actress still into her old age and Freeman giving a performance he'd never done. I'm a Southerner - the scenery was like looking out my window at home. One of the most touching scenes in this movie was not Tandy's mad scene, but when Hoke shows-up with coffee-donuts during a snow-storm.......that's where the friendship really became cemented, and the scene in the cemetery. If you hadn't cried buckets by that time, you are truly not aware how sweet life can be, even with the extremities of Miss Daisy's and Hoke's lives. People who let their wealth define their humanity are such shallow people - it takes folk like Hoke to define and SHOW that humanity comes even to the lowest class - and what a nasty, uncharacteristic statement that is from me. Those other people in this movie just let us have a comparison to bounce-off those two genuine characters. Bravo to everyone who had a part in making this timeless film - I'm giving it 20-of-10......

History impacts all of us in its own way. This film is really about two very different characters finding common grounds and eventually friendship.In my opinion, there's no evidence that Miss Daisy is racist (any more than most well-intended people unconsciously are). Her resistance to Hoke isn't racial; her resistance to Hoke comes from her dogged independence. Any racism that does exist creeps in through the eaves of Miss Daisy's character as contradictory asides, and isn't central to it.Another reviewer made much of the fact that all the servants had to call her Miss Daisy, not bothering to learn that all southern women of a certain age are given that title. Jimmy Carter's mother was eternally Miss Lillian. My great-grandmother's childhood friend (an African-American lady) was Miss Marigold.I find it interesting that, in arguing against the film's Hollywood depiction (not a simplistic, trite moment in the lot, nor a car chase) there is an assumption of what makes for American films...a racist assessment in and of itself while arguing against racism.

With Uhry's own adapted screenplay, most of the slippery slopes endemic to the world of the broadened mise-en-scene are skillfully negotiated. The result is a cleanly executed, lyrically fashioned phrase that is as engaging along the way as it is rewardingly resolute at it's sweet conclusion. It is a moving portrait of the process wherein hearts and minds are the reflection of as well as the guts-and-glory energy behind meaningful societal change. It is slow-motion revolution and evolution, on the outside and inside, respectively.The two central characters, Morgan Freeman's Hoke and Jessica Tandy's Daisy, are not challengingly complex, but, with the sharp and seasoned instincts of the two actors, we see that they are, by no means, easy to figure or without mystery. The script, line for line, is economical with an unforced colloquialism that frame and bring to full efficiency their crafty nuances. It's those tiny, twitchy surprises that keep us curious for each moment, while maintaining a relaxed familiarity that is necessary for us to get to know and care for these two fateful companions.Like your elderly and eccentric uncle or aunt who may gracefully stumble and sternly stammer their gradual way around the bend, they provocatively engage, entertain and sometime irritate us with unpredictability until we are reminded, with an unexpected word or raised eyebrow, that they've lived longer, seen more and know better.

What we are studying is both the character of the leads and the character of a way of life passing languidly before our eyes. Adapted for the screen from his Pulitzer Prize winning stage play by Alfred Uhry and directed by Bruce Beresford, who previously gave us the remarkable Aussie classic, Breaker Morant (1980), Driving Miss Daisy is one of those films that is a work of art as well as a sociological discovery. Using beautifully constructed scenes carefully observed, Beresford allows us to recall a way of life and a culture that characterized the South during the middle of the last century. Freeman's Hoke Colburn is black; and, as he mumbles, not all that much has changed since the days of slavery. He still has to yes'em and shuffle his feet and show deference to white folk just to get by. Miss Daisy Werthan herself is rich and very tight with her money. She is also as racially prejudiced as a Dixie sheriff, but blind to her prejudices as she rages against the infirmaries of age. The movie begins as she loses control of her car and drives it off the road and into a drainage ditch. She is shaken but unharmed. However her driving days are over. Her son Boolie Werthan, played with a fine touch and surprising restraint by comedian Dan Aykroyd, decides to get her a chauffeur. But she will not hear of it. She feels her independence is being threatened, and she doesn't need her son to tell her what to do. She can take care of herself. When Boolie arrives with Hoke, who is clearly black, Miss Daisy declares she will not have that man in her house. One feels very strongly at this point how compromised the infirm are when they must rely on help from others. Let a stranger into your house and there is no telling where it might end. More that this though, is the underlying idea that dependence on people from a lower social-economic class will in fact have a leveling effect on class distinctions, and this is again something that Miss Daisy (in her ignorance of herself) will not abide. But Hoke says he has wrestled some hogs in the mud in his time and has yet to let one get away, and he will do what is necessary to secure his position as Miss Daisy's driver. He comes highly recommended, and after listening to him, Boolie has little doubt he got the right man for the job. Miss Daisy of course is having none of it, and indeed she tells him to get out. She refuses to get into the car; she won't let him clean the chandelier or weed her garden. However, he doesn't give up. He takes all of her contrariness with good spirit and a sunny attitude, and then one day as she tries to go shopping on foot, he follows alongside of her in the car, and after some walking she is persuaded to hop in. On one level this is about racial politics in the South, circa mid- twentieth century, and on another level it is about growing old and coping with life as one grows old. It is about taking care of oneself and getting the most out of life despite the handicap of a declining body. This applies to both Hoke and Miss Daisy. He knows that the physical demands of a chauffeur are more appropriate to his age than some of the physical work he did when younger, and she knows that to live the full social life that she desires, she needs help in getting around. Naturally, as the film progresses they learn from one another. At first they are drawn together by her sharp wit and his appreciation of somebody who can speak the truth with a barb and not mince words. Later they are drawn closer together by their mutual strength of character and the plain fact that she needs a driver and he needs a job. But finally they are drawn together because they become, as she suddenly observes one day, best friends. This then is a story of love as well--love between two people from different walks of life. The differences are not just those of race and socio-economic status, or of religion and gender, but of world views and personal psychology, hers demanding and exacting, highbrow and imperial, his practical and easy-going, naturistic and democratic. A tide is turned when her temple is burned to the ground by the same ones as always as Hoke informs her, which forces Daisy to realize that her enemies are the same as his. Consequently she attends a speech given by Martin Luther King, Jr. He prefers to wait outside in the car and listen to it on the radio. At once we see the commonality of their understanding, but still the differences of their stations in life remain. The dream and the reality are meshing but slowly, as all things do in the Old South, or, for that matter, most anywhere. See this above all for the captivating performances by Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman, two of the great actors of our time, and for the touching and bittersweet story by Alfred Uhry. Also noteworthy is director Beresford's careful attention to detail and his unobtrusive guidance so that the film flows as sweetly as Tupelo honey on a warm southern day.

Miss Daisy herself is a perfect example of someone who has lived their entire life in denial of certain aspects of themselves. Hoke represents a perfect picture of a true gentlemen, sticking with Miss Daisy because he saw her need for him, though she would never acknowledge it.

An amazing film set in the suburbs of Atlanta from the early 1950's to 1970's, it is brilliantly acted with Jessica Tandy portraying the curmudgeonly Daisy and Morgan Freeman her long suffering chauffeur, Hoke. Both remarkable stars fully deserve all the accolades received for these roles. Dan Akroyd plays Daisy's son, Boolie, a busy businessman trying to keep his mother's life sorted out. Esther Rolle is Daisy's likable maid, Idella, who has an endearing fondness for the soap operas. Personally, I also love the Southern setting and the wonderful cinematography.The story focuses on the developing friendship between the wealthy Jewish, Miss Daisy, and her poor, African American chauffeur, Hoke. At first Miss Daisy most definitely does NOT wish to be driven, merely agreeing to a chauffeur to humour her son, Boolie, who is busy running the family business. He worries about his aging mother's deteriorating driving skills, especially after she has a little driving 'mishap' on her own driveway and the insurance companies refuse to insure her anymore. At first Daisy stubbornly refuses to be driven about anywhere by Hoke, but eventually comes very reluctantly to grudgingly tolerate her new chauffeur. However, gradually over a period of 20 or more years, frosty tolerance of her chauffeur evolves into a certain affection and dependence, and eventually best friendship, as Daisy grows closer in fact to Hoke than to her own son. The two characters are vividly drawn with wonderful, touching humour as the pair interact. Miss Daisy is prim, fussy, contrary, and cantankerous, a bit embarrassed about her wealth, and constantly making it abundantly clear that she doesn't need help with any of her affairs, thank you. At first she doesn't trust Hoke and at one point even suspects him of petty theft. Especially in those early years, she gives every indication that she has no appreciation whatsoever of her kind, loyal, and incredibly patient chauffeur. When the aging Daisy becomes a wee bit forgetful, it is Hoke who unobtrusively saves the day. The pair share a memorable road trip in her Cadillac to Alabama for Daisy's brother's 90th birthday party, getting a little lost en route and encountering some racist police officers.Despite her own experiences with anti Semitic prejudice, Daisy has lived her life immersed in a world where blacks have long been considered inferior and is bigoted herself, though she is of course quite oblivious to the fact. The racial issue between them is particularly well portrayed, even with a background of changing racial attitudes and the civil rights movement in the South. When the temple where Daisy worships is burned to the ground, she comes to realize that she and Hoke share a common enemy...mindless bigotry and hatred.Miss Daisy and Hoke form a bond despite their differences in race, gender, religion, financial status, personality, and attitudes. This is a beautiful classic film that gives us a glimpse into the human souls of two very different people...or are they? Unfolding portrayals show that in fact, at their core these two aren't so different after all. By the film's end, both are getting to quite an age, Daisy (in her 60's at the beginning) now especially geriatric. The closing pumpkin pie scenes are among the most touching anywhere in the cinematic world and will bring a lump to your throat. This is a truly wonderful, unique, and moving portrait of a most extraordinary relationship.

There is something about this movie that makes it such a classic, and is incomparable to any other like it, in the same film category.Set at the beginning of the film, in the early 1950's, Daisy (Tandy), a woman in her early to mid 80's, crashes her car in the backyard, leaving her son, Buelly (Akroyd), to find her a driver.

Even after losing the way she doesn't give him an authority to find the way. I knew black people couldn't use any facility places in 1950s and 60s. However I realized that fro the first time when he said I can't go to any service station. Two polices men also ignore them as a race and an age. There are many values to think. This film shows me an American history and a love that transcends all of the things.

Her son, Boolie (Oscar nominated Dan Aykroyd) still keeps Hoke anyway. He just keeps driving her, and secretly or purposely doing housework, e.g. cleaning lamps.

Jessica Tandy plays Daisy Werthan, an elderly southern Jewish woman who has gotten to the point where she can't drive anymore. So, her son Boolie (Dan Aykroyd, in an interesting serious role) hires black man Hoke Colburn (Morgan Freeman) to drive her. At first, she's of course averse to having a black man drive her, but over the years, she grows to respect him.The movie's two scenes that really stuck in my memory were when Daisy's synagogue is bombed, and when the cops stop Hoke. After the synagogue is bombed, Daisy tells Hoke about it, and he knows that the Ku Klux Klan is behind it, having experienced their terror firsthand. When the cops stop Hoke, they naturally call him boy (despite the fact that he's much older than either of them), and Daisy has to hide her ethnic background. Still, the cops consider it a sorry sight that an old (N-word) and an old Jewish woman are in a car together.I guess that this isn't the greatest movie about race relations, but it is certainly worth seeing.

Get it at Amazon.)Take an intense and flawless performance by Jessica Tandy (80-years-old when the movie was released in 1989) and a charming and slyly witty performance by Morgan Freeman (closing in on his fifties)--she a rich Jewish lady of the South, high-toned, spoiled, stubborn to a fault, he a black illiterate chauffeur, wise, patient and in need of a job--and we have the basis for a profound character study.Adapted for the screen from his Pulitzer Prize winning stage play by Alfred Uhry and directed by Bruce Beresford, who previously gave us the remarkable Aussie classic, Breaker Morant (1980), Driving Miss Daisy is one of those films that is a work of art as well as a sociological discovery. Using beautifully constructed scenes carefully observed, Beresford allows us to recall a way of life and a culture that characterized the South during the middle of the last century. Freeman's Hoke Colburn is black; and, as he mumbles, not all that much has changed since the days of slavery. He still has to yes'em and shuffle his feet and show deference to white folk just to get by. Miss Daisy Werthan herself is rich and very tight with her money. She is also as racially prejudiced as a Dixie sheriff, but blind to her prejudices as she rages against the infirmaries of age.The movie begins as she loses control of her car and drives it off the road and into a drainage ditch. She is shaken but unharmed. However her driving days are over. Her son Boolie Werthan, played with a fine touch and surprising restraint by comedian Dan Aykroyd, decides to get her a chauffeur. But she will not hear of it. She feels her independence is being threatened, and she doesn't need her son to tell her what to do. She can take care of herself. When Boolie arrives with Hoke, who is clearly black, Miss Daisy declares she will not have that man in her house.One feels very strongly at this point how compromised the infirm are when they must rely on help from others. Let a stranger into your house and there is no telling where it might end. More that this though, is the underlying idea that dependence on people from a lower social-economic class will in fact have a leveling effect on class distinctions, and this is again something that Miss Daisy (in her ignorance of herself) will not abide.But Hoke says he has wrestled some hogs in the mud in his time and has yet to let one get away, and he will do what is necessary to secure his position as Miss Daisy's driver. He comes highly recommended, and after listening to him, Boolie has little doubt he got the right man for the job. Miss Daisy of course is having none of it, and indeed she tells him to get out. She refuses to get into the car; she won't let him clean the chandelier or weed her garden. However, he doesn't give up. He takes all of her contrariness with good spirit and a sunny attitude, and then one day as she tries to go shopping on foot, he follows alongside of her in the car, and after some walking she is persuaded to hop in.On one level this is about racial politics in the South, circa mid- twentieth century, and on another level it is about growing old and coping with life as one grows old. It is about taking care of oneself and getting the most out of life despite the handicap of a declining body. This applies to both Hoke and Miss Daisy. He knows that the physical demands of a chauffeur are more appropriate to his age than some of the physical work he did when younger, and she knows that to live the full social life that she desires, she needs help in getting around. Naturally, as the film progresses they learn from one another. At first they are drawn together by her sharp wit and his appreciation of somebody who can speak the truth with a barb and not mince words. Later they are drawn closer together by their mutual strength of character and the plain fact that she needs a driver and he needs a job. But finally they are drawn together because they become, as she suddenly observes one day, best friends.This then is a story of love as well--love between two people from different walks of life. The differences are not just those of race and socio-economic status, or of religion and gender, but of world views and personal psychology, hers demanding and exacting, highbrow and imperial, his practical and easy-going, naturistic and democratic.A tide is turned when her temple is burned to the ground by the same ones as always as Hoke informs her, which forces Daisy to realize that her enemies are the same as his. Consequently she attends a speech given by Martin Luther King, Jr. He prefers to wait outside in the car and listen to it on the radio. At once we see the commonality of their understanding, but still the differences of their stations in life remain. The dream and the reality are meshing but slowly, as all things do in the Old South, or, for that matter, most anywhere.See this above all for the captivating performances by Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman, two of the great actors of our time, and for the touching and bittersweet story by Alfred Uhry. Also noteworthy is director Beresford's careful attention to detail and his unobtrusive guidance so that the film flows as sweetly as Tupelo honey on a warm southern day.

Maybe I would have understood it if I lived during that time, maybe if I knew anyone who were at the very age of the main characters. It starts off looking like a pretty good comedy, but after the first ten minutes or so, the pace goes incredibly slow, and stays slow for the rest of the film. The developing relationship between Tandy and Freeman was good, but I never found myself liking or even just slightly caring about the character of Daisy, or what happened to her. Maybe I'm too intolerant, but I honestly couldn't stand her... and that's a real problem, since she's on-screen for the better part of the film. The plot is fairly good, but it moves so slowly that it's hard to pay attention to it, unless you really understand and feel for either or both of the main characters, neither of which I did during the film. The acting is all pretty good, with Tandy and Freeman giving outstanding performances(which is pretty much the only thing that made the film watchable for me). The humor is almost non-existent(had to mention it, this being part comedy, after all). All in all, probably good for those who can remember the times when this is set, and/or those who are about the same age as either of the two leads. Barely watchable, had it not been for the acting, for everyone else.

Daisy Werthan is a cantankerous widow, a long-retired teacher, who lives in the family's large home with a black woman servant, Idella. She is wealthy but is frugal from her upbringing. The film makes it a point that she and her son, Boolie, are Jewish. Hoke Colburn is a genial uneducated black man, wise for his age and experience. After Daisy has an accident that totals her car, she can no longer drive. Boolie hires Hoke to be her driver. I missed this film when it came out in theaters; and looked forward to watching it on DVD.While the focus is on the two stars, played exceptionally well by Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman, the movie has a clear message and judgment of the people and place at the time. Racial segregation yet was the standard in the South, and the movement for ending the last shackles of slavery &#x96; segregation and discrimination &#x96; was just coming to life. Toward the end of the film, when she is nearing her 90th birthday, she attends a dinner at an antebellum estate or hall. The speaker is Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. While we don't see MLK, we hear part of his speech as the scene switches between Daisy and other people at dinner tables, and Hoke sitting alone in the car outside and listening to the talk on the radio. . But first, on the drive to the dinner, Daisy says to Hoke, Boolie said you wanted to go with me to this dinner. Did you tell him that? Hoke, No, ma'am, I didn't. Daisy, I didn't think so. What'd be the point? You can hear him whenever you want. I think it's wonderful the way things are changin'. After they arrive, they have an exchange and Hoke gets out of the car and says to himself, Talk about things changin'. They ain't changed all that much.In the dining room, we see Daisy and the other dinner guests &#x96; white and black &#x96; looking off screen as MLK speaks. Yet, there are in the white South, millions of people of good will whose voices are yet unheard, whose course is yet unclear, and whose courageous acts are yet unseen. These millions are called upon to gird their courage to speak out. To offer leadership that is needed. History will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the vitriolic words and the violent actions of the bad people, but the appalling silence and indifference of the good people. Our generation will have to repent not only for the words and acts of the children of darkness but also for the fears and apathy of the children of light. (This speech by MLK Jr took place on January 2, 1965, in Atlanta, Georgia.)As Jews, Daisy and Boolie know a little about prejudice and injustice. The Holocaust of World War II was fresh in the public mind. Yet, their Jewishness doesn't appear to have hurt them in anyway. Boolie receives a man-of-the-year award in Atlanta. Yet, he worries that going to the MLK dinner could affect his business &#x96; some of which might move over to a Jew from New York. They both say they aren't prejudiced, and Boolie is very kind and respectful toward blacks. But, Daisy has grown up with prejudice that she doesn't recognize. When she finds that a can of salmon was missing, she suspects Hoke. She says, that kind can't be trusted. As the years pass, Daisy becomes more friendly with Hoke. But, at the dinner, as she listened to MLK speak, did Daisy ask herself if she had bothered to lift a finger to help end segregation? Or, had she been a part of the apathy and indifference?In the closing scene, Hoke and Boolie visit Daisy two years after she has moved to a retirement home. She sends Boolie off, so she and Hoke can talk. She tells Hoke, You're my best friend. Hoke says, Oh, look. You haven't eaten your Thanksgiving pie. Daisy smiles and fumbles for a spoon. Hoke says, Here, let me help you. He offers a spoon of pie and she eats it slowly. Then another bite, and another, and the music plays as the film ends. That was a powerful scene to me. An uneducated black man of the South, gently spoon-feeding an aged wealthy, white woman of the South who, so slowly even in old age, came to change her ways.Jessica Tandy surely deserved her best actress Oscar. The movie won four Oscars in 1989, including best picture. Morgan Freeman surely was deserving of his best actor nomination. But, his competition was very strong, including great performances by Kenneth Branagh in Henry V and by the winner, Daniel Day-Lewis, in My Left Foot. I enjoy Freeman in all his movies I've seen. He's so often cast as the president, or a senator, or an organization head in action and mystery films. It's good to see him in a film in which he more fully can use his wonderful acting skills. Dan Aykroyd is excellent as Boolie. The producers must have rented all the 1940s and 1950s vintage cars they could find for the various driving and street scenes. I wonder if a short scene toward the end was intended as a political dig. Boolie tells Daisy that his wife, Florine, is away at a function as a Republican delegate. Indeed, the South was beginning to change.

While the the aspect of examining an unlikely friendship over a significant period of time is interesting and tender at times, it also reeks of Oscar bait. Still, the performances were excellent. Jessica Tandy does a great job portraying a self-described liberal who isn't prejudiced, and Morgan Freeman does the best he can with his seriously patronizing chauffeur character. I'd say that the major problems with the film lie with its source material than with anything else. While the film can get away with a certain amount due to it being a period piece (covering 1948-1973), it glosses over the racial material a little too much and invoking Martin Luther King Jr seemed like pandering. That being said, the film's primary concern is the development of the central friendship, and it does well in that respect. It is rather sweet to see the relationship develop and progress from thinly veiled contempt to genuine caring (on Miss Daisy's part). Other elements of the film are also worth mentioning, such as the score by Hans Zimmer. As someone more familiar with his work on Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, this was quite interesting and unlike anything else I've heard from him. Some of the synth work was a little too 80's but was still pleasant to listen to. The cinematography and makeup were also well done, and might have had more to do with why this did so well at the Academy Awards then with the actual subject matter (not to discount Jessica Tandy's performance, though). Overall, DRIVING MISS DAISY is a perfectly decent, if unspectacular film about a friendship. It's just a shame that it didn't do more to buck certain cinematic stereotypes.

He is playing an old man in this movie and that was 26 years ago (from the time of this review)! Anyway, Driving Miss Daisy is a film centering on the relationship between an aging Jewish lady, played by Jessica Tandy, and her black driver, played by Morgan Freeman, appointed to her against her will when she can no longer drive herself.The movie is supposed to cover 25 years and the movie tries to be subtle about its time progression. It uses ways like the change of cars and makeup, and sometimes also spells out the year on a particular item, like a trophy. While this is an intelligent and praiseworthy attempt, it ultimately fails because Morgan Freeman does not look any older as the movie progresses and Jessica only looks older towards the 2nd half. You have to pay attention to the little things know where you are.That is just a minor complaint but it brings us to a larger one not much is going on in this movie in the 25 years it supposedly takes. Now, before the millions of you come yelling at me that this is not some action movie, I am well aware of that.Obviously, this movie is about the relationship between the two main characters, so the story is not as important, but there is a strange stagnation in both the relationship and the story surrounding it. In fact, Freeman's character actually says so out loud towards the end of the film. The chauffeur always stays outside of anywhere they drive to and these two people do not experience much together. They end at friendlier terms than the ones at which they started, but that is about it.Yes, it is commendable that the movie did not go the romantic way. It could have been easy for it to go the cheap way and show the two main characters fall obviously in love and it is good that the movie avoids this, as well as puts mental barriers in the path of their relationship, but again, in supposedly 25 years very little change shows in the behavior between these two or their situation (apart from getting weaker from age). The movie really is about driving Miss Daisy and is perhaps a little too subtle for its own good.Now, having said that, Morgan Freeman is awesome as the old southern black man. The acting and his accent are fun and his ability to portray this character with realism is praiseworthy. Jessica Tandy is also quite a brilliant actress considering how well she portrayed aging. The difference between her manner at the beginning of the movie and at the end is quite staggering. Their relationship together is interesting and has believability.The is realism overall is high. I do not know the exact nature of conversations and relationships from the period covered, but besides having some anti-racist undertones in its story (probably to try and offset the potential offense of the main premise), the movie is surprisingly raw when it comes to showing the people and their feelings. Freeman's character is polite but he still has his dignity and his own opinions. Tandy's character, although wants to be seen as progressive, is still an old lady with her own special ways.Driving Miss Daisy is a good well-acted film that can be taken seriously and leaves you with a good feeling, but one could desire that a little bit more happens with the relationships and events. At this point I cannot find a reason to watch this movie a second time.

Miss Daisy (Jessica Tandy) is a buttoned-down, prim and proper, emotionally stifled elderly Jewish woman, living in the south. When her son Boolie, (Dan Akroyd) fears that his mother is no longer capable of driving herself, he hires Hoke, (Morgan Freeman) a middle-aged African American, as her driver. The movie centers on the sometimes contentious, funny and poignant relationship between Miss Daisy and Hoke, with the discrimination of the south used as a backdrop.Jessica Tandy is superb in this role. She brings depth and realism to Miss Daisy, and plays her idiosyncrasies well, without turning her into a caricature. She is both victim to her past and advancing years, and victimizer of those around her. Anyone with an aging parent will relate to the difficult, yet fragile Miss Daisy.Morgan Freeman is outstanding as the long suffering and ever-patient Hoke. Cheerful, always positive and with a down-to-earth, commonsense approach, he endears himself to Miss Daisy ever so slowly and carefully. Even while suffering the insults of racism, he maintains his composure and while injured by the slights, doesn't let them define who he is. In addition to the two main characters, Dan Akroyd does an outstanding job as Boolie, the frustrated yet loving son, barely capable of juggling the demands of dealing with both a high maintenance mother and his equally high maintenance wife Florine, skillfully played by Patti LuPone.A special treat is the performance of Esther Rolle as Idella, the no-nonsense, say-it-like-it-is housekeeper, who has learned to accept her role in the household of Miss Daisy, without it affecting her.You will be charmed by the cast, and equally charmed by the story.

And the film does work much better as a study of grudging friendship in the face of the indignities of age, than as a social comment about racism. But there's something about the burnished glow the film gives the waning days of Jim Crow that, in retrospect, also gives me the willies. I wonder how different the film would be if just once they drove by a black kid getting beat up by a bunch of rednecks. Here, the worst evil on screen are two mean cops who call Freeman 'boy'.

Don't misquote me, I am a huge fan of films with profound moral messages, however what made this film stand out was the subtlety of its message.Referring to the opening line, yes, this film was simple. However, it represented simplicity in its best form confident, unashamed and beaming. On the face of it, the story isn't complicated two characters representing different ends of racial divide, discovering that in fact they aren't as different as they may have previously thought. Obviously, key themes are addressed through the story prejudice being a key one, along with trust, friendship and the value of independence. However, these themes are given a three dimensional presentation through the context in which they are presented.Daisy Werthan (Jessica Tandy) is an elderly Georgian woman stubborn, proud and 'unprejudiced'. After crashing her car into her neighbour's garden, her high-flying business owning son (Dan Aykroyd) insists he sources her a driver. Initially she refuses the services of Hoke Colburn (Morgan Freeman) in an attempt to maintain her independence. However, through Hoke's persistent charm and good nature, she slowly finds herself growing closer to her coloured chauffeur. The film then portrays their unique relationship over a period of 20 years, in the context of the social and political prejudices and changes of the period.The genius of this film is the way a, critically speaking, 'small' story can succeed in portraying such a grandiose perspective on life. In this film you will not find an extensive cast, a variety of locations, expensive embellishments or any over-dramatic acting. Instead you will find two characters, explored effectively through successful characterisation who you are able to feel close to. In many ways, what this film shows is that what makes a memorable movie is the quality of its acting, the honesty and integrity of its story and the messages it envelopes.Whats more, this film does not stop with evaluating the rewards of developing an unprejudiced outlook, but it puts into context the rewards of exploiting life of all its riches the things that really matter. Presenting life's twists and turns through charming humour, emotion and self- discovery. The characters are able to meet in the middle, reaching a place where they can both thrive in their new found friendship, without it being over saturated in all the classic clichÃ©s in the book.Overall this quirky drama encompasses all the ingredients of a classic story, whilst making reference to the events of the time. It successfully addresses probing questions, whilst retaining its informality through humour. Simplicity is harnessed to evoke beauty, which is used to illuminate the surprises, discoveries and meanings of life itself.80/100 "},{"Title":"Predictable Yet Touching","Date":"11 January 2010","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" Driving Miss Daisy is a touching film with two very different characters coming together to make for a fascinating relationship.

Her son believes that she needs extra help with her errands, so as opposed to having his mother, Miss Daisy walk everywhere to run her errands, then her son (Dan Aykroyd) takes it upon himself to hire Miss Daisy, (his mother), a chauffeur (Morgan Freeman). At first, Miss Daisy doesn't like the idea of being driven around town because she feels that that is being boastful, proud and snobbish. Ironically, Miss Daisy is somewhat of a snob, in her own way, but not purposefully. She's set in her ways, a true traditionalist, who refuses to become progressive. at all costs. While wealthy, she doesn't want to appear as pretentious or ostentatious because after all, she was just a poor farm girl as she puts it in the film; hence, her reasons for refusing to hire a chauffeur; although, ironically, she does have a maid, who is one of her best friends. At first, Miss Daisy is extremely hateful and rude to her chauffeur, (Morgan Freeman), but realizes that he's only doing his job to the best of his abilities and as the times change, so does Miss Daisy's attitude toward her driver.

Her Christmas gift to him, although, she doesn't celebrate Christmas because she doesn't celebrate it, the reason being that she's Jewish, offers him a token of her appreciation and gives him a practice workbook, in order, that he can learn to read and write. Mr. Freeman plays the character in a dignifed manner--not feeling pity for himself because his character is illiterate, but remains friendly, well-mannered and humble. Not once in the film does Morgan Freeman's character allow himself to feel pity for himself. He's a true character, who's humble, well-mannered and most importantly, respectful. Eventually, Miss Daisy travels to the deep south to visit a relative. Eventually, Miss Daisy and her chauffeur (Morgan Freeman) stop on the side of the ride to eat lunch. When they're approached and confronted by a racist and obnoxious police officer, who wishes to see Miss Daisy's chauffeur's proof of ownership and insurance. Miss Daisy's chauffeur politely honors his request and shows him the proof that it's Miss Daisy's car. Secure in knowing that the car is not stolen because that is what is implied by the officer's reasons for harassing Miss Daisy and her driver, then the officer leaves and Miss Daisy's driver and her are soon on their way. Miss Daisy not being an ignorant fool, knows the real reason that they were being confronted by this obnoxious and evil police officer and it was because she is Jewish and her driver is of African-American descent. Of course, being the sophisticated and dignified person that Miss Daisy is along with her driver, they do not choose to acknowledge this overt example of racism. Unfortunately, this was the era, in which, the Jim Crow Laws were still in effect, hence the reasons for this particular event taking place because it was historically-based on over racism taking place in the deep south; especially, during the 50's and 60's. but I digress. Eventually, Miss Daisy begins to treat her chauffeur (Morgan Freeman) with more respect. Secretly she likes him as a friend, but for some reason, she doesn't want him to know that she cares for him as a friend. It's most likely because she's extremely conservative and probably not one to wear her heart on her sleeve. However, be that as it may, Miss Daisy likes her driver, but throughout the film she is somewhat stern and hateful to him, which grates on your nerves because you think to yourself, Is she ever going to be nice to him? In her own way, she allows herself to become more emotionally-attached to her driver in a platonic, inoocent, friendly sense, which makes this film a gem. Ultimately, I highly recommend this film to anyone over 13 due to the racial slurs involved in this film (in that one particular scene with the police officer), who wishes to see a heart-warming story about an elderly woman, set in her ways, but willing to overcome her own biases and realizes that one of her best-friends she could ever have is her driver.

I avoided this movie for a lot of years, since I always felt Born on The Fourth of July got robbed by this movie, and especially Tom Cruise's unforgettable portrayal of Ron Kovic. No. Morgan Freeman didn't win best actor, but this did win best picture, so I was a bit bitter. Well, I finally saw it, and I can honestly say it put a big smile on my face. It's a really good movie, filled with wonderful, picturesque scenery, and fantastic performances. I enjoyed it very much, but I still stand by my original opinion, that Born on The Fourth of July was better. Jessica Tandy's character is very cantankerous and abrasive in the first half, and it took me quite a while to warm up to her stubborn character, but once she mellowed out in the second half, she became a pure joy to watch. Her chemistry with Morgan Freeman is absolutely delightful. Jessica Tandy was not quite Oscar worthy, but she was splendid in her role, despite her abrasive nature in the first half. It's a memorable performance. Morgan Freeman is just as good as Tandy. He has the southern accent down pat, and I was very impressed by it. Freeman's By golly routine had the potential to get tiring on one's nerves, but Freeman is so likable, he managed to pull it off with perfection. Not many are as talented as Morgan Freeman. Watching her and Tandy's relationship evolve from not caring for one another, to admiration was enjoyable to witness. Dan Aykroyd is surprisingly quite effective in his straight role as the son. I've always been rather tepid towards him, but he did very well here. The finale is alternately sad and heart warming. I went to bed with a smile on my face, and I felt a bit better for not avoiding it any more. I still don't feel this movie is in the league of Born on The Fourth of July, but it's a great film in its own right. It provides a good message about how the changes in race was commencing. 8.3/10 "},{"Title":"Nice film about friendship but not my favorite","Date":"29 June 2013","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" I just finished to watch on Netflix the Oscar winner for best picture driving Miss.

"},{"Title":"Within its own simplicity, Driving Miss Daisy is close to perfect ...","Date":"22 August 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" Adapted from Alfred Uhry's play that fictionalized his childhood memories in the South, Driving Miss Daisy is the inspiring tale of an unusual friendship between an old Jewish lady and his African American chauffeur. Said like this, the film sounds predictable, whether it's for the interracial friendship or the old and grouchy befriending the gay and jovial, but the two characters here are beyond stereotypes. Jessica Tandy, in a virtuoso performance, is Daisy Werthan, an old seventy- something Jewish widow who considers herself a liberal, strong-willed and independent. Morgan Freeman is Hoke Colbrun, slightly younger but old enough to need a job in the post- war Atlanta, he's handy, good-natured, and hides behind his cheerful nature an admirable aptitude to find the right words.The film opens when Miss Daisy accidentally wrecks her automobile and Boolie, her son, played by Dan Ayrkryod suggests she gets a chauffeur because no insurance would cover her. Coincidentally, he meets Hoke, a retired chauffeur after the death of his boss, a local judge. Instead of accompanying the widow, Hoke prefers to stay in the area. Daisy needs a chauffeur but doesn't want one, Hoke needs a job and gets it, only as Boolie's salaried; he still has to convince Miss Daisy to accept him. Then what goes between the two characters is subtler than the typical pre-friendship animosity.Miss Daisy is not prejudiced against Hoke because he's African American, we understand that from her close relationship with her housemaid Idella (Esther Rolle). In fact, Miss Daisy is only reluctant to have a chauffeur because it would mislead people about both her age and her wealth; she's seriously concerned about social perception. And Hoke is a practical man, he understands that sooner or later, Miss Daisy will have to go shopping, and when the opportunity happens, he follows her with the shining new Hudson car offered by the insurance it would be a shame not to use such a good car for abstract reasons. Then she gets in and the relationship can start on good wheels.The scene is crucial because rather than a class or a racial antagonism between two people, it's mainly a difference of thinking that opposes them. Miss Daisy is not a grumpy old Lady, she's a classy retired schoolteacher who believes in some good conduct in life, 'you should be ashamed' is her defensive catchphrase, slightly betraying a life driven by social codes. Hoke is wise enough to never go too far, always respectful and understanding, he makes Miss Daisy believe she's right and make HIS point at the same time. Complimenting a bad-tempered person about her strong personality is a great way to indirectly point out how childish she can get. Hoke knows how to deal with Miss Daisy, contrarily to Boolie, who goes frontal and always loses. And if Dan Aykroyd is remarkable as the well-intentioned and responsible son, the masterstrokes of acting belong to the two leads. Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy, both Oscar-nominated, are so authentic that we never feel it's two actors playing, their interactions, their silences, their verbal exchanges speak more than anything in the film. Indeed, despite all the efforts from the director, the make-up artist, the art designer to suggest the passing of time, this is an actors' film and all we need is to live and endure the slow but powerful growth of complicity between Hoke and Miss Daisy. And each mimic, each reaction is an event by itself, a smile from Miss Daisy, her trial to help Hoke to read or finally, Hoke strongly assessing his right not to behave like a child who has to ask for permission to empty his bladder, one of the film's most powerful moments. Driving Miss Daisy is like a long, but never too slow and never too quiet, travel on a road between two hearts, the direction is only the coming to realization that there's more than a professional bond between them. It takes times to realize that, but life itself is a time-taking process. And through the beautiful friendship, the film also speaks some powerful statements about discrimination. Jessica Tandy seems like playing the same character but when you get deeper in her performance, you realize that she evolves too. She starts as a lady stuck in a world of abstractions, incapable of realizing that two cops in the South despise her as much as they do for Hoke, that the line between Ku Klux Klan's actions and synagogues burning is very thin. And in an extraordinary moment, when she's driven to a Martin Luther King's meeting and decides to invite Hoke just because Boolie couldn't go with her for business reasons, Hoke understands it's a last-minute move and his reaction says it all things might have changed in Daisy's mind, but she's still incapable to level with him. It's those subtle and powerful scenes that make a film like Driving Miss Daisy infinitely superior to emotional stuff such as last year's The Help, a movie I start to regard less excitedly. Because Driving Miss Daisy is a gem, it's one of these cinematic oddities that undermine the existence of particular rules when it comes to cinematic awards, public recognition and even personal enjoyment. The film strikes by its simplicity, a minimal casting, an unfamiliar quietness and the quasi-absence of a plot, yet the effect of its climactic declaration, on the heart is impossible to describe. And if cinematically speaking, the film does deliver what it intends to, although it doesn't feature all the requirements of many successful films, no thrilling sequences, no grandiose speeches, no breakdowns, within its own simplicity, the film is close to perfect. Maybe it deserved to win the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1990, after all. And I say 'maybe' because I still would have to give it a thought had not Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing been so snubbed.

In the fleeting conversation of any chauffeur, taxi driver or leading guardian with his or her passenger in the classically domineering tone of which Jessica Tandy's character has supposedly trademarked.I was naturally reluctant to pick this movie out of the possible thousands of well-known 'classic's I have not had the fortune to behold &#x96; and thereafter judge or scrutinise following the seemingly over-hyped reminiscence of it, left by the ardent and passionate fans of such work; But now after watching it, to me its come to light that this film is much more than the pretentious banter of an upper-class woman to which her abiding driver must hear.Set in Atlanta, Georgia in 1948, 72-year-old Jewish Widow, and proudly self-dependant Daisy Werthan lives alone in her well-kept house - with only her reliant housemaid Idella. Being her age, as much as she would deny, her senses just don't serve her as well as they once did. Prior to this realisation, she unfortunately drives her Chrysler in the wrong gear and subsequently over a ledge, rendering it totalled.Her dependable son Boolie (Played by Dan Aykroyd) is well aware that no insurance company would insure her, and so much his prediction served correctly. He therefore proposes that he should hire a chauffeur for his mother to go about her daily errands and social visits. Of course - and soon understandably - she is reluctant of this, from fear of being perceived as either too old to drive or so wealthy so that she is able to publicly flaunt it with a chauffeur.Despite her obvious dissent, Boolie goes ahead and hires an elder Hoke Colburn (Morgan Freeman) to carry out the task of driving his mother. Mrs. Daisy is adamant on walking wherever she may need to go, but Hokes' kind-hearted and gentlemanly approach persuades Mrs. Daisy to allow him to do what he is being kindly paid to do.So entails a heart-warming tale of companionship between two withering veterans beckons, well-addressed and easily related-to sense of nostalgia over change and the woes of growing old, Hoke and Mrs. Daisy discover the true consequence of time and the importance of family, friendship and holding on to what you have before it is gone.Along with in excellent story by Alfred Uhry and a tremendous score by the one and only Hans Zimmer, comes this timeless tale of which any true film fanatic should play audience to at least once; if not just for the sake of being able to understand the references to which anyone will have undoubtedly encountered.

Hoke is what author Donald Bogle would call a mammie. He essentially subjugates his own identity to that of the white matriarch, takes care of her, and is utterly desexualized. The thing about this heartwarming tale is that unity comes with HER deciding that black people are OK after all, not with any positive, forward moving action that Hoke takes. He just continues being the magical, shaman type of mammie that accepts his position of subservience and continues on cheerfully. I am not saying that her character is deplorable. Latent racism was obviously (and still is) ever present, and she was socialized into that type of outlook by her surroundings. But this movie would have us accept the notion that this type of societal arrangement is somehow worthy of nostalgia. Hoke, and his counterparts in real life, undoubtedly did not enjoy second-class citizenship. They abhorred it. It is interesting that this film came out the same year as Do the Right Thing. That film is an honest, poetic, symbolic portrait of race relations. Driving Miss Daisy is a film designed to make the abuse of African Americans in this country more palatable to white people.

It's not just that it's a bad film, because there are plenty of bad movies that are overrated for perfectly understandable reasons. But there's very little to grab onto here. It's a dull movie, with the drama and comedy being equally half-hearted, leaving us just watching a pleasant but not particularly interesting series of events. The direction is inept, and the performances are solid (excepting Dan Ackroyd's terrible southern accent) but don't have much to work with. The critical and commercial success of the film and the play it's based on would then seem to be a mountainous testament to America's willingness to hear a racial fairy tale.Morgan Freeman, as Hoke Colburn, represents the kind of racial integration everyone can get behind. He's an old, cuddly black man whose rebellion against racism is never fiercer than an angry mutter under the breast and is usually the picture of folksy wisdom and compliance. What's more, the film gallingly presents the struggle for equality as Hoke's struggle to serve Daisy, and her acceptance of his service to her as an overcoming of prejudice. By this logic the antebellum south was a hotbed of anti-racism. It is, however, very comforting to the white movie-goer, who can now beam at their own acceptance as they take their popcorn from the black woman working for minimum wage behind the counter.Driving Miss Daisy meanders from one year to the next, stopping on plots briefly and occasionally finding affecting material but never really having the focus to explore it. The makeup is perhaps the only thing done well here, ageing its characters two decades in a way that seems absolutely natural. In the end, while Driving Miss Daisy was only made in 1989, I've seen films from 1929 that seem fresher and less dated. The sepia-toned nursing-home cinematography accounts for a lot of that, but I'd like to imagine that its glib presentation of race is also part of why it seems so jarring to a contemporary viewer. On the other hand, The Help did pretty well for itself at the awards as well, so maybe that's wishful thinking.

History has shown that there's an incredibly wide range of pictures to get the honor and no real formula. Still, I tend to think that all the best pictures have a boldness in vision which includes a certain thematic gravity. I feel like Driving Miss Daisy brushes on ageism and interracial themes but at too much of a distance to feel like a profound statement has been made. I am pretty sure that in this decade's Oscar-oriented November and December templates, Driving Miss Daisy would never have stood a chance at a nomination. It would be considered a pleasant character-driven film that would get some good reviews but would get drowned out by more ambitious films. Matchstick Men, Interpreter, The Weatherman, and Secondhand Lions are films that come to mind in this category.

Based on a play, and it should've stayed on the stage despite the freedom film gives to driving, it's really stale and bland. Quite backwards and overly simplistic especially among a field of more progressive films of its time. The quirky 'odd couple' relationship between an old lady and black man provides clichÃ©d conflict and saccharine drama, touching on light racial themes as delicately as possible as to not disturb anyone. It has mildly amusing moments, nothing original in the slightest, just flukes where the charm clicks, though it ruins it with something eye rolling inducing shortly afterwards.It actually wouldn't be quite so bad if the ensemble wasn't so unbearable. I've never found Morgan Freeman this intolerable, from top to bottom he comes off as false and irritating. The only moments he's decent are the somber reflective ones, this tone he later took throughout the better part of his career, but otherwise it falls flat. Jessica Tandy is no help to him either being merely okay and Dan Akroyd always looks and feels out of place, one take away from anything natural. It has a clunky contrived rhythm about it that doesn't make anything believable. It's just a sentimental lifetime movie with no real justification of why we have to spend it with these insufferable characters. There's a reason Bruce Beresford wasn't nominated for Director or done anything worthwhile since, he has no vision, if only they realized it for the Picture lineup too. I'm just glad to have gotten it out of the way.5/10 "},{"Title":"Was Right to Avoid for 25+ Years","Date":"2 June 2013","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" Best picture??? Bad choice; shouldn't even have been nominated. How about My Left Foot, Field of Dreams, Glory? This so called relationship film is Tandy's being ultra-cranky and Freeman shucking and saying, Yes'm. This goes on for decades!!!! The viewer gets more out of Freeman and Akroyd's relationship. Further, the movie skips through time like a rock skipping across water. Never staying long enough for us to grow along with the relationship. Only once, when Freeman confronts Tandy about having to go to the bathroom is their an actual face-to-face discussion of an issue and even then we are then whisked off with out any satisfaction of resolution. The soundtrack will kill you too, very dated. Zimmer at his worst.

That film was the masterpiece of Spike Lee's career, a little joint called `Do The Right Thing' which remains mired in controversy but critically acclaimed.  Indeed, Roger Ebert continues to stand by it as the best film of the year.  The biggest robbery of Academy Award history aside from neglecting `Raging Bull' in 1980 was not even nominating `Do The Right Thing' and instead awarding the far less superior `Driving Miss Daisy.'Possible SpoilersAfter years of putting it off due to anger over the lack of appreciation for `Do The Right Thing,' I made the journey to my local Blockbuster and got up the nerve to rent `Driving Miss Daisy.'  I'm even angrier now.  What we have here is a very blatant case of Oscar panelists purposefully choosing a movie that barely scratches the surface of the racial divide without having to take the extra leap that comes with awarding the more truthful albeit forceful Civil Rights gem `Do The Right Thing.' The fact is that `Driving Miss Daisy' was shallow and every tension about race and religion was left under the surface.  There seems to be some promise when Hoke (Morgan Freeman) tells Daisy (Jessica Tandy) that her Jewish synagogue was bombed but Hoke never stands up for Daisy's religious beliefs by asserting how evil that event was and it seems to be spoken of only in passing. Similarly, Daisy gets tickets to witness the preaching of Martin Luther King Jr. and invites Hoke at the last minute.  I had the feeling that this episode had more to do with her desire for a bond with Hoke than her support for the Civil Rights Movement.  Her son Boolie seems to agree with this premise when he questions Daisy's sudden interest in King's message.  The episode seems tacked on as a way of giving viewers a timeline for the film and pretending to provide some depth for the very simple story.  The scene in the graveyard where the truth about Hoke's illiteracy is revealed was excellent and an entire film could have been created from it, but `Driving Miss Daisy' continues after this scene without so much as an afterthought to the latest developments in Hoke's quest to read.  I know that the other viewers of `Driving Miss Daisy' will discredit most of what I've said with the idea that films should be subtle, and I concur with this notion.  Films like `Driving Miss Daisy' are purely delightful when compared with loud bombs and pathetic love stories in `Pearl Harbor' and terrible sound editing in `Armageddon.'  But an Oscar-winning film should be original and provocative.  It should have more depth than the other films released in that year.  It should contain a message that is new and refreshing.  `Driving Miss Daisy' contains nothing we haven't seen before and is not daring.  Along with `Do The Right Thing,' the nominated film `My Left Foot' contained the formula for an Academy Award and it was wonderful to watch as Christy (Daniel Day-Lewis) learned to master painting with his feet.  And yet for some reason, the Academy embraced `Driving Miss Daisy.'      If there is any reason to see `Driving Miss Daisy' it is the performances.  Jessica Tandy was truly deserving of the Academy Award as Daisy and I thoroughly enjoyed her fits and initial lack of acceptance of Hoke.  I was also impressed with Morgan Freeman, though I got very tired of watching as Daisy and Hoke shared an important conversation like Hoke, your my best friend, and his only response was Yes'm.  The finale in the retirement home was touching and capped off what I felt was a good but forgettable little film.  The film is surely one of the better of 1989 but it's not memorable and certainly not moving enough for Oscar.7/10    "},{"Title":"Not awful but not good","Date":"7 October 2003","Score":"5 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":"  Is Driving Miss Daisy a terrible movie? Nope. Is it the worst movie ever to win the Best Picture Oscar? Well yes, I'm afraid so, at least out of those that I've seen (pretty much all from 1980 onwards and a dozen or so from before that). The acting isn't especially bad but nor is it anything to write home about. The problem is that the characters are basically a bit one dimensional for us to see anything exciting Jessica Tandy does irascible for half the movie and then irascible with a heart of gold for the second half, Dan Ackroyd pretty much does exasperated the whole time and Morgan Freeman is mostly reduced to saying `yes suh` to whatever anyone says to him (which is, needless to say, a huge waste of his talents) And the story...well there's nothing wrong with `They don't get on and then they do` type stories but they aren't exactly original and they'd had to be pretty special to be worth a best pic win. This one isn't. It's no-where near being a contender for any 'worst movie' lists but if it hadn't won the big one it'd probably just have disappeared into obscurity with all the other mediocre movies, which to be honest is pretty much where it belongs "},{"Title":"Fail as a film.","Date":"5 November 2013","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" I don't understand what is the appeal of this film. It has nothing to offer besides the excellent performance from Mr Freeman.This film it's very dread and devoid of a decent content,to be honest. Decent story? No. It has a lot of racist content in there,for sure. I just don't get it if the intention of the film was to pass a message con-racism or pro-racism. Or even neuter about the subject. Strange. And the main history itself is fail. It simply fails. It fails in reach it's objective, that is to tie the viewer into the growth of a relationship between the chauffeur and the rich old woman. The 'affective' side is poorly delivered, since that is almost impossible to understand the characters. This happened due to a not well build 'conflict' act. The Soundtrack is very annoying as well.

Yet as soon as I could make myself composed, I did enjoy every minute of the film. Jessica Tandy (an unusual late bloomer) won BEST ACTRESS in the Oscar race and set the record to become the oldest actor to win among all four acting categories, which is still unbreakable to date. Her performance is combined with subtlety and accuracy, and plunged herself to incarnate her role, a vivid recreation yet not over-the-top. As for Morgan Freeman, I guess it's rather difficult to see him in his younger time, given that the film was made 22 years before, he carried the same contour in The SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (2004), SE7EN (1995) and even MILLION DOLLAR BABY (2004), the only distinction was the more rapid and fluent speed of speech. I think this has been his best performance so far (I haven't seen INVICTUS (2009) and STREET SMART (1987) yet). The duel tension between two protagonists contrives a wonderful nuance towards the spectators. I feel a bit puzzled towards Dan Aykroyd's nomination (BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR), for me his performance is just okay, compared with Jessica and Morgan, his ornamental screen time never own any moment memorable.The film is a pleasant prose, shines with the charm of true friendship beyond races, the final scene renders the warmest moment of mutual understanding and love between two human being.

'Why' isn't mysterious. Its plodding plot line confirms what I bet most African Americans suspect is their propositional status with Jews We're all in this together as long as you dusky folk know your place. Finally, we have PC-certified condescension. Breakthrough.It's all about the 'relationship' between Miss Daisy of the title and her black chauffeur Holk - except its key points generally are tipped by incursions of that ol' debbil racism and what modern-day Northern Jews determine is virulent anti-Semitism that's always infested the South like a boll weevil in a cotton ball. That there's only subjective 'evidence' of this is minor detail. In one turning point, Daisy and Hoke find common ground after her synagogue is bombed; that actually happened mid-1950s, but as reaction to its role in Atlanta civil rights protests, not so much hatred of Hebrews. Obviously, tales of victimhood and suffering - fabricated though they are - are much more in sync with today's political ambiance than recalling Jewish role in the Atlantic slave trade, or that the Confederacy's Secretary of State blew the shofar.There's an amusing moment in which their limo is pulled over by two state troopers with oddly subtle approach to their Bull Connor obligation in the movie. They ID Miss Daisy as Jewish but... how? Is there a Mogen David on her license plate? Appearance? I look more Jewish than Jessica Tandy.You owe yourself a pass on this one.

Daisy is stubborn and insists on walking &#150; even when Boolie hires black Hoke Colburn to drive her around. After some time of ignoring Hoke, Daisy finally starts riding in the back of the car and gradually settles into the routine. Despite a very frosty approach from Daisy, Hoke treats her with respect but also honesty. Over their 25 years together the two see many things change in America while their relationship develops past employee/employer.I have not seen this film since 1989 when it came out and was greeted with endless praise in the manner that all these sort of things are (worthy pictures). Watching it now, it must be said that it comes across as overly sentimental and far too glossy and idealistic to really stand up as a political message film or even anything more than a daytime TV semi-weepy. The plot takes huge leaps over the 25 year period it tries to cover and in some regards it doesn't totally manage to convince me of the time passing. The interactions between the two keep it all interesting but, as a piece of symbolism it just doesn't work any deeper than the surface. The sentimental gloss runs right through the film and the only thing that prevents it from being a daytime TV special is the cast.Tandy won an Oscar for her performance and, although I don't buy that, I still thought she was pretty good. She allows herself to be made fun of and cleverly puts her character's prejudices across while still convincing herself that she doesn't have any. Considering her material she does pretty well. Freeman is much better because his performance is right on the wire and it would have been easy for him to slip and ruin it. At times I thought he had lost it and had slipped into a black stereotype that brought Jar-Jar to mind, but he always held it together and give him character to overcome the possible clichÃ© he could have been &#150; not easy to do but Freeman does it.Aykroyd breaks through into straighter material with his performance here and he is good even if he has only a few scenes spread over the film. The rest of the support is good but the film it totally Tandy and Freeman's and they really do it well &#150; managing to lift the material above the sentimental level that it could easily have settled at.Overall this is not a great film and certainly doesn't deserve the fame and reputation that the Oscar glory and the 'worthy' material have given it over time. The sentimental script and plotting is rather superficial and not as deep as it should have been, while the film skims over the years like a flat stone on a lake. Only the strong performances and easy chemistry between Tandy and Freeman saves the film from just being nothing more than a daytime TV soap.  "},{"Title":"Like this film? Watch soap operas.
