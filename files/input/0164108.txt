Brooks has always made movies that are good for a feel-food time, and this is a good example.

He has an interesting and unique way of telling story with humor, wit and sincerity. He is not afraid of appearing to be 'un-hip'. Actually that is the charm of most of his work. He has been compared to Woody Allen but Ithink that his work is much more universal. Woody's giant persona gets in the way of his stories whereas Brooks actually becomes a character. He does notplay himself and does not comment of things. He 'plays' characters like a real actor. The Muse is just as brilliant as Defending Your Life and Across America. Andie MacDowell is good when a good script guides her. Sharon Stone wasmade for the role of the Muse. Her energy is sexy, ditzy as well as forceful.

Less acerbic, but often just as funny as Woody Allen, Brooks looks at the world through a slightly askew, charmingly off beat prism, invariably placing himself in the center of his films as the average Joe persona put-upon by the daily frustrations and absurdities we all face as we struggle to make it though our often harried modern lives.His latest charmer, The Muse, provides even more of a fantasy insider's view of Hollywood than Steve Martin's recent Bowfinger.  Brooks portrays a fairly successful screenwriter who is suddenly experiencing steady rejection of his most recent script as studio after studio turns thumbs down on the project.  Driven by desperation, he enlists the aid of a tempermental Muse, played winningly by Sharon Stone, an actual descendant of Zeus who moves her way around the Hollywood bigwigs, inspiring hit movies as she goes - or so her many devotees think.  Part of the fun of the film comes in the latter portion of the film when doubt is cast on the validity of her credentials, which speaks humorous volumes about the state of mental health in that crazy land known as Hollywood.In fact, the film is at its freshest in scenes in which Brooks gently skewers the crass insensitivity, lack of creativity and general madness of the movie industry itself - and he has enlisted quite a number of major Hollywood big shots to appear in amusing cameo roles that mock their own self-importance and that of the business they are involved in.  Despite the occasional thudding one-liner, Brooks' script floats along much like a muse itself, fluffy, amiable and charming.  The lovely Andie MacDowell, as Brooks' understanding and supportive wife, adds immensely to this air of breezy likability.The Muse, unlike so many modern comedies, manages to captivate and entertain without working itself up into a frenetic frenzy and without breaking into a sweat.  This is a film, rather, to relax into and simply let the author take you where he wants you to go.  The journey, luckily, is a fun one.

That being said, I guess I'm not one of them. I have owned The Muse for about three years, and I usually watch it about once a year, after being reminded of its existence on cable/HBO. I always enjoy it every time I watch it. I think Sharon Stone portrays her character with class and humor; not to mention that she is one of the most stunning women ever to be in motion pictures. While I do think that by the end of this movie, you'll probably have had enough of Albert Brooks' whiney, monotonous voice, some of his lines and sound effects are rather funny. Andie MacDowell is a beautiful woman, and while her characters are never really memorable, I feel she is a good actress, and entertaining to watch in movies.This movie is a light-hearted, film of mindless entertainment.

Brooks plays the screenplay writer and Sharon Stone is the Muse. My first basic instinct was dubious when I found out that Stone would play this character. However, I do have to admit after watching the film that Stone's performance was very inspirational. Brooks' screenplay is enriched with cleverness and insights into the very competitive writers' hollywood. The one story that the narrative could have done without out was the Muse's role to inspire Brook's wife, dolefully played by Andie Mcdowell, to start up a cookie business. It was just one big cookie monster disaster that is not characteristic of Brooks' ingenious writing.

The Muse, his latest creation is a harmless jab at the Hollywood filmmaking industry.  The story is not particularly new or fresh, but it is effective satire in Brooks' inimitable sardonic style.  The comedy mostly works, but sometimes falls flat with excess as Brooks can't seem to judge when a gag becomes too much of a good thing.Brooks plays Steven Phillips, a veteran writer who has lost his edge.  At least that is what he is being told by everyone else.  Upon relating his frustrations to his best friend Jack (Jeff Bridges), Jack confides in him that his career was saved by a muse and promptly offers to set up a meeting with her and Steven.  Enter Sarah Liddle (Sharon Stone), muse extraordinaire, who in return for her inspiration requires lavish and continual attention and has an insatiable appetite for luxuries.Steven becomes her shameless lackey as does his wife (Andie MacDowell) in hopes that she can bring both of them fame and fortune.  Ultimately they discover that she is not actually a muse, but something else entirely.As always, Brooks casts himself in the puling nebbish role, full of self deprecation and sarcastic pokes at everyone and everything.  The movie makes the satirical point that everyone in Hollywood is looking for an edge and will do just about anything to get it.  In typical Albert Brooks style, comedy is used to make an introspective point.  If one looks deeper, the philosophical point is that the edge is a perceptual concept.  If one is affected by the industry's negative opinion of one's work, the loss of confidence will cause him to lose his edge.  This is obvious by the fact that the muse had no real powers, yet she helped every person she met.  The only thing that changed was each individual's belief in the talent they had lost faith in.The story meanders from scene to scene with no real flow and shamelessly throws in dozens of cameos of all Brooks' Hollywood friends.  From a directorial perspective, this film show why it is not a good idea for a writer to direct his own material.  He is too close to it and can't see the little flaws that make the movie choppy.The acting was mixed.  I'm convinced that Albert Brooks is not really acting when he stars in movies he writes.  He is just being Albert Brooks, saying the words he would say if he were in this fantasy situation of his own creation.  While his whimpering style can be funny in minor roles as a foil to some other character, a full feature dominated by his whining gets more than a little tedious.Andie MacDowell never ceases to be fresh in the nice girl role.  She just beams with enthusiasm and vitality as Steven's wife who, inspired by the muse, turns her love of baking into a Hollywood cookie empire.Sharon Stone dominates and energizes the story in her role as the muse.  This is the type of role she plays best, the ultimate femme fatale, a siren of fantasy and desire.  She exudes feminine superiority and gets her way through guile and manipulation.  No one can resist her magic and she makes slaves of them all.I gave this movie a 7/10.  All in all, it was entertaining, with some funny gags and plenty of Albert Brooks ironic jaundice for life.  If you can't get enough of Albert Brooks, you will want to see this movie.

All of Brooks' movies are about him entering a critical transition period of life (or death). Like Allen's films, his variations on this familiar theme range in quality. 'The Muse' is a solid effort. Most Brooks films have funny zingers; this one has a whole filmful plus a clever story to boot, and a big-budget cast. The more you know about Hollywood and the motion picture industry (I recommend 'The Big Picture' by Epstein), the more true-to-life you understand the film to be, and thus the funnier the jokes become.I'm not sure why it did poorly, and reading others' comments yields little insight. All I can say is that Brooks is never a fully sympathetic character--he is always at least partly to blame for his predicament--never quite the aw-shucks underdog. At least this time he and Johnson introduce other characters who are even more sympathetic to generate audience goodwill. Not to mention that the two leading ladies are both stunningly good-looking. Plus the whole Hollywood self-referencing is a lot of fun. Bottom line is, I believe that this is among the best of Albert Brooks' films. It has many winning qualities which permit it to transcend the Brooks formula. It shares a certain affinity with another wry comedy, Being There; both are stories about people being drawn in by the mysterious among us.

He lives in a mansion with his wife, Andie MacDowell, and is going nuts because he won't be able to support his family. A successful writer friend, Jeff Bridges, puts him in touch with a muse, a Greek spirit known for inspiring artists. The muse is Sharon Stone. And she is some work of art. She not only impinges on the lives of Brooks and his family. She takes them over.She has demanding tastes, grows quickly bored with the suite at the Four Seasons that Brooks is paying for. She has a whim of iron, sending Brooks out for Waldorf salad from Spago in the middle of the night. She's friendly towards Brooks' wife and urges her to begin the commercial cookie-making career that she's discarded over the years. MacDowell follows Stone's advice and finds self-fulfillment before the oven.Meanwhile, Brooks is going nuts. He's spending money and time keeping Sharon Stone satisfied but he's getting very little inspiration out of her. An occasional, off-the-cuff suggestion -- that's all. Brooks develops a script based on her hints but reaches a block at the end of Act II, with his protagonist owning an aquarium and nowhere else to go. He presses her abjectly for an idea and she suggests that, since they must use drilling equipment to build the foundation for the aquarium, why not have them strike oil? Right out of The Beverley Hillbillies.In the end, Stone turns out to be not a muse but a multiple personality who has escaped from a private psychiatric hospital in Ohio. Last time out, she was Picasso's daughter. Brooks of course is a neural shambles by now, but -- Lo -- Paramount buys his script and everything is fine -- except that the producer at Paramount turns out to be Sharon Stone in another disguise.There are a lot of cameos in the film, some easily recognizable, others not -- from Wolfgang Puck to Martin Scorsese who does a hilarious turn as himself, planning a remake of Raging Bull, only this time the guy is really THIN. You see it? Can you see it? Scorsese speaks faster than a normal person can think.Overall, it's mildly amusing, and that's about it. Nothing wrong with the professional players. Brooks is the anxiety-ridden middle-class character that he's perfected by now. Sharon Stone is seasoned. Andy MacDowell is beguiling. But the script is full of logical holes. This is okay in a comic fantasy, in itself, but there are so many of them here that they become noticeable. We can contrast The Muse with a comedy like Groundhog Day to illustrate when I mean. In Groundhog Day, with an equally preposterous premise, one thing follows inexorably from what has happened before, so the film DEVELOPS. That sense of inexorability is lacking here. If Stone is really not a muse at all, but just a psychiatric case with an occasional shopworn notion, then what are people like Scorsese and Ian Cameron and Rob Reiner courting her for? And, shortly after she escapes from the doctors who have come to fetch her back to the institution, how does she suddenly show up as a producer at Paramount? It's good for a laugh but nothing has set the situation up, so it's a shallow chuckle rather than the conclusion of any plot thread. It's like A man walks along the street, slips on a banana peel, and falls on his bum. Ha ha, but so what? Another instance When he brings that Waldorf salad back to Stone's suite at night, she's lost interest in it and turns him away. Still holding the big bowl of salad, he backs into another hotel guest and crashes out of sight to the floor. We see the guest's face looking down as he asks, Are you alright? Well, we already KNOW what the gag is going to be. But instead of keeping the camera on the guest's face and hearing only a moan from the floor -- or seeing Brooks' salad-covered head very slowly emerge from the bottom of the screen -- there's a cut to Brooks on his back, decorated with salad. Where was the muse when she was most needed? The best feature of the film is Albert Brooks' performance. He's done it before just about perfectly, and here he does it again. It may be that no one in the history of movies has better expressed astonishment mixed with self-righteous indignation. What a terrific whiner he is.

Take that scene where she sucks on the end of a straw without handling it. She's trying to look adorable, but comes off like a cat keeping an eye out for prey.Stone, so perfect in Basic Instinct and Casino, kills this comedy with her unretractable claws, but it would have been sickly even without her. Albert Brooks co-wrote, directed and starred in this Hollywood satire, a kind of weak sister to Robert Altman's The Player. This one's about a whiny screenwriter (Brooks) whose career is hitting the skids and who needs inspiration which he finds in Sarah Little (Stone), who claims to be a real-life Muse out of Greek mythology. Brooks's friend and fellow screenwriter (Jeff Bridges) swears by her, and so do a number of other Hollywood luminaries who appear as themselves in surprise cameos. But her services come with expensive and eccentric demands, from a $1700-a-day hotel suite to a Waldorf salad at 3 A.M. Worse, she insinuates herself into his family life and inspires his wife (Andie MacDowell) to start up a cookie business.I say worse because this subplot gives us terrible scenes with Stone and MacDowell. Stone cannot convincingly play a nurturing friend to another woman, and MacDowell cannot play comedy. We fancy an unintended subtext the Muse really wants to claw out the wife's eyes; and the wife expresses her disdain by speaking robotically and using exaggerated facial expressions. These two are so bad we almost forget that Brooks is also awful. His performance would be spot-on if he were parodying a whiny Jewish comedian, but he merely is one.Some independent movies have small audiences because they don't pander, while others like The Muse have small audiences because they deserve them. Who cares about this inside-baseball stuff anyway? Leonard Maltin says Brooks's gibes at Hollywood are priceless, but oh how I didn't laugh at how difficult it is to meet with Steven Spielberg, and oh how my sides stayed unsplit by how show-biz types will belittle your humanitarian award. Plenty of Hollywood satires like The Player draw us in and fascinate us. But Brooks's priceless gibes sound like an insider chortling to himself while expecting other insiders to chortle along with him. Meanwhile, outsiders stare blankly at the screen. As for the whimsy, I quote Otis Ferguson on the light touch of fantasy in The Wizard of Oz It weighs like a pound of fruit cake soaking wet. "},{"Title":"The Muse. The Muse.

This film is very insular, and does not cater too well to those outside of the entertainment industry with its scope of Hollywood insider jokes that would only range from the Westside to a mile outside of the L.A. basin.Its premise involves successful screenwriter Steven Phillips (Albert Brooks, who is still able to maintain the same whiny shtick for all these years)slowly losing his edge that everyone around him notices but himself. After whining about it to his agent, his wife, and anyone who would listen, he goes to his fellow Oscar-winning screenwriter friend Jack (Jeff Bridges) for advice. Jack refers him to the services of a Muse (played by Sharon Stone) in order to help him become inspired again. Andie MacDowell plays Brooks's wife in her usual cardboard performance, and the more colorful characters are oddly enough, the supporting actors and the cameos. Josh the studio executive was a slick schmuck and Martin Scorsese's appearance was cool. Hal (Bradley Whitford) as Brooks's agent was nothing more than a token sit-com character, and there was lazy writing in delivering some of the jokes in this film. This is any and every dwindling artist's fantasy that works for a corporation whose purpose is to manufacture creativity.I saw this in the theatres in 1999 and then rented it on video months later on. And oddly enough, the film began to feel more and more dated like cheap wine quickly turning to vinegar. And when I watched this the other night on cable, I couldn't believe that I really dug this when it came out. Even though this film pokes fun of the entertainment industry, it also seems to succumb to it, invisibly presenting itself as a slave to it. The film is not bad, but in no way is it very memorable. The jokes and humor are passable, but once again, it would appeal more to an Angeleno than it would a Texan.

This is an occasionally amusing but generally uninspired and sometimes even dreary film. Its main downfall is that Brooks (as both actor, writer and director), has nothing new to say, and is still relying on the same stale old persona and situations that he used much more effectively back in 1985.There are some saving graces in the film Sharon Stone is excellent in a tricky role, she avoids the easy trap of playing her role for laughs and in light of the revelation about her character at the end, her performance rings true.And the ending - where we learn that Stone isn't a muse but actually a person with mental issues who has been based in a sanitoraium - is an apt comment on the gullibility of Hollywood types who are so distanced from reality that they would actually seriously believe she was a muse. Jeff Bridges is also fine in his small role.Having said that, up until that revelation this is a very toothless satire on Hollywood. Brooks' character is also hard to take. He's doing his usual whiny persona but there's nothing in this film to suggest he has anything to whine about.Also, Andie McDowell fails to make much of an impression with her character. She's not helped by the relationship between her and Brooks being weakly written and not adding up to much.Probably most disappointing is how weak it is as a comedy. As an earlier reviewer noted, the scene where Brooks (as a punchline) ends up with a Waldorf salad all over his face is a very lazy and sitcomish moment that one expected Brooks had the talent to avoid. Another sign that the passion and purpose is ebbing away in his work.Another weak comic moment is towards the end where the Doctor and Nurse visibly crack up when they learn Brooks/MacDowell seriously believed that Stone was a muse. It's another lazy, unrealistic 'sitcom' attempt at humour - it's just not believable that a doctor would behave in such a manner. Something more subtle was required to be effective.While an OK timepasser, in the context of Brooks career trajectory this was a dispiriting disappointment.

As a result, I avoided the film and did not watch until now. I am sad I waited so long.Brooks stars as an aging Hollywood screenwriter without an Oscar to his credit, just a nomination years ago. His current problem (because you have the feeling with any Brooks movie that his character ALWAYS has a problem) is that he cannot get his recent script made. The studio feels he has lost his edge, a phrase that follows him from person to person as he attempts to make since of this tragedy.Brooks visits a friend played by Jeff Bridges who is far more successful than he. Bridges tells him about a woman he sees who inspires his greatest work. The muse, as she is called, is played with great vibrant energy by Sharon Stone. One problem with the muse she has an expensive appetite - and not just for food. The phrase high maintenance brings on all new meaning and each scene is funnier than the next. She needs certain foods in her refrigerator, an expensive bedroom, different paint on the walls, then all new paint over that because it's too bright.Some of this may seem tired and overused. Albert Brooks, though, is a genius when it comes to movies like this. Take, for instance, a scene when Brooks is caught in a conversation with someone who does not speak the best English. This is a ploy we've seen so many times. In an Albert Brooks movie the timing is perfect and the dialog is pierced with humor. I believe it ends up being the single most funny scene in the film.Critics talk about the payoff to a film. The payoff to 'The Muse' is not entirely genuine and does not live up to the rest of the film. This brings it down a little but not near enough to make the film a retread of other films. It is never boring or overdone or even underdone. Ignore what you may have heard, give 'The Muse' a chance. It may re-enlighten your interest in the common film. ***1/2 out of **** "},{"Title":"Cute, lightweight comedy with Albert Brooks and Sharon Stone.","Date":"16 July 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Brooks is a moderately successful Hollywood screenwriter, but his scripts recently have lost their edge, according to his agent and others.

He needs help and he asks a very good friend (played by Jeff Bridges) to give him a solution. Sarah, one of 9 muses is the best way to give him inspiration, but she is difficult muse, she has her quirks from time to time and sadly for Steven, her quirks are very expensive... but at least she gives him inspiration. Laura, the wife of Steven gets also inspiration from Sarah. She starts a little cookie -company. The rows between Steven and Laura begin to reach its peak. Then begins the fight for the Muse...This movie wasn't great, but it was worth watching... my opinion is that every movie has something special and this also the case for this one...Certainly the performance of SHARON STONE was wonderful, she is the best muse that I ever saw... I hope she continues to make movies after a stop for 2 years... lets hope that her health is good enough to carry on... ALBERT BROOKS was good as an actor, but sometimes the script didn't please me that much, probably the script that he is writing in the movie is better then the script of the movie. I hope that his upcoming movie with MICHAEL DOUGLAS will be a little bit better. ANDIE MACDOWELL was good to but she doesn't make a lot of movies... but I think it was very difficult to make something remarkable from her personage. JEFF BRIDGES was remarkable too; well he has the talent of his father Lloyd Bridges.SPECIAL THINGS about the movie 1.

Ironically she ends up helping everyone except Brooks and taking complete advantage of him.  Yeah, real funny Brooks, let's see how long you can make that one gimmick work.  The only thing keeping us from hating Stone is that she's a magical being and therefore must know what's best.  At the end it turns out that maybe she was just an escaped mental patient.  We're not really sure.  So the audience is left with this horrible taste in their mouths rather than any shred of laughter that the filmmakers might have been hoping for.

This appears to be the equation that reflects the nature of the beast residing under the infamous Hollywood sign. It is also the equation that ensures a steady flow of that fascinating product you cannot get enough from. We shouldn't question it too often. Let it run this town in doing what it has done best for the last eighty years or so. And if do you question it, do the only sensible thing possible make tremendous fun of it. Robert Altman did just that in The Player; the same goes for Arthur Hiller in Burn Hollywood Burn an Alan Smithee Film. While the former was another multiplot, multicharacter masterpiece that indeed did show the very nature of the beast and the latter too much incrowd tongue-in-cheek to be appreciated by the average viewer, with The Muse Albert Brooks managed to deliver a relatively small but hilarious film that looks at, frowns upon, wonders at and then declares terminally insane the world these characters inhabit. Playing a screenwriter who comes to a point in his career where he has lost his edge and stumbles upon a rather miraculous woman claiming to be a genuine muse, he basically does the thing Ben Stiller is now making buckets of money out of, playing a no-nonsense, do-goody schmuck who does not understand a bit of, but has no choice but to ride the lightning of circumstance. What I found was depicted rather well was the credibility of this insane world an actual muse straight down from the Greek gods providing inspiration to the deprived (but rather wealthy) who, although demanding outrageous conditions, is revered by the elite of the Hollywood industry, because she, well, inspires. You think I'm kidding? Had the makers of Blair Witch Project decided they should make a mockumentary on this, I would have bet good money people all over this town would be begging their agent to get her number. The cast of this movie clearly had a great time doing this one. Apart from the numerous cameos of rather famous directors and actors, I reckon it must indeed have been fun for these people to have a go at their workplace. As previously stated, Brooks is great and there's rather funny supporting roles for Jeff Bridges and Andy MacDowell. What is not supported as always is Sharon Stone's chest, who actually does a great job as the very out-there muse and, although non-nude throughout the movie (welllllll, almost) still doesn't need a bra (or silicones). This is not a brilliant movie, it's not even great, it certainly isn't anything like The Player, but put down a couple of bucks in your videostore and what you'll get is just a plain hilarious comedy, sharp and witty, courtesy of Brooks delivering his own script under his own direction. And if you are wondering about the title of this little review, look out for the party scene shot in Hollywood's most famous restaurant Spago's, during which Brooks' character is trying to explain to someone what it is he does for a living. Promise me that in the unlikely event you totally hate this movie, you will wait for this sequence. It had me rolling off my couch with laughter. The stuff of legend. Or rather, that's what I would have said had I lived under the Hollywood sign.

She has helped such great directors as James Cameron and Marty Scorsese. The Muse is not a movie to watch when you are feeling silly. It is a smart comedy with smart jokes.

Unfortunately, his career is on the skids - unctuous movie execs are telling him he's 'lost his edge' and should try a new line of work. The answer to Phillip's problem is presented by his good friend, a successful writer and producer played by Jeff Bridges.  Bridges informs Brooks that the secret to his success is his muse - in this case an actual muse, a daughter of Zeus, who is living in LA and is named Sarah (Sharon Stone).  Brooks is so desperate for help that he swallows his disbelief at this news and cajoles a meeting with this muse.  'She's demanding' he's warned, and before he knows it he's putting her up in a suite at the Four Seasons hotel and bringing her Waldorf salads in the middle of the night.  In return she promises to 'inspire' him - she won't actually tell him what to write, but when he is with her he will create on his own.From this premise Brooks spins a comedic yarn about the havoc the muse causes on his personal life (she is eventually moved into his guest house and later, his bed), the absurdity of life and work in Hollywood, and the effect Aunty Sarah is having on his family (including 'inspiring' McDowell to be the next Mrs. Fields).  Sarah is a great networker, though - cameos of directors coming to call on her include James Cameron, Martin Scorcese, and Rob Reiner, and when McDowell needs help marketing her cookies, Sarah sets a meeting with Wolfgang Puck, a celebrity chef.Brooks main problem with this film, and with several other ones, is that he dances between absurd slapstick comedy and a more subversive, internal comedy.  Brooks is a comic actor with a skill for understatement, and his Stephen Phillips is capable of showing befuddlement and internal rage at the goings on around him.  But the comedy switches between overt and internal, and the film never seems to develop a rhythm as to which it intends to be.  Woody Allen compartmentalizes his comedy internally - Jim Carrey exhibits it externally.  Brooks shuttles in between.  Say what you want about Adam Sandler, at least you know where you stand with him.Sharon Stone gives a fine performance as the muse - her Sarah is either totally vapid or three steps ahead of the game, and she doesn't give a hint which.  I also enjoyed Brook's eventual explanation of her gift  - it fits very well into his thesis about how Hollywood really works.There are many fine comedic moments in this movie, and I recommend it if you like Brooks and are interested in intelligent comedy.  My favorite is the plot Brooks and Stone eventually concoct for his next script - Jim Carrey inherits a giant aquarium (the zoological kind people pay to get into) from his uncle.  Lots of Ace Ventura type scenes of Carrey ministering to fish.  The aquarium is going bankrupt, but then is saved when they discover oil underneath it.  Everyone in Hollyood is gaga over this script and can't wait to produce it.  And the joke, of course, is that its quite possibly the worst idea for a movie I've ever heard.

Who?","Date":"21 September 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  **Possible Spoilers**		Hollywood takes a hit in `The Muse,' a subtle comedy from co-writer, director and star Albert Brooks.  One week after screenwriter Steven Phillips (Brooks) receives a Humanitarian Award for Lifetime Achievement, he is fired from a three picture deal at Paramount because there are those who feel that he is `losing his edge.'  His agent, Hal (Bradley Whitford), tells him to take a year off, get his edge back.  With a wife and two daughters, however, Steven proclaims this to be an unviable option, whereupon he falls into a funk with no idea of what to do next.  His wife, Laura (Andie MacDowell) urges him to consult with his best friend and fellow screenwriter, Jack Warrick (Jeff Bridges), who has been on a roll for the past couple of years, including one in which he won an Oscar.  After some coaxing, Steven gets Jack to let him in on the secret of his success, and it turns out that he has a muse (a `real' muse), and her name is Sarah Liddle (Sharon Stone).  Incredulous, initially, Steven is finally convinced, and Jack sets up a meeting for him with Sarah.  She agrees to take him on, and he quickly learns that there are rules and obligations that go along with having a muse, which include a suite at the Four Seasons, being on call whenever she feels `inspired,' as well as getting her dry cleaning done and shopping for her.  All at his expense, of course (`Consider it an investment').  And then there's the little matter of explaining it all to Laura (`Muses exist!  They live amongst us!' he tells her).  She responds as expected, but then Brooks cleverly takes the story in another direction.  Laura and Sarah have lunch together, bond, and soon Steven is sharing his muse with his wife. 	Brooks fine-tunes and finesses the humor throughout the film, taking Steven through his paces as he tries to balance out his obligations to Sarah and Laura with the time he needs to actually do some writing.  But the fact that Sarah is supposedly the daughter of Zeus, and that it is taken for granted by all who believe her to be a real muse, is really at the core of the humor in this movie.  Watching intelligent, successful people falling prey to such gullibility enables us to laugh all the more at a situation that is already hilarious on the surface.  Moreover, when you think about it and realize that there are actually those in Hollywood (as well as anywhere, I suspect) who could, in reality, be convinced that such a thing as a `Muse' actually exists, it makes it all that much funnier still; yet if you extend that thought further, it almost becomes scary.  Ultimately, Brooks and co-writer Monica Johnson have turned out a movie that works extremely well on two levels, with the satire on the surface perfectly complimented by all that's going on underneath. 	As usual, Brooks has assembled an excellent supporting cast, including Mark Feuerstein (Josh Martin) and Steven Wright (Stan Spielberg), as well as sprinkling effective cameos by Rob Reiner, James Cameron, Lorenzo Lamas, and Jennifer Tilly (all of whom play themselves), throughout; and there's an especially humorous bit by Martin Scorsese (also playing himself).  The triumph of `The Muse' is that it is thought provoking as well as laugh provoking; you'll laugh, think about it for awhile, and when it really hits you, you'll probably be smiling and chuckling for the rest of the day.  I rate this one 10/10.

The focus of this film is about regaining your passion for life and reconnecting with your creative flow.  Unfortunately, The Muse wasn't a huge commercial success because Brooks' humor is far too sophisticated and subtle for the audience that craves Ace Venture and American Pie.He also uses refreshingly older actors who bring to their roles a complexity that people like Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jim Caviezel can only dream of.

Sorry, not with that car, and with that showcase wife and with that house with a guest house and with those clothes and with the constant use of the term money is not the point lines.  So, by not sympathizing with the main character, I let it go and just enjoyed the gratuitous nude shot of Sharon and the great smile of Andie MacDowell (identical character to hers in Groundhog Day).  The movie could have used a little of Bowfinger's desperation and reality of the cost of things. Glad it only cost me $2.50 at the video store.  "},{"Title":"What a Let-Down!

In fact, it goes nowhere and wastes your time.  It had a good idea, but apparently no inspiration. Albert Brooks is like Woody Allen - he always plays the same character, and it's a boring, whining, one.  Sharon Stone . . . what's the big deal about her?  She's not that good looking, and in this film she is just an annoying princess, whose fabled ability to inspire has to be taken on faith, because it isn't in evidence.  Andy McDowell has lost a lot of weight and has become horrible looking, plus she can't act.  She's only good in roles in which she doesn't have to act anything but sweet.  This was perfect for her.  Give this one a pass. "},{"Title":"An cute movie. Nothing special, but cute.","Date":"10 March 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  I gave this movie a 7 rating - but only barely.

There are great comic moments as he attempts to contact Steven Spielberg.Finally, he consults his friend, played by Jeff Bridges, who puts Brooks in contact with a muse, played wonderfully by Sharon Stone. In fact, this was one the most appealing performances she has ever given.There is witty dialogue throughout this film. At one point, when Brooks is hoping that Stone can work some kind of magic on him, he asks, Are you like Rumplestiltskin, or something? Will I wake up tomorrow and find a script?It is a great follow-up to Brooks' previous movie, Mother, where he played a sci-fi writer with writer's block. I recommend this movie.

He used to be the sharpest satirist around of not only Hollywood sleaze but neurotic self-absorption. Brooks was never afraid to be unlikable in his movies in order to make his comic points. However, in his past three films (Defending Your Life, Mother, and now this) he's backed off from this approach. It seems that now, Albert actually wants to. . . (gulp)... be LIKED. Unfortunately, this doesn't really suit him, and it takes all the teeth out of his work. Albert Brooks trying to be likable (or at least non-offensive) is just, well, dull. And so his films have become increasingly random and unfocused.Still, this is by far the worst of the lot. Added to his fundamental toothlessness, Brooks concocts a story that, while it could have had comic potential, is just ludicrous. The muse character is simply annoying from the get-go, Andie McDowell as the wife has once again been given no role, the celebrity cameos are gratuitos and not particularly well-done none of them seem like they're comfortable being in the picture and want to get out as quickly as possible (the lone exception to this is Martin Scorsese's hilarious appearance explaining his ideas for a Raging Bull sequel - his manic energy is so enjoyable and completely loopy that, in only a couple of minutes of screen time, he steals the picture outright).Most damningly, though, Brooks character is just not one we can get behind - either to like (he's too whiny and flaccid) or even to have fun disliking (we're sympathetic toward him as he's dumped on by the Hollywood establishment). Moreover, the idea for a movie he comes up with under the muse's influence (something about a Jim Carrey comedy taking place in an aquarium ) is such an obvious piece of hack-work, yet presented as such a n epiphany, that we're not really sure if Brooks knows how bad it is. Is this movie a satire about a writer who's lost his talent (Brooks' character in the film), or an unconscious demonstration of the fact (Brooks the man behind this script)? Sadly, I think the latter. Anyone who's loved Brooks in the past will be sorely disappointed by this film, and I can't imagine it making any converts, either. So I guess that covers just about everyone stay away from The Muse.

The premise is absolutely  ludicrous, of course Hollywood artists find inspiration from a 'real-life muse'. But in the hands of a better director, we may have been able to suspend disbelief. We can't because Albert Brooks is too busy peppering the action with what must have seemed to him at the time hilarious cameos (Cameron, Scorsese, etc). They aren't, and meanwhile Brooks has forgotten to direct the actors. Jeff Bridges is ponderous, Andie McDowell lost (seemingly embarrassed) and Sharon Stone a million miles from magical as the muse of the title. The high point, if such a thing exists here, is a conversation of misunderstandings at a party; the very lowest of a lot of lows a running 'gag' involving gifts from Tiffany's.

I kept wanting the Muse to take us to someplace really interesting.  She didn't.   Steven at one point refers to her as The Muse Who Came To Dinner.  That great play used its circumstances to great comic effect.  I wanted the Muse to whip through Steven's life like a hurricane, turning his whole world upside down. That never happened.  The tension never escalated for me.  The Muse and Steven have almost no scenes together after the first half.Sharon Stone didn't work for me.  Why is she a movie star at all?  She's had very few hit films.  She's beautiful, of course, but very cold.  A movie with a woman at the center of the film better have a really good actress or else forget it.  Think about Cameron Diaz in There's Something About Mary or Mira Sorvino in Mighty Aphrodite or the young woman in Chasing Amy. Those women stole every scene they were in, and that was their job. Stone, on the other hand, never really interested me.  I would have preferred Lisa Kudrow as the Muse.  She has the kookie, other worldly personality which would have made her a better choice (Ironically, she played Brook's girlfriend ! in Mother.  She and Stone should have swapped those roles.) The Muse does not necessarily have to be played by someone young (though I'm sure the film's failure to generate much heat at the box office is due, in part, to its lack of youth appeal.)  Heck, even Angela Lansbury as the muse would have been a step in the right direction.The camera work was static and boring. Albert, there IS such a job as directing.  Next time, work with someone who can shape your script and then direct it with some style.  Give your friend Rob Reiner a call.

The Muse is one of these movies. Other than the dark period piece Barton Fink you can not only understand the logic of its story, but also laugh about its witty comments on how screenwriters nowadays try to make their living within the system.  If nothing else, this movie is responsible for me finally respecting James Cameron again who - as Martin Scorsese - is capable of presenting an honest sense of self-irony I never would have expected from him after his Oscar-winning speeches for Titanic.Nevertheless, the real surprise of this movie is the subtlety of its cynicism. Albert Brooks has certainly put a lot of his own frustration into the script being one of the most neglected writer-director of this ending decade.Which might as well has something to do with the fact that his previous films lost the edge his character tries to find by playing the humble servant to a muse who acts like a true Hollywood diva. You may remember that the gods of the ancient world are not as kind as the Christian God. They would certainly asked you for certain favors in return for their advice and support. And why should a modern muse - even if she is just one of various multiple personalities - should stay aside from that practice? The funniest moments of the movie are of course when Brooks alter ego tries desperately to treat his breakthrough inspiration for a bargain - and fails utterly. After paying for her ultra-expensive hotel suite, the insomnia-suffering muse moves soon into his backyard office, forcing him to repaint the walls. In the end she even ends up as the new room mate in his own bed room nearly forcing his wife to camp on the floor to her feet - and certainly demanding that he installs one of these clapping things, because the light is a little far for me. But what is the result of all this effort? Another stupid Hollywood blockbuster comedy might be made just because his muse turns - dea ex machina she is - into his new producing studio partner at the very last minute.This movie is both, bitter and mean -, and Brooks trick is to disguise his attack on the screenwriters adjustment to dull studio managements as a comedy that works simply by inventing Sharon Stone as an astonishingly comical actress.Very rarely I go and see a movie these days which turns out to be better than expected. This is one of these rare examples. Watch out for the new Jim Carrey-comedy about an aquarium which closes because of poisoned dead fishes and reopens as one of the biggest oil-digging companies of California next summer. And if it had been made by Rob Reiner than you know who was responsible for this plot idea.

There is nary a man in this country that can draw a belly wrenching laugh out of me more effectively than this man.  That said, The Muse is Mr. Brooks' weakest effort to date.  Although the razor sharp wit, the self-effacing humor, and the sad sack demeanor were all present and accounted for, the plot was an absolute mess. Much like Woody Allen, it seems that the further Albert Brooks strays from his own neuroses as the definitive central plot point, the more unfocused his films become.  In addition, the less additional characters he tries to develop and weave into the plot, the better. The idea is a pretty simple, and yet quite clever, one.  Brooks plays a successful Hollywood writer whos career is in a heap of trouble.  He seeks advice from a good friend(a totally wasted appearance by the brilliant Jeff Bridges), who hooks him up with a flighty, high maintenance woman(Sharon Stone), who claims to be a genuine, modern-day muse.  She takes him on as her latest case, and proceeds to both aid his writing and complicate his life. As the writer and his new muse first get to know each other, Brooks is at his best, running rampantly is a depressive panic trying to satisfy her every desire.  It seemed clear at that point that the next hour and a half would be composed of watching this sole relationship play itself out(just as Brooks did with Julie Haggerty in Lost in America and with Meryl Streep in Defending Your Life).  No such luck.  It is not long before we are presented with the talentless Andie MacDowell as Brooks' wife.  I swear, this woman has taken over for Penelope Ann Miller as the most unwatchable actress working in film today.  And to compound the matter Brooks writes in an inane subplot which has the muse inspiring the wife to follow her dream of going into the cookie business. And so, instead of Brooks and Stone playing off each other,we are relegated to Andie feigning glee as she reaches wonderful levels of cookie success, as Brooks stays in the background pumping out his new inspired script(a ridiculous story about a guy who inherits an aquarium which is neither inspired nor funny). All in all, I got a bunch of good laughs(especially at Martin Scorsese's cameo), but easily could've waited for video.  I will still await his next effort with baited breath.

Brooks' knack for the hilarious one-liner has not diminished - I found myself laughing my head off, especially in the final 1/3 of the film - but, his story is not nearly enough to sustain the nearly two hour running time.  The performances are all fine, but the picture takes sometime to really take off - with some really silly segues and cameos along the way.  What worked so well about Mother and Defending Your Life was the 'everyman' quality of the characterizations; here, Albert is asking his audience to identify with a character who is spending $10,000 a week to support his creativity!  But, the film does take some funny jabs at the Hollywood community and, despite its silliness, does present some intelligent exchanges between Albert and Andie McDowell, as his wife.Overall, the film is worth seeing - if only because Albert Brooks stands as one of the funniest men in the world.

Now it's Albert Brooks turn, and he does his share with his new film titled THE MUSE. And in his usual style, he too succeeds!  This is a really sarcastic, and smart-alec approach on the business of filmmaking, and nobody but Albert Brooks could have pulled this off. THE MUSE is about Hollywood screenwriter Steven Phillips (Albert Brooks) who is trying to sell his latest screenplay to Paramount Pictures.  The only problem is that the Paramount executive, doesn't like the script.  In fact, no one has really liked Phillips' last few scripts.  According to the studio executives and Phillips own agent, Phillips has lost his edge. So for help, Phillips visits his long-time and successful friend, Jack Warrick (Jeff Bridges).  While visiting Warrick, Phillips sees a beautiful and mysterious woman leaving Warrick's mansion.  Phillips assumes that his friend is having a affair, but Warrick tells Phillips that the woman is actually Sara, (Sharon Stone) who is actually a muse. Since desperate measures calls for desperate acts, Phillips decides to seek help from this muse so he can start selling a script again to a major studio.  There is some problems of course that Phillips runs into.  First, Phillips must convince his wife (Andie MacDowell) that the muse is business relations and nothing else.  Second, Phillips must find time in the Muse's busy schedule to help him out, since almost everyone in Hollywood is stopping by to talk to this mysterous wonder.  And finally, Phillips has to make the Muse happy, otherwise, she'll get angry, and well..... things won't be good for Phillips.  But making the Muse happy, he has to caterer to her needs, and her needs are not cheep.  She wants sleep in a $7,000 a night hotel, the best room of course.  She wants a salad from Spago's in the middle of the night, anda gift everytime he sees her. Brooks take on Hollywood has very very funny results.  Brooks did well taking on other subjects such as television, the after-life, and parents.  But he has never been so great!  I personally think that this is Brooks best movie yet!  Brooks as usual does a funny and great job as his character of the struggling screenwriter.  MacDowell is also good as Brooks wife who at first suspects something is wrong, then also seeks help from the Muse.  And Stone is quite good as the woman that people shower with expensive gifts.  Rarely is there a good Sharon Stone role, I would say that this his her best role since CASINO, and her best work since ANTZ, she is incredible. There are many celebrity cameos in this film, including three of Hollywood's famous directors make a apperance.  Both Rob Reiner and James Cameron make funny apperances, but the best one would have to be no other than Martin Scorsese.  Not only is Scorsese a brilliant mastermind at directing, but he's  very funny as actor.  I just wished that there were more scenes with Scorsese, this film would have been the funniest film since ANALYZE THIS. But that doesn't mean that the film is bad, it's still a great film.  The story is lightweight, but aren't all of Brooks' stories.  But Brooks isn't a masterpiece storyteller, he a observer.  He looks at the way that humans live, and analyzes and pokes fun at them, that is why I enjoyed THE MUSE.   For Brooks' fans, this film is a treat and they will enjoy it.  For intelligent comedy fans (those who liked BOWFINGER and ANALYZE THIS) this is another great comedy for 1999.  However, those who prefer potty humor, or gross jokes that were featured in SOUTH PARK, AUSTIN POWERS, BIG DADDY and AMERICAN PIE, well this sort of comedy requires intelligence, not stupidity or humiliation.  I really enjoyed THE MUSE, it's the intellectual's and thinking person's comedy.  ***** (out of five)  "},{"Title":"Somewhat AMUSING","Date":"28 August 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  I had this movie marked to see many months ago after reading about its' production in a movie publication.

In Brooks' trilogy of comic-horror masterpieces--REAL LIFE (1979), MODERN ROMANCE (1981) and LOST IN AMERICA (1985)--he took his own anguish and humiliation and did a frightful chiropractic on them, breaking them open to birth a never-before-seen form of wince-inducing comedy. The three movies that followed--DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, MOTHER, and now THE MUSE--softened the Brooks protagonist, a grinning solipsist who's deaf to the agonies of everyone around him, into a permanently exasperated schlemiel. I suspect Brooks hasn't lost his edge--he's merely had to file its teeth down to get his work produced. But it's a miscalculation in this era of the Farrelly Brothers and the SOUTH PARK geeks, a comedy that makes the audience unsure whether to laugh or scream would arrive as a revelation. In other words, it would probably make money.This pleasant, uneventful yarn has fewer laughs in its entirety than REAL LIFE has in one reel, but it has one major asset Sharon Stone as the hero's muse, a seemingly real actual deity who sparks inspiration in all those who pay homage to her. This muse has the cranky-baby habits of a spoiled movie star who needs a bigger trailer, and Stone is finally both luminous and lovable. This terrain, where she can both milk her old-Hollywood glamour and deprecate it at the same time, is just where she should be. (Her 1.7-second long nude scene here should make everyone forget about THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR.) As Brooks' wife, Andie MacDowell reveals that she has mellowed into a warm, ripely seductive, accomplished actor. THE MUSE fails as a funny-scary Brooksian CAT-Scan, but it succeeds in demonstrating the ways in which over-forty broads can be really, really hot.

Likewise, Andy McDowell seems miscast as the wife. I think it would have been better if Andy had played the Muse. She does have a more ethereal quality then Stone.

If one starts to watch this movie wanting for sleep, one will quickly find same.The main premise of The Muse is that a slumping Hollywood screenwriter (Albert Brooks, who also directed and co-wrote the screenplay, as per usual for him) turns to a mysterious woman -- a muse (Sharon Stone) -- to help salvage his latest screenplay, not to mention his entire Hollywood career. The idea is that she is going to, somehow, thru some kind of magical and mystical conjuring, turn defeat for the poor sap into victory thru vegetables. With the help of a Waldorf Salad. Or something! Who knows?The biggest problem with The Muse is its ridiculous plot. No, not the fact that he would turn to a muse for help. That's the most believable part of the plot. What is truly unbelevable are the absurd extremes our friendly schmuck will go to in order to get and keep her on his side, so she will help him. Such as buying her a present from Tiffany, before he's even met her, thereby paying to her the initial homage. Such as putting her up in a deluxe $1,700.-a-night suite in the Four Seasons Hotel. Such as agreeing to stock her suite's refrigerator with food -- not from a plain old supermarket, mind you, but from a health food store. Such as agreeing to take her clothes to the cleaners for her (For $1,700. a night in a high-end hotel, wouldn't they have a concierge or somebody to take care of stuff like that?). Such as agreeing to be at her beck and call 24 hours a day -- for ANYTHING! And on and on.Added to all this is the idiot delight's wife (Andie MacDowell). After some initial reservations about her husband's mysterious involvement with a beautiful woman, she eventually decides all these shenanigans between her husband and the lady conjurer are just fine with her. ANYTHING that will help her husband's career. In fact, she, too, avails herself of the services of the female from another mythology to open her own cookie store. Honestly!As hokey and silly as all these goings-on are, one might possibly -- POSSIBLY! -- buy it all (assuming it was on sale for half off at K-Mart!) if Brooks' character was in love with the muse. We all know that people in love do some awfully nutty things for their beloved(s). But he's not even in love with her! He loves his wife! What an outdated and goofy concept for a movie!In the past, I was a big fan of Albert Brooks' films (generally speaking, of course). Just as I once was of Woody Allen's. Just as I once was of Mel Brooks'. Now Mel is way too old to do much of anything, Woody has become a caricature of a caricature of himself, and as for Albert, if The Muse can be used as any kind of guidepost, he seems to either be out of fresh ideas or, if he does come up with one, he can't figure out how to bring it to an entertaining fruition.Ironically, the screenplay in the plot of The Muse might very well have been the real-life screenplay for this movie. Just as Brooks' character had to call on Stone's character in the movie to save his screenplay, it's too bad Brooks had no real-life muse to call on to save his script for this movie.

I'm sure Albert Brooks was clapping himself on the back after he turned this script in to the studio. Trouble is, most of us DON'T make movies. I know, Hollywood, it's tough to comprehend, isn't it?Anyway, Brooks is a struggling screenwriter who's seen better days. The studio is releasing him from his lucrative contract and says he's over the hill and has lost his edge. Luckily, Brooks has best pal Jeff Bridges (not playing himself) to offer him a way out a muse. Now, it's time to suspend your belief...Enter Sharon Stone, playing an elegant, presumptuous, magnanimous dilettante, who offers to 'inspire' Brooks to help him regain that valuable edge. Is she a muse or not? She needs to be put up at the Four Seasons, then their guest house, then their bedroom. She has specific dietary requirements. She's finicky about everything.

The cameos by the real-life filmmakers (like Scorsese trashing the memory of his masterpiece, Raging Bull) aren't so much self-deprecating as belittling - all happily riffing on the apparent theme that there's no longer such a thing as real artistry in the process-obsessed film business, and that inspiration is as marketable a commodity as breast implants. Even in our age though, this notion seems demonstrably false, so it's hard to care very much (as so often with Hollywood-themed movies, the fractured quality of Brooks' own film makes you wonder how sophisticated a hall of mirrors he's constructing the answer seems to be - not very). The exposition in the later stretches is a bit laden down, and most of the more obvious grabs for laughs fall flat - most of the time though Brooks hardly seems to be trying for laughs at all, steering the film into a strange, minimalist zone of repressed, desperate bemusement.

In The Muse we get Mr. Brooks' Steven crashing into a hulking hotel security guard and dropping salad all over his face.

While a bit gimmicky and aimless,it is still quite funny and satisfies in a way he's known for doing(Lost in America,Defending Your Life and Mother spring to mind for me personally).Writer Steven Miller has won what seems to be his umpteenth Humanitarian award for his work in the industry,and being a longtime veteran of penning scripts that get critical acclaim but receive little or no commercial reward,he finds himself at a crossroads for his career. In a moment of personal breakdown in front of his friend Jack(Jeff Bridges,very good in something just a little bit more than a cameo here) recommends that he use the services of a beautiful and spoiled woman named Sarah(Sharon Stone,very fine here),whose exact job is to be a Muse,or inspiration,for artists to do their most successful work. Reluctant at first,Steven takes the Muse in and,after running through hoops for her in ways that seem not worth the effort,his script inspiration takes a commercial(if not quality)turn for the seemingly better. Things complicate when Steven's wife Laura(Andie MacDowall,who rarely seems different in any role she does anymore)ferrets out Sarah,thinking he's husband is having an affair with her. He isn't,and the two become friends,and Sarah's artistic inspiration rubs off on Laura as well.A skewering of the Hollywood industry is served up in the first half of the movie,followed by the last half being somewhat of an actualization story. Uneven? Sure. But the material is kept light enough to please anyone's dry grown-up humor,particularly one who value's Brooks' style. "},{"Title":"AARGH! MY EYES! The most offensive movie for males ever!","Date":"29 October 2004","Score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" This stinker rightly deserves to be in the bottom of the barrel. I have given a rating of 1 only to five movies ever (even Clone Wars doesn't get this honor), movies so repulsively bad your very will to live deteriorates (shallow blockbusters usually get away with at least a 3 or 4). This movie is a 1 if there ever was one.Let's get a few things straight. Barring that I haven't seen too many movies from the good ole 30's, 40's and 50's, this movie is the most sexist movie I have ever seen. If American males had any equipment they wouldn't have anything to do with any women that liked this movie, period! I don't even want to talk about guys who LIKED this movie. The basic premise is that men are incapable and should be treated like dirt, women are powerful and should do whatever the heck they want, norms of human decency aside, and that this is (supposed to be) cute and funny. Blah!Worst of all, the movie is just painfully dull. It is definitely not a guy flick, it is not even a chick flick (by its content it would definitely be a retarded 2-year-old flick). It is not a movie for anyone. Nothing of any significance happens in the movie. Pure boredom.The premise of the movie is simple, to understate it. A hapless scriptwriter struggles to come up with inspiration for a script. Being that he lives in a fairytale, he is talked into hiring a muse. Except, as one tentatively suspects, this muse is more spoiled than one-year-old milk and has expensive tastes, to put it mildly. So the confused and insecure scriptwriter wastes his life savings so that the muse can reside in a luxurious hotel and be properly stocked with crystal and caviar. The muse doesn't really do anything for him; her presence is supposed to inspire him. And just when you think this is segueway into the meat of the story it turns out that the movie never really moves anywhere from that point. Yeah, one more thing, the muse spreads the virus into the head of the writers wife and she gets the idea of emancipating herself from her husband by opening her baking factory (mwahahahaha!). Naturally, she is an instant hit. Oh, but the guy does somehow write his scenario in the end. This movie makes about as much sense as someone's invasion of Iraq.Cheers.Rating 1/10Scale 10 MASTERPIECE, 9 Excellent, 8 Good, 7 OK, 6 Adequate, 5 Average, 4 Mediocre, 3 Poor, 2 Bad, 1 HORRIBLE "}{"Title":"Sharon Stone in Great Comedy","Date":"6 December 2003","Score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  I am not a great fan of Sharon Stone (or Albert Brooks either for that matter).

THE MUSE is a truely great comedy and it is made so by Ms. Stone, not Albert Brooks.  It is also a great thing to see a comedy not based on romance or some other trite concept for comedy.

Played by Albert Brooks, his specific problem that he 'has lost his edge', and is fired because of it. Into his life comes one of the mythic Muses, still alive and very real, to help him get it back.  This is an interesting set-up, and should have made for a better movie than it is.  Sharon Stone's portrayal of the Muse is one of the film's highlights.  But the rest of the cast don't fare as well. Albert Brooks' portrayal of the schlub screenwriter is the same as all his characters, and has done much better in other films. Andie McDowell, as Brooks' wife, doesn't add anything, but doesn't take anything away either.  It's not a bad movie, and it definitely has its moments. But Brooks has done better.

Sharon Stone played a spoiled brat, and did not provide any inspiration to a character 500 other actresses could have played the same way in 500 other movies with spoiled brats. Andie McDowell's character accepted the story of a Muse vs an affair way too quickly with too little proof. I know my wife wouldn't so easily accept another woman, and then let her sleep in my bed too!The dialog was boring, not inspired as some have said of Albert Brooks' abilities, the soundtrack was grating (did not fit the scenes well at all), and the casting less than ideal.

Bridges seems fairly sincere in his role as a journalist whose career nose-dive has been recovered by Stone's influence, while Andie MacDowell plays the neurotic Brooks' savvy wife with assurance, the two coming off as the film's more likable characters.It's an interesting concept and the script is full of smart one-liners in a very hit and miss affair; low key, a sort of inside Hollywood story that's perhaps more for the actors and the audience.

In almost all his movies he has done this, it really be much better than it is. And this time there are only few parts that are *any* good. I've heard that Brooks resents being called Woody Allen of the west (or something like that) - we can understand why. This really is a bad movie.But it would be arrogant to say that Brooks doesn't have the potential to be one of the best in business - the funniest bits are often extremely funny and/or insightful. Can we but hope that we've seen Einstein's biggest blunder already?Is it possible that Brooks doesn't understand what he can do really well, and then what he can't. He should probably get more help from other professionals in writing his movies. And here's one tip (a really important one) The mental sickness his muse is supposed to have multiple personalities disorder is most definitely not what the muse really has. That disease is actually something that you can only get if you've been subject to severe (sexual) violence in your childhood or adolescence. That terrible childhood of the muse is not indicated in any other way in the movie. Then the disease is not even like this - you don't take on parts of just some or the other character, like Zeus' daughter or Napoleon. You take on more abstract roles, each role having its function to protect the person under harsh conditions. Those other personalities are brand new when you make them, not famous historical figures. This is for example the disease Edward Norton's character claims to have in Primal Fear. The muse is more likely to have schizophrenia (multiple personality disorder is often called schizophrenia - especially in the movies - though they are *not* the same). Brooks is not the first screenwriter to mess these things up, but one would wish that (supposedly) smart people with his cocky style should be the ones to get it right - I know Woody would have.
