The story is fairly simple, unpopular guy (Shane West) is in love with hottest girl in the school (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe). His beautiful yet different female friend (Marla Sokoloff) is being adored by the hottest guy in the school (James Franco). So the unpopular guy and the popular guy team up to get the girls. They both help each other in ways that aren't normal to each other. But when the unpopular guy realizes that what he was looking for was right under his nose everything becomes chaotic. The performances are good. Nobody does a stand out job but they all do the best with what they have. The jokes are at times really funny and at times a complete waist of time. There is a lot of racy material for a PG-13 movie. Many of the sexual jokes can get pretty bad. If your a teenager I think you will enjoy this film. Whatever It Takes is a sometime enjoyable and sometime funny teen comedy with a reused plot and many teen comedy cliches. If your looking for a comedy that breaks new ground this just ain't it.

To make this movie, simply feed in keywords like teenager, high school, prom, and booze. Then ensure character choices include two females one rich and self-indulgent, one attractive but rejected. And males Three jocks, three geeks, and a geek-but-jock wannabe. Next, turn the sex setting to extra-super-duper, but make sure the PG-13 button is turned on (or who knows what may happen). InstaScript is conveniently programmed to recognize that audiences love to hate popular people, laugh at geeks watching pornography, and cheer underdogs who get vengeance in the end. So, push print and voila! Out comes a perfectly formatted script that will impress the studio soooo much, they won't notice the missing plot.Instascript will do 'Whatever It Takes' to get your movie made. Note the wardrobe department will save extra dollars with costumes that use minimal fabric to clothe the star females. Notice also the scene where the girl that is willing to have sex with any man who treats her badly (a great portrayal for young female audiences to follow...) is camped on the front lawn of the guy she wants to take to the prom. The convincing way she flashes her almost naked body at him is bound to be a hit.Meanwhile, your Miss Unpopular character will blossom into a full woman, especially when she leads her date to think she wants bondage sex on prom night. And how about that twist at the end? How could anyone guess those two would wind up together?And you'll love the way InstaScript fills in the other 90 minutes of your script by reusing classic movie scenes. Sure, you may know about Cyrano de Bergerac's trick of telling his buddy what to say to the girl. And yes, you've seen the swimming pool idea in It's A Wonderful Life, but don't worry. Nobody coming to see the movies you make with InstaScript is going to be old or wise enough to ever suspect that the following movie has been recycled to fit their screen.(c)2000, One Voice Communications.

And that's really saying something given all the spit-wad plotlines screenwriter Mark Schwahn throws up against the wall hoping something - anything - will stick during this dog's drawn out running time. Not one character, situation or idea elicits the smallest laugh. The cardinal sin of comedies. Even the grating `10 Things I Hate About You' got a laugh here and there.  Following in the standard prototype of the modern teensploitation movie, this generically titled movie builds it's high school setting around a work of classic literature, usually Shakespeare, and in this case `Cyrano DeBergerac'. But it's a slim basis at best, the movie takes more of it's cues from `She's All That', `10 Things' and every other teen movie of 2 years earlier where the characters scheme to get the hottest girls in school, high school is divided sharply on clique based stereotypes and the world of every character of every clique revolves around. (dun, dun, dun) the prom.The one thing `WiT' does right is the casting. The movie is almost watchable by Jodi Lyn O'Keefe and Marla Sokoloff prancing around as the `hot girls'. O'Keefe sends the guilty pleasure meter through the roof in a few juicy freeze-frame scenes. The always adorable Sokoloff even manages to escape with her dignity, which is more than I can say for the rest of the cast including Shane West, James Franco (`Freaks and Geeks'), poor talented Richard Schiff (`The West Wing') as the `PE teacher` and Julia Sweeney in a particular embarrassing role as West's mother/flamboyantly liberal Sex Ed teacher.Every once in a while I start to think one of these movies might have something satirical to say, maybe offer some honest or insight on the high school caste system. Alas, it's not to be as our hero (West) does things that no normal teen would do following the script's phony teen character to a T. Some of the jokes are even so dated one wonders if the movie were delayed a few years. The prom night finale involves a painfully unfunny riff on 'Titanic' (1997!) and around that we've got geeks pulling vandalism stunts, `the most popular girl in school' turning out to be a bitch and a pseudo-climactic race to stop `the most popular guy in school' from implementing his `Sail and Bail' policy on the sweet girl despite everybody knowing full well that she's to smart to fall for it.All of this drags at an uneven pace at the hand of  director David Raynr; feeling like an epic at barely over 90 minutes. It's true teensploitation - constructed in equal parts by a Hollywood contempt for the teenage demographic on full display by Raynr and Schwahn here and a teen audience that gobbles this stuff up again and again. It's got a decent guilty pleasure factor, but you can only get so many miles out of Jodi in the shower before even I want something more.

To underscore the depth of my devotion, let's take a peek at this film. It is the most AWFUL RIP-OFF of classic teen movies ever made. Columbia owes about a dozen studios either credits or apologies.  First, we have the premise--a guy and a girl are next-door neighbours and well, sparks just might fly. They even shout at one another from opposite balconies. Where have we seen this before? Drive Me Crazy (Fox) of course. We also have a onetime nerd who cruelly abandons his nerd friends in order to score with a hot chick--Drive Me Crazy again.  There's also a witchy, misandristic girl protagonist (as seen in Disney's 10 Things I Hate About You). Even the underlying theme of the film--stud wins the heart of mousy girl, nerd wins hot babe--is a steal from Universal's classic Sixteen Candles. Trust me, there is NOTHING original in this movie! Even the nerd with the surprise prom date (Drive Me Crazy), the screechy girl thrusting her yearbook into people's faces for autographs (Columbia's own Can't Hardly Wait) and the prominence of a very unfunny penis joke early in the film (10 Things) are blatant rip-offs.

Teen flicks in general have a tendency to play off of the same premise with little variation or creativity, and are--generally speaking--bad as a genre.  There are a few exceptions, paramount among them Clueless.  This film isn't as horrible and unbearable as 10 Things I Hate About You, and I actually think it was probably a little better than American Pie--although I rather disliked  the latter thus is not a very high compliment for this film either.Quickly, to break it down, I will tell you the main problems with this film. 1) It recycles the horrible Prom is coming up and I want to take the popular girl premise, which seems to be the basis of many a horrible teen movie. 2) The primary conflict doesn't evolve until the movie is half over--up to that point, it is just a waste of time waiting for the primary conflict, and the action is pretty boring. 3) The end is predictable from the the first couple scenes of the movie... not a good thing.

It places its romantic leads within ear shot next door lofts as seen before in Drive Me Crazy. Jodi Lyn O'Keefe plays a high school beauty whom every guy and his dog has their sights on. Marla Sokoloff plays the girl next door who unknowingly is being set up with a snobbish jock. Easily one of the worst teen comedies ever made as it wallows in the muck of lust in perversion offering absolutely nothing new for the wasted ninety minutes. Directed at best by David Raynr with a screenplay that xeroxed nearly every teen comedy made within the previous decade. Sokoloff plays that plain Jane who turns out to be a hottie. O'Keefe plays the dumbest girl on the block but seems to counter that with her looks. This will get old quickly because most guys would ditch her once someone with half a brain comes along. Shane West and James Franco play the two guys with more guts than brains. We have seen this scheme countless times where bets are made either to lose virginity or bed a particular female, and this one may take the cake as being the worst of them all.

"},{"Title":"A Farce trying to be a Comedy","Date":"21 May 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Whatever It Takes is mislabeled as being a Teen Comedy. In actuality it's a Teen Farce that tries to be a Teen Comedy. It fails as a Comedy as the majority of the characters are unabashedly selfish individuals in pursuit of their own selfish desires with close to no redeemable qualities. That's the territory of Farce. Other examples of Teen Farces include the American Pie movies and Not Another Teen Movie. Where Whatever it Takes fails is that it tries to be a Teen Comedy only in the romance between our two unpopular characters, when the rest of the characters and situations fit the genre of a Farce. It's like the two leads got picked up out of a Comic world and were left trapped in a Farcical one. And the fight between the two genres of humor gets this film nowhere-fast.If it were a Comedy it would be more celebratory of the community and interested in bringing members who don't fit in the community into it as full fledged members with a place, a purpose, and a partner. What this film is interested in saying is that the community is too selfish and deserving of punishment to bother joining--which is typically the stuff of Satire or Farce.In a farce there's little to no concern for other people, and body humor frequently goes for grossing people out. Which is what this movie nearly goes out of its way to portray. The entire high school community is composed of a group of selfish individuals, the reason for their being so the movie silently postulates is due to the fact that they have very little care or respect for themselves as individuals--a realization which would work in a Comedy if that realization wasn't being completely undercut with only the minimal in character development and the most ridiculous of gross-out humor. I mean what school teaches safe sex with a giant penis and a giant condom? I almost felt sorry for Ashley, the popular girl, whose character is revealed to have a neurotic mind completely entangled around her low self-esteem, but this realization is coupled in the same moment by her eating a chocolate cake and opening her mouth to reveal the cake's blacked out her teeth. Or that she begs all night on Ryan's lawn to ask to go to prom, only to tear away her dress and reveal the skimpy bikini underneath. That kind of humor belongs in a Farce, but is out of place in a Comedy, and it completely undercuts any sympathy the character might otherwise have developed. Had she not blacked out her teeth or revealed her hidden bikini we could have seen under the veneer of her popularity and seen the scared child who desperately wants to fit in and will put herself into near-emotional abusive situations in order to get negative attention and thus feel gratified. If the movie had actually done that it could have given some more weight to the conflict between Ryan realizing his feelings for Ashley, and now feeling obligated to show Ashley how to stand up for herself and be confident in being her own person (in a John Hughes manner recalling Some Kind of Wonderful). However the opportunity is missed as the film would rather make jokes about how hot the actress is and how horny her character is--that she doesn't even notice that Ryan is replaced with another boy and still has sex with him.The soulful parts such as Ryan realizing that he actually likes Maggie as he tells Chris how to woo her in the theater, are lifted from its source material of Cyrano D'Bergerac. The rest of the movie and its sense of humor is more appropriate for a farce, which if you watch the special features seems to be the kind of humor the director is entertained by the most and pushed the actors towards in his direction.In the end the script should have seen a few more revisions to either take out the farcical humor and add some redeeming heartfelt qualities to the high school community and its most popular students, or fully embraced the farcical nature of its humor and dehumanized its pair of unpopular kids and thus be the precursor to Not Another Teen Movie.Either would have been better than this awkward film that can't make up its mind about what genre it is.

Besides the respectable performances of the four leads and the catchy soundtrack, whatever small redeeming factors Whatever it Takes had quickly diminished after the first twenty minutes.I'm known to like a lot of high school movies where dorky teenagers lust after the girl of their dreams, and Whatever it Takes almost lured me in until it started walking into every cheap little trap. Right off the bat, anyone who thinks the dream girl is perfect and that the popular kid is going to follow through with his promise clearly hasn't seen any teenage movies.The plot Nerdy kid Ryan (West) is desperately trying to get a date with Ashley (O'Keefe), the school dream girl. Jocky Chris (Franco) is trying hard to score a date with Maggie (Sokoloff), the school geek. Chris offers to help Ryan with his date if Ryan helps Chris with his. The two agree and venture out through double dates and each others' smart advice to win over their love interests.What bothers me is Whatever it Takes does nothing to change the formula. The characters don't act like real-life teenagers at all, they act like poorly created, dim shadows of who they should be playing. West and Franco are not to blame. They are just playing the characters. They didn't write the material they are saying. Both, at that time small, actors do what they can with the paper thin material they have, and needless to say, it all goes in a fair matter.My favorite character was Marla Sokoloff's who played the rebellious teen girl Gia in the nineties sitcom Full House. Years later, she is playing a totally different role, still with her beauty and wit taking a front row seat in the ride.The most frustrating scene in the film, besides the end scene that is abysmal, is the scene in the nursing home. Besides thinking flatulence will get you a cheap laugh, Whatever it Takes spits the few moments in a film I'll never understand; the I take it back moments.In this skit, Chris is talking to Maggie in the nursing home discussing her role in theater. Chris says We have a theater club? when Maggie brings up that she's in it. Maggie replies with the I-can't-believe-you-just-said-that what? as anybody would. Chris says something like I mean that's cool. The rest of the scene flows as if he never just insulted her hobby like it was unimportant.Why are movie characters so natural and so not concerned when someone just asks a stupid question that insults them. Once he/she reminds themself that what they just said was idiotic, they say something that sounds nothing like what they just said and continue as if it never happened. Just arbitrary.While scenes like that are unnecessary and an insult to the actors and filmmakers, some little moments make Whatever it Takes watchable. It certainly is forgotten, but it might get some sort of revival now that James Franco is making it in the world of acting. Though that may happen, it certainly is likely, that the only recognition he will get from this is the oh wow, he used to do crappy films response from many.Starring Shane West, James Franco, Jody Lyn O'Keefe, and Marla Sokoloff.

None of the main characters had any real chemistry, and the storyline was tried and contrived--two guys scheme together to get two girls. I had a hard time believing that a seemingly sharp and slightly cynical girl like Maggie could fall for Chris' awkward attempts to impress her. I don't see a girl like that falling for romance and poetry unless it was really authentic, and I certainly cannot imagine that she would actually fall for his obvious act. As for the other lead girl, Ashley, she was just difficult to watch all together, not to mention that she was far less attractive than Maggie, and even the girls who played her friends.

Jodi is, without a doubt, a pretty young actress, but her snobby character makes her totally unappealing.  Unappealing to the point where you wonder why the boy likes her in the first place!

Geez, I wonder who he's going to fall in love with.  Don't worry, it's not a spoiler.  Any fool can see that coming.  And if you can't--seek help. Though the plot is a complete throwaway with forgettable elements left and right, the film's handled in a fresh, upbeat fashion.

Ryan is a very sensible guy, his nerd friends are very weird and has a crush in Ashley Grant (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe). Ashley is a shallow but popular, beautiful and sexy girl in their high school. Her cousin Chris Campbell (James Franco) is a brainless and dumb American football player, who wants to have a date with Maggie. Ryan and Chris make a deal each one of them will introduce and help the other to be with the girl of their dreams.

His role of Ryan Woodman really didn't let him shine as an actor.  His next role to follow this, Get Over It, seemed even worse than the role in Whatever It Takes.  I'd have to say that if you want to see Shane at his best you should check out A Walk To Remember.   In Whatever It Takes you really want everything to work out for Ryan.  Yes, the movie is as cheesy as it gets, but if you overlook that, and some bad acting, you get a semi-decent movie. Marla Sokoloff does a good job of making her character Maggie Carter down to earth and real.  I believe she has one of the stronger roles in this movie, although I really want to see Marla in better movie roles.  She is a great actress on the tv show The Practice, but her movie roles haven't been top notch.  She played Wilma, the twin of Jennifer Garner's Wanda, in the 2000 flop Dude, Where's My Car.  Following that she played Lisa in Sugar & Spice, another flop.  Many of Marla's acting attempts on the big screen have been flops, and I hope she doesn't get grouped into that corny teen actor genre --- such as stars like Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Jason Biggs have. Jodi Lyn O'Keefe plays popular and mean girl Ashley Grant.  Ahh yes, another popular and mean girl.  Every teen movie has to have at least one.  She takes it overboard in this movie.  I think the role was just written to be overboard.  I just feel sorry for Jodi Lyn who seems to be grouped into that corny teen actor genre I listed above.  Poor Jodie was Taylor in She's All That where she played Freddie Prinze, Jr.'s popular and mean ex girlfriend.  I see a real talent in Ms. O'Keefe, but I think she should stay away from these types of roles she is best known for. Finally, rounding out the cast is James Franco, pretty face and bad boy spirit.  Best known as playing James Dean (another pretty face with bad boy spirit) in 2001's TV Movie of the same title as the character he plays, he just doesn't seem to be that strong of an actor in Whatever It Takes.  But that's okay because none of the actors were that strong in their acting, but they have the potential to be better, with some of them already proving they are better than this (Shane West).  This was also one of Franco's first movies so that may be another reason the acting wasn't as strong as it could be. The movie's plot was a modern day Cyrano DeBergerac.  This concept seems like it would have worked well, but I think the script was poorly written.  Most teen movies do have poor written scripts, but I think this was one of the poorest of them all.  But all actors and actresses learn and grow from their early work, and I'm sure all of these actors and actresses will go on to have great carreers in the future.1 of 4 stars.

If you ask me, Ashley (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) was, indeed, a very popular, as well as pretty, high school senior. Also, I thought that she, Ryan (Shane West), Maggie (Marla Sokoloff), and Chris (James Franco) looked good in the attire they wore to the prom. That was one of my most favorite parts of the movie. This was because a lot of wacky things happened then. I especially liked the after-prom party. My reason for that is because it took place in a hotel. That makes me wish I had been invited to a party like that when I was a senior in high school. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, Bets like that are stupid. I think you should let the person you love fall in love with you rather than wooing them.

I laughed my ass off when Ashley was on the lawn begging to her prom date. I laughed at the Cyrano-inspired name the nerds scene. The handshake scene was good.So, don't pay money to see this. But if it's coming on, give it a try.2009 Comment I just caught it again (7 years after the first viewing) and I still love this movie, even after my Marla Sokoloff crush has worn off.Many people may disagree, but I liked the treatment of sexual attraction in high school. The popular cheerleader types date the jerks, not because they're attractive or that's what's expected of them... it's because the popular girls are jerks, too. Acting jerky doesn't work on nice girls, like Maggie, however. Nor does it work for Ryan's friend Floyd, who takes it too far with a firecracker, especially because he doesn't have Ryan or the jocks' natural good looks.But the jerks have some depth Chris's character is awkward and frustrated around Maggie just as Ryan is awkward and frustrated around Ashley. Neither guy is after a girl who is right for him. The only difference between them is their motivations.Similarly, when *SPOILER* Ryan breaks up with Ashley, she doesn't act nasty and become defensive like you might expect in other teen movies. Instead, she tries to make up for her mistake even though she doesn't really get what she's done wrong. Although she's a jerk and was difficult to woo, she does actually have feelings for him. *END SPOILER*And because our jerks have feelings, it's a bit of a put off when in the end they dispose of the jerks like every other teen movie. It's a trite end to an otherwise well-executed teen movie.Still 7/10, maybe even 8.

I didn't think today's film makers knew who John Hughes was let alone could emulate even his subpar work.  In the 80's, as I was growing up, you had sweet, funny, but honest comedies like Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, Pretty In Pink and then other hilarious films like Fasttimes at Ridgemont High.  These films entertained you and kept you wanting more. They were honest with their humour. But then they just disappeared.  Maybe it was that Hughes and Heckerling wanted to make adult comedies like Planes Trains... and Look Who's Talking.  I'm not sure but somewhere along the way they became extinct.  But then something magical happened last year.  After the previous successes of okay films like Can't Harldy Wait and Ten Things I Hate About You, along comes American Pie.  Now American Pie took all that was great about the 80's teen comedies and made it into one hell of a funny film that all generations could enjoy.  It revitalized a somewhat stale market.  And as great as that is, it is also not so great in the way that you have any idiot with a computer trying to cash in on that craze.  Whatever It Takes, is one of those films.  I'm not saying it is absolutely terrible, it's just simply not that great.  But this film will probably go on to gross somewhere around 15 million and that will probably be a profit for the studio and then it will be considered a success.  And then more sub-par films will get made and more teens will go see them and they will not realize that just one generation before them is a library full of the quintessential teen films that are funny, exciting, filled with bathroom humour, nudity, drugs, partying, puking, teens wearing bras on their heads, masturbation, voyeurism, sex sex and more sex.  Films from the 80's were the pioneers of the teen genre and when I read comments in here that a film like this one is  the best teen comedy around   I feel sorry for the kids today if they feel that way because that obviously means that you have not seen some the great films from the 80's.  What a shame!The story is quite simple here.  Maggie and Brian live next door to each other and both are just friends.  Both are attractive people but they don't see the intrigue in one another.  They both either want other gorgeous people in school or are coveted by someone else.  And so when the school jock tells Brian that he can hook him up with Ashley, the schools ditziest, most self centered, conceited but most gorgeous girl, he jumps at the chance.  There is only one catch.  Brian has to help jocko get Maggie. Now Maggie is the best written character in the film.  For the most part she seems genuine and honest.  And she is beautiful.  To put the two of them side by side ( Maggie and Ashley ) one wonders why Brian wouldn't have gone for his friend long ago.  But that is besides the point.  The point is, that this is where the film fails miserably.  Maggie is too real of a character for this film.  She actually looks like she was a substitute character for the film American Pie that was cut at the last minute and then drafted by the creator's of this film.  Why she would fall for the school jock that has as much charm and wit as a doorknob is not fair to her character.  She is better than that.  And this is where the film falls.  Too many situations are just flat and there are too many characters that are just caricatures of a comic book person.  They do things that no other teen does, they act like no other teen does and they talk like no other teen does.  It would have been nice if only once or maybe even twice the character did one thing that seemed real, not like it was written by four or five guys in a screenplay.  That would have given the film a much more authentic quality to it.Whatever it Takes isn't all bad.  It does have it's humourous moments but not enough of them to save a poor screenplay.  There is a reason American Pie made $100 million at the box-office and why a film like this one won't.  It's called honesty in your humour.  Pie has it....Takes doesn't.

Answer  it's because of the 1995 hit CLUELESS, twenty-something cast playing teens, modern music soundtrack, and it's a take on Jane Austen's tale, EMMA.  Now it's CYRANO DeBERGERAC's turn on a film that is aimed for the teens, and it's called WHATEVER IT TAKES.  However, it doesn't succeed that much. WHATEVER is about two very good friends, Ryan Woodman (Shane West) and Sloane (Christine Lakin).  They are next door neighbors, they share a ride to school, and they are both not among the popular group in school.  But, Ryan has a crush on the very popular Maggie Carter (Marla Sokoloff), and the school jock, Chris Campbell (James Franco) has a crush on Sloane.  So Ryan and Chirs work out a deal to try to get the girls of their dreams.  It isn't until that when Ryan is helping Chris, that he begins to fall in love with Sloane, and.... well, you know what happens. WHATEVER can't seem to make up it's mind on what kind of a film it wants to be like CLUELESS or AMERICAN PIE.  It has the cutesy and romantic bits from CLUELESS, and it also has the raunchy and dirty jokes that might have been thrown out of AMERICAN PIE and put into this film.  The beginning of the film is a little promising, it does have some funny parts, but by the second half, it gets predictable, and it falls flat.  After seeing a lot of these recent teen films, I'm beginning to enjoy CLUELESS a lot more, which I originally hated when it first came out.  At least CLUELESS was trying something new, that Hollywood is doing all the time now. The acting is so-so, Shane West reminds me of the little brother of Chandler Banks (Matthew Perry) on the t.v. show FRIENDS.  He panics, he questions people's actions and attitudes, and he's clumsy.  And I don't know why a character like Ryan would fall for Maggie before falling for Sloane. Sloane is much more attractive, and friendlier.  Why would Ryan be so blind to not see the beauty in Sloane, and see the erotic side in Maggie?  But as for Christine Lakin, she does a good job in her role, she is much more attractive than Marla Sokoloff. And this film lacks some originality, from pulling the ultimate prank at the senior prom, to taking famous bits from CYRANO.  There's even the famous part where Cyrano is helping with wooing Roxanne while behind the bushes.  And the character of Floyd (Aaron Paul) seems to have stepped in from DAZE & CONFUSED or AIRHEADS and into this film, he was way out of place.What really gets me is how did this film get a 'PG-13' rating?  There are male organ jokes, even showing a model of one in the school auditorium; bare behinds, and even a lot of innuendo coming from Marla Sokoloff.  Director David Hubbard even steals the Rob Reiner opening scene from SURE THING of having extreme close-ups of Sokoloff getting ready for school while she's making herself look pretty.  All I can say is if one wants to see a witty and funny remake of CYRANO DE BERGERAC, then watch the 1987 classic ROXANNE with Steve Martin and Daryl Hannah.  At least ROXANNE has the character with the long nose, WHATEVER, well, it will ruin the teenager's image, since teens go by looks and not soul.  ** (out of five) "},{"Title":"Another Teen Movie?

The movie is about an average high schooler with a heart of gold, Ryan (Shane West), who lusts after the school's gorgeous but shallow queen of popularity (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) Ashley Grant. Unable to attain this dream girl, he strikes a deal with her sleazy cousin (James Franco), who is infatuated with Ryan's gorgeous but unnoticed best friend (Marla Solokoff). Pulling a page out of 'Cyrano', the two instruct each other on how to talk and act in order to get to the hearts of their respective females. One word Gag. The main problem with the movie is that it does not know how to deliver what it wants to. None of the actors in the movie seem to know what they want to accomplish, except for Franco, who seems hell bent on doing his worst impersonations of Fonzie and Joey from 'Friends'. All of the characters are template and manufactured, clones of all teen movies that came before this.As a drama, the story tries to take on some flakes of originality, but the screenwriters seem too scared to break out on their own, assuming that teens only like being served the same hash and re-hash every time we go to the theater. And if you can't guess what happens by the end of the movie within the first five minutes, then by all means shell out the cash for the ticket. As a comedy, this movie is seemingly devoid of humor, save a few jokes about farting and vomiting here and there. But for almost two hours, this movie toggles between lunacy and idiocy, leaving the audience willing to do whatever it takes to get their money back.

In other words, an utopia for the new century. Even though Whatever it Takes may have been influenced on the surface by Rostand's long nosed romantic miscreant, it really falls in line with John Hughes' two fisted romantic romps of the 80's Pretty in Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful. All these films deal with the strained relationship between a pair of life long friends when an affair of the heart presents itself. Whatever's problems stem from the fact both leads who are supposedly intelligent can't see the forest for the trees. Sokoloff and West are very engaging and great to look at but to assume old friends will be become new lovers strains the tenets of logic. Love may be blind but does it necessarily have to be dumb as well, even in this day and age?

I heard Richard Schiff was in it, which drew me slightly, but the reason I gave in and had a look was because it featured Shane West. There are a few men in the film industry who could take parts where they read from the phone book and I'd still be interested, and Shane West is one of them. (And no, I'm not a teenage girl, I'm older than Shane.)It's not a great movie. It's not even a particularly good movie. The performances are delivered with reasonable enthusiasm and yes, Shane is pretty. But it's not a cinematic masterpiece.However, that said -- this movie has one absolutely hilarious scene that makes it worth the effort to rent, or even buy if you spot it in the bargain bin like my friend did. Shane's character Ryan, at one point, can be seen wearing nothing but boxer shorts and a cowboy hat, with an accordion strapped to his chest, dancing around to Play That Funky Music White Boy. It is the most stupidly hysterical thing I have ever seen and I about fell off the sofa laughing. I guarantee you cannot watch this scene with a straight face, so the next time you're in dire need of a laugh, look for this movie and find that part!

If you ask me, Ashley (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) was, indeed, a very popular, as well as pretty, high school senior. Also, I thought that she, Ryan (Shane West), Maggie (Marla Sokoloff), and Chris (James Franco) looked good in the attire they wore to the prom. That was one of my most favorite parts of the movie. This was because a lot of wacky things happened then. I especially liked the after-prom party. My reason for that is because it took place in a hotel. That makes me wish I had been invited to a party like that when I was a senior in high school. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, Bets like that are stupid. I think you should let the person you love fall in love with you rather than wooing them. Now, in conclusion, if you're a fan of Jodi Lyn O'Keefe, Shane West, Marla Sokoloff, or James Franco, I highly recommend this sweet, charming, hilarious, and heartwarming romantic teen comedy, that is, if you haven't seen it.

Instead, we get Yasmine Bleeth (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) and Doogie Howser (Shane West) lookalikes, and two cute but otherwise non-descript actors making up the foursome of this teen romance movie.Though I could only wish to have a friendship like the characters of West and Sokoloff share since childhood, the result is predictable even if you WERE born in 1985. I shouldn't be unfair to West or Marla Sokoloff, who give this film its heart and are the only two interesting actors to watch and may actually find careers in Hollywood.Perhaps the problem then is with this movie, which falls into a crowded category right now with She's All That, Drive Me Crazy, and the current crownholder American Pie.What is enjoyable about this film are the laughs. There are a lot of them. When you see how West's geeky friends spend their Friday nights at home, when you see them discover the irony in the prom theme being Titanic Dreams (People on the Titanic DIED!!), when the gym coach who thinks he's more than he is comes away with less than he had before. Some laughs will be louder than others, some will make you embarrassed you thought it was funny, but you will laugh.But if you want a story, and you don't want to look back to 1985, I recommend picking up She's All That.

It seems to me that it is a combination of the two.  It has plenty of the coming of age hijinks and jokes that get a laugh, and also includes a caring plot in the background throughout the movie.  You'll probably see it coming, but the laughs and the humor along the way make the predictability seem irrelevant.I'm not much into the classic's but when I was forced to read Cyrano in high school, I really liked it.  This movie picks up and modernizes the classic Shakespeare novel without being overt.  It really helped me enjoy it that much more.  Also, throughout the movie, there are a few jokes which are references to other movies and incorporates them with a refreshing sense of humor that will make you chuckle.  Watch for them and see how many that you can pick out.Overall, a good movie without a lot of violence, profanity, or nudity.

The main story is Cyrano de Bergerac times two.  Two boys who pine after different girls help one another by feeding one another lines that will win the girls' hearts.  This is a clever variation on a very old theme.  Writer Mark Schwan should have stayed closer to the main plot rather than throwing in so much superfluous teen fluff.  The story was greatly diminished by the inclusion of the three geeks.  The prom swimming pool scene was a direct rip-off from `It's a Wonderful Life' and done nowhere near as well.The story does capture a lot of the frustration of being a teenager and getting that special girl/boy to notice you exist.  It had some real moments, lent greater weight by surprisingly good acting from a young cast.  Shane West was very sincere as the accordion playing and socially invisible Ryan.  He and Marla Sokoloff (Maggie) gave excellent dramatic performances and outdistanced the rest of the cast.  Jodi Lyn O'Keefe (Ashley) and James Franco (Chris) were also good but not equal to the former as the popular but superficial high school idols.This film has a difficult time in a crowded genre with some tough competition.

But the characters make it different from most. Aaron Paul was made for the character Floyd. This movie gets better every time you watch it!

The characters were so absurd it was funny.  The one kid who dressed like a retard was great, as was the actual down syndrome characteristics of Jodi Lynn O'Keefe and whoever the villain was.  A must see, if you think you are somehow above this movie because you are too smart for it, you are obviously attempting to mask your stupidity with a false sense of class.

Sure, it was pleasant enough and fairly entertaining; there were certainly some laughs and the gorgeous female leads don't hurt matters either. The fact is the film was completely predictable throughout and thoroughly not believable in most respects. Some of the better films of this genre (10 Things I Hate About You, Bring it On, Can't Hardly Wait) are somewhat realistic in their portrayal of high school life and students, but this one fell short. Overall, worth a rental if you're in the mood for an amusing teen flick, but keep expectations LOW. Rating 5 out of 10.

I found it to be a very good movie. I even own it on DVD! Shane West is sooo cute!!! The movie consists of a very good cast, and I find that I am able to easily watch this movie over and over again!!!  "}]
