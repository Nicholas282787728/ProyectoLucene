[{"Title":"unusual and intriguing romantic drama","Date":"24 August 2002","Score":"56 out of 63 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  `Possession' has all the intricacy, mystery and suspense of a classic piece of detective fiction.  What sets this film apart, however, is that the object of the mystery does not involve a dead body, a piece of stolen treasure or a missing person, but rather the hitherto secret love affair between two well-known 19th Century English poets.   The clues come in the form of journal entries, love letters and snippets of enigmatic poetry that, when pieced together, afford a glimpse into the inner yearnings of these two young, but essentially unrequited lovers.As a narrative, `Possession' runs on two parallel tracks, one set in modern times (that's where the detective story aspect comes in) and the other set in 1859, as we learn the details of the romance that took place between the writers.  In the contemporary plot strand, Aaron Eckhart stars as Roland Michell, a handsome young American research assistant who has come to England to study the work of famed poet Randolph Henry Ash, a writer with a certain misogynistic strain who nevertheless enjoys the rather unique reputation among poets of having been utterly faithful to his wife.  As the story begins, Ash has become something of a cause celebre within British literary circles because the year 2000 happens to mark the centenary of the discovery of his work.  While poring over a first edition copy of one of Ash's volumes, Roland stumbles across some original letters of Ash's that hint at the possibility that Ash, contrary to the public impression of his marital fidelity, may actually have had an affair with another famed poet of the time, a Miss Christabel La Motte, a woman believed by her biographers to have been a lesbian.  Confronted with this startling, revolutionary and, perhaps, priceless piece of information, Roland sets out to unravel the mystery, accompanied by Maud Bailey (Gwyneth Paltrow), an expert on the life and work of Miss LaMotte (and a distant descendant of that famed poet in the bargain).`Possession' earns points automatically simply by providing us with a unique storyline and a fascinating glimpse into a world we have rarely if ever seen portrayed on screen - the world of literary investigation.  We are fascinated by all the behind-the-scene details showing not merely the investigative footwork that goes into unearthing the biographical details of a writer's life, but also the sometimes-cutthroat nature that propels rival investigators to both make and publish their discoveries, even if that means utilizing tactics that can be described as, at best, unethical, and, at worst, illegal.But `Possession' offers more than just that.  It also manages to provide not merely one, but two complex romances occurring at the same time (though a full century apart in the context of the story).  Randolph and Christabel are both products - and victims - of their Victorian Era morality, yet at the same time, their struggles are universal in nature and neatly correspond to those experienced by Roland and Maud, who literally follow in the footsteps of the earlier couple.  As our modern day investigators travel the same route through England that Randolph and Christabel took a century previous, Roland and Maud reveal much about their own inability to make commitments in the face of possible true love.  As they tentatively grope towards one another, then back away out of fear of pain and rejection, Roland and Maud define, in many ways, the métier of modern romantic coupling.  Yet, we discover, through Randolph and Christabel, that life in the past really wasn't much different from what it is today.Based on the novel by A.S. Byatt, the David Henry Hwang/Laura Jones/Neil LaBute screenplay provides highly charged scenes between our two romantic couples, particular those involving Roland and Maud.  The dialogue in these encounters is often sharp, intelligent, incisive.  The romantic moments between Raymond and Christabel have a slightly more conventional feel to them, but they, too, often ring true in a way that is both deeply moving and strangely exciting.  Director LaBute has drawn wonderful performances out of his quartet of first-rate actors.  Aaron Eckhart as Roland and Jennifer Ehle as Christabel are particularly effective in their roles.It's refreshing to see a romantic drama that manages to generate some actual chemistry between its two on-screen lovers.  In the case of `Possession,' our pleasure is thereby doubled, since the film accomplishes this with not merely one couple but two.   `Possession' may not provide the blood, gore, corpses and hair-raising thrills one usually associates with detective fiction, but its devotion to the drama found in words, poetry, language and romance makes for no less an engrossing experience.

Sadly, the filmmakers have missed out on most of the central themes of the novel, without substituting a sufficiently interesting interpretation of their own.A.S. Byatt's novel examines the shifting relationships between men and women a century and a half apart - to that end, the characters in the two storylines (the Victorian and the contemporary) mirror each other deliberately. For some unfathomable reason, the screenwriters have decided to cut out completely two crucial characters from the modern-time storyline - Val, Roland's girlfriend, and the feminist (and Lesbian) researcher friend of Maud's, whose name I forget  - their equivalents in the Victorian period are Ash's wife, and Christabel's lover Blanche.One of the main interests of the original story lies in the ways in which the relationships between those characters have changed because of the changes in society that the 20th century has brought - particularly the way the main characters relate to each other (significantly, Maud is the stronger and more successful person in the modern-time relationship) - but also with respect to all the other characters involved (Roland and Val's relationship, which is based almost exclusively on sex, as contrasted with Ash's and his wife's relationship, which is entirely sex-less - the point here being that in a truly fulfilled relationship, these two things must be in balance).Also, the characters, particularly that of Roland, are bent and twisted beyond recognition - I have nothing against Aaron Eckhard or his performance, but he simply plays a completely different character from the Roland Mitchell of the novel - who is *not* brash (nor is he celibate), but has a certain mousy-ness about him that is quite essential to the plot. Also, he is British for a reason, so making him into an American adds a completely wrong dimension to his and Maud's differences. Judging from the director's commentary, the main reason for casting Eckhard was that he's a buddie of director Neil La Bute's - it's a sad thing that the filmmakers decided to twist the character and plot to accomodate the actor, rather than making a more informed casting choice, as I am sure there are plenty of suitable British actors out there that would have fitted the part admirably.Gwyneth Paltrow offers a convincing enough performance, and is well-cast as Maud Bailey - a woman whose physical attractiveness stands in the way of her being taken seriously as the bright academic she is. But she is not being given enough scope to be the reserved intellectual she is supposed to be, because her relationship with Roland developes far too quickly, and with not enough plausibility (particularly given a certain lack of chemistry between the two actors) - thereby missing another of the main themes (and contrasts) in the novel.Having said that, the film is worth watching for its final five minutes alone - and incidentally, this is the one scene that catches most accurately the spirit, and the point, of the original novel.

First of all, Neil LaBute captured the snobbery of the whole academic scene very well, albeit very briefly.  However, the British characters make so much comment about the fact that he's an American, that it borders on the ridiculous.  Most of the actual British people I've met actually like Americans, and although they make the occasional joke about them, they don't carry on like the academicians in the movie.  The point I am making is that the other characters seem to emphasize Roland's brashness so much that Roland doesn't even have a chance to show what he's truly made of, why he's there working with Professor Blackadder, over any dozens of other graduate students (British or not) who could have had his place. Much has been said about making the character of Roland an American. Actually, I think that the choice of bringing an American into the academic mix not only changes this from something more suited to Masterpiece Theatre TV to something worthy of the big screen.  Roland is the outsider in the book, a lower-class Brit, but he is also someone who harbors poetic aspirations and more passion for his chosen subject (Ash) than any of his colleagues.  The fact that he is an American in the movie helps to emphasize his outsider identity.  But the audience is never truly shown this at all in the movie. This is the true misstep of the movie (and I have a feeling that perhaps some of it is on the cutting room floor)  Roland's character is so underdeveloped in the movie that anyone coming to the movie without having read the book cannot help but feel he is a fish-out-of-water. Sure, they have scenes of Roland reading a book of Ash poetry and a brief flash of Roland writing poetry in a notebook.  But the latter scene seemed to exist only for Gwyneth Paltrow's character (Maud Bailey) to have another opportunity to make fun of Roland, and not to help reveal any sort of depth to his character. As a fan of the book, I did enjoy the movie after all.  The Victorian scenes were especially beautiful and I loved the seamless cutting between past and present in the same spaces, the same rooms.  Since my only misgiving is that it was too short, I feel that LaBute was successful in his adaptation...I guess I will have to look to the DVD to see if he had intended to flesh out Roland's character more.  Unfortunately, Roland is never even given a chance to show what he's made of, except for the fact that he steals a letter from a book -- the catalyst of both the movie and the book.  His American-ness in this case -- his boldness and his guile -- is a good thing.  It's just too bad that we don't see more of why he likes Ash so much and what really motivates him to take up the literary chase with Maud...and this is why I would recommend to anyone who's enjoyed the movie that they should read the book...it will amaze you how much LaBute managed to keep in, and it will astound you to become more acquainted with the quadrangle of characters and their individual passions and motivations.  "},{"Title":"A Totally New Perspective from Neil LaBute","Date":"25 August 2002","Score":"20 out of 25 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  A rose by any other name is still a rose; and so it is with love.  And whether or not history reflects any of the great love stories of the past accordingly and/or contextually correct, it does not alter the fact of it.  The rose of the romance four generations later, for example, may become known as the lily; neither does that alter the fact of what was, nor of what is, all of these decades later, indelibly etched upon the mind's eye of eternity.  `Possession,' directed by Neil LaBute, is just such a story, within a story; one the actual passion of which may have been inadvertently diminished, however, through the misinterpretation of the chroniclers who years before set it all down in annals made figuratively of stone, and which, once set, forever after endured.  A romantic film of an even more romantic notion, it's a twofold tale of love, the stories of which, though separated by generations, are in the end, in nature one and the same.  Because, as this film so richly reveals, love indeed lives eternal, and is borne on the very same flame throughout the ages.Roland Michell (Aaron Eckhart), an American, is in London on a fellowship researching the life and work of 19th Century poet Randolph Henry Ash (Jeremy Northam), poet laureate to Queen Victoria.  History recognizes Ash as a dedicated and faithful husband, and his love poems-- purportedly written to or about his wife-- are considered to be among his most noteworthy accomplishments.  In the course of his studies, however, Michell happens across some passionate letters written by Ash to a woman; a woman who is, without question, not his wife.  And all evidence points to poetess Christabel LaMotte (Jennifer Ehle) as being the receiver of the letters-- and of Ash's affections.  Galvanized by the thought that he may have discovered something that would change history, he seeks out Dr. Maud Bailey (Gwyneth Paltrow), currently doing research of her own on LaMotte, in hopes that she will assist him in his quest to uncover the truth about Ash.  Initially skeptical, Bailey acquiesces, and together they set out across England, following what appears to be the trail of Ash and LaMotte's movements during what Michell and Bailey calculate to have been the period of the romantic interlude between the poets.  And what follows is a journey of discovery for Michell and Bailey; about the tenets of truth, history, and most importantly, about love.LaBute, Laura Jones and David Henry Hwang wrote the screenplay for this film, adapted from the novel by A.S. Byatt.  And for LaBute, known for such films as `Your Friends and Neighbors,' `Nurse Betty' and the scathing `In the Company of Men,' it's an artistic turn of 180 degrees.  Absent are the misogynists and narcissists who typically populate his landscapes, replaced by characters the audience can warm to, if not embrace entirely.  First and foremost, this is an enthralling love story, made all the more so by LaBute's sensitive and sensible presentation.  Visually, it is stunning, as well; Jean-Yves Escoffier's masterful cinematography fully captures the exquisite beauty of the setting, which complements the romance and makes for an entirely transporting experience.  What makes this film altogether satisfying, however, is that LaBute (via Byatt) manages to transcend the dominant romantic aspects of it, interjecting a very subtle consideration of established social precepts and principles, as well.  There is a decided sense of Ibsen about it, in attitude, outlook and especially in the suggestion of the `roles' men and women are assigned according to the dictates of `Society,' both then and now.  And there is an obvious parallel drawn between the characters of LaMotte and Bailey.  Generations later, Bailey has become the person LaMotte aspired to be, and would have been except for the constraints of the times, exemplified by the direction LaMotte's life necessarily had to take, as compared with the options Bailey would enjoy in the same situation today.The casting of this film could not have been better, beginning with LaBute stalwart Eckhart, who perfectly realizes the character of Michell.  Through his performance, he manages to carry the pivotal role of the film, without making his character the focus.  Michell is central to the story, but it is not `about' him, though Eckhart does give him something of an enigmatic presence, revealing just enough about him to maintain interest, but no more.  Eckhart directs attention to what Michell is doing, rather than who he is, which successfully effects the desired results, and makes the film work.From the moment she appears on screen, Gwyneth Paltrow is a commanding presence.  Her initial entrance is fairly inauspicious, and yet when she steps into the room the eye is automatically drawn to her; it's one of those cinematic ` moments' destined to remain suspended in time.  She imbues Maud with a confident reserve which enables her to dominate the scenes she shares with Eckhart, pointing up not only her considerable ability as an actor, but Eckhart's generosity.  Beyond all of which, Paltrow has eyes that draw you in like tractor beams.The players who make this film so emotionally engaging, however, are Jennifer Ehle and Jeremy Northam.  With acting souls seemingly tempered for period piece drama, Ehle (`Pride and Prejudice') and Northam (`Wuthering Heights,' `Carrington') make the perfect LaMotte and Ash.  In Ehle's Christabel, we discern a character of independence and strength, beneath which lies the romantic nature of the poet; in Northam's Ash we find gentleness and charm, a dreamer who seeks out and finds that which is beautiful and good about the world, the spirit of which he manifests in his work.  Their respective performances are elegant, and there is a definite chemistry between them that renders the romance viable and convincing.The supporting cast includes Trevor Eve (Cropper), Toby Stephens (Fergus), Tom Hickey (Blackadder) and Lena Headey (Christabel's friend).  `Possession' is an excursion into new territory for LaBute, and the result is a memorable, transfixing experience for his audience.  10/10.

The director navigates two parallel story lines &#150; one taking place between two secret lovers in the mid-1800s and one taking place between two soon-to-be-lovers in the 21st century &#150; the latter couple finding their romance as they are unlocking the lovestory of the former... through letters. The bad news is that the director only put his heart into one of the story lines, namely the costume one, and as a result, the modern day lovestory between Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart as literary sleuths suffers greatly. Nevertheless, Possession makes for an OK diversion into quasi-romance.Starting in the positive end then, period-junkies Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle are breathtaking to watch as poets during the Richmond period in England. They are two people who cannot be together, for one has chosen a wife and the other has chosen a life of 'shared solitude' (which is a euphemism for a lesbian relationship). Yet they begin a correspondence of love letters, which blossoms into a fully-fletched romance, embroidered in intrigue and quiet passion. Ehle's beautiful, reassuring smiles conveying the latter. At times their story is achingly romantic, so I think this aspect is very nicely tended to in the film. The graceful words in their letters even invests the film in a lyrical flow of sorts.For our modern day story, Gwyneth Paltrow plays the icy literary expert Maud Bailey, who is also a descendant of Ehle's character, but clearly lacking in her passion. The film offers no satisfying explanation as to why the chilly Maud suddenly warms up and falls for Roland (Eckhart), other than they they are researching the lost letters together. I love Eckhart, but truly believe he is all wrong for this part. He ends up clumsy and flat and underdeveloped in the film (the novel probably offered more insight into his character, I don't know) and again, Maud's attraction to him seems far-fetched. I really can't stress how bad their storyline is; no description will do it justice.Otherwise, Possession does a fair job of melting themes of love and love lost as it progresses and it occasionally manages thrilling. In order to get events unfolding, Maud and Roland unlock the mystery of the ancient lovestory by conveniently appearing clues, hidden hatches and notes. It's into Da Vinci Code territory with this approach to plot, but it works to a point. There is also seamless, fluent intercutting of the two parallel stories in the editing process. Neither a very solid nor very interesting template here, but Possession does make for a fine pastime. 6 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Unexpectedly Magical Film!","Date":"8 June 2005","Score":"24 out of 34 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":" I recently watched Possession and went into it with low expectations...counting on it to compare with some of Paltrow's other flops like Bounce or Duets, but I am thrilled to say I was pleasantly surprised by this film.

So right off the bat, I was pleased by that!Possession is an extremely intelligent film that oozes with intrigue as Paltrow and Eckhart race to solve the mystery of a heart-wrenching romantic scandal taken from history. It weaves together a relatable modern-day romance with an irresistibly passionate Victorian love story. This film is very out of the box and unexpected...an extremely unconventional romance that makes you think. I love those and think you will too!

Following her performances in Emma, Sliding Doors and Shakespeare In Love, for the fourth time Paltrow adopts an impeccable English accent.This time she plays an academic specialising in the work of an obscure 19th century poet called Christabel LaMotte (Jennifer Ehle, whom I enjoyed in This Year's Love). She is approached by an American researcher, Roland Michell, played by a permanently unshaven Aaron Eckhart, who has discovered a possible romantic connection between LaMotte and fellow poet Randolph Henry Ash (Jeremy Northam, last seen in that other costume drama Gosford Park). It turns out that Ash's marriage has no physical side (for reasons which are not explained), while LaMotte's lesbian relationship may not be as exclusive as was thought.All this sounds more raunchy that it is. There is in fact little sex and no nudity at all on show; yet director Neil LaBute ensures that sensuality imbues scene after scene. Set against the unusual locations of Lincoln and Whiteby, the modern-day academics retrace the steps of the two poets both physically and romantically in cross-cutting scenes that reminded me of the structure of The French Lieutenant's Woman. If you're a pubescent popcorn-guzzler, you'll hate this movie and find it terribly slow and literary (it is based on the Booker Prize-winning novel by A S Byatt); on the other hand, if you'd like something different from the usual mindless, blockbuster fare, you'll probably find this a refreshing change.

Eckhart plays an American literary researcher in England who stumbles upon some long lost and completely unknown love letters by a Victorian poet (who just happens to be having his centenary celebrated!)  He pairs with an icy doctoral researcher (Paltrow) and they begin to piece together a heretofore undiscovered relationship between the married poet (Northam) and a fellow poetess (Ehle) who is involved in a long-standing lesbian love affair.  The stories are presented in turns, often accented by some clever setups in which the same settings reveal jumps in time.  Eckhart (an immensely appealing actor) took a lot of heat for his role which was originally intended for a British actor.  His presence changes the entire flavor of the story as it was written in the source novel, yet he comes across as endearing as ever. Paltrow (an agonizingly overrated actress and overrated beauty) looks like Carolyn Bessette Kennedy only with a rigid, showy English accent.  Her attention to the accent and to what she believes her character to be results in an almost robotic portrayal and nothing resembling a human being.  The Victorian couple generates both interest and romance, yet isn't given the screen time of the contemporary couple.  If a STAR hadn't been placed in the modern story, maybe the focus could have been more even and the Victorian story could have been given a  touch more emphasis.  Still, Northam and Ehle (who bears a striking resemblance to Meryl Streep) manage to make an impact. What was apparently quite enthralling and romantic on the page has become rather routine and familiar on the screen, though there are some lovely and thoughtful moments throughout.  Some of the location scenery is gorgeous (as is Eckhart.)  A host of British character actors round out the cast with results ranging from strong (Headey, Stephens) to campy (Eve) to wasted (Aird, Massey.)  Someone needs to inform Paltrow that an accent, a bun and a turtleneck don't provide the performance alone.  Some commitment, expression, thoughtfulness and especially realism are also in order!

Mostly the results are mediocre or even abysmal (Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure it was nothing of the kind).  One of my old and rarely seen favorites is The Yellow Rolls-Royce.More recently The Red Violin, based on Ann Rice's novel, took viewers through several epochs as the impending auction of a magnificent violin loomed.  That movie worked.  And so does Possession, also based on a novel and beautifully realized by  Neil LaBute,  a sensitive director with an outstanding leading cast.Set in England with a side trip to France, Possession follows the path of laconic American scholar Roland Mitchell (Aaron Eckhardt) as he works for an eccentric Irish academic.  Both specialize in nineteenth century British literature.  Apparently Mitchell is still working on his Ph.D - his duties for his employer are largely of a research assistant nature.At his master's command he goes to the British Museum to verify some data about the great poet, Randolph Henry Ash (come to life through Jeremy Northam).  Like Professor Peter Schickele, whose fortuitous discoveries of the works of Bach's least known son, P.D.Q., Mitchell stumbles upon several handwritten pages that lead him to believe that a great mystery about the life of Ash might be solvable.  Since Ash is being celebrated with exhibitions and academic convocations, this is, certainly, a good time for this Yank to delve into Ash's past.With the pages in hand (felony larceny comes to mind as the proper acquisition designation) the adventure begins.  And soon leads to Dr. Maud Bailey played by a luminous Gwyneth Paltrow (Ms. Paltrow is now living in London so her dialect preparation was practical as well as necessary for the film).Bailey is a specialist on the life of poet Christabel LaMotte (Jennifer Ehle). She's reputed to be a tough and difficult person.   Often in the academic world, that simply means the person in question is a competent woman.  As Bailey and Mitchell deepen their investigation the inevitable but well-acted romantic attraction, rejection, and...well... (you can guess, can't you?) rolls to its certain ending.The scenes shift seamlessly between the nineteenth century poets and the twenty-first century academic sleuths.  Career opportunities, acclaim, lionization by a small coterie of academics in very narrow fields await those who first publish new discoveries.  In a real world where many consider weaponizing pathogens to be the true meaningful work of the academy, it's nice to see that a love of literature and an insatiable desire to learn about those whose writings remain cherished can be the focus of a fine film.Of course there are scurrilous academics afoot - an arrogant American and his toady English assistant - who are sniffing at the trail left by Mitchell and Bailey.  The extremes they go to are silly, even funny but NOT implausible.  What is very silly are the recurrent anti-American comments that go beyond humor and make me wonder what the script writer's experiences here have been.Maud and Roland  seem real, and so are Christabel and Henry, because their doubts and passions aren't of the exaggerated variety that Masterpiece Theater regularly plucks from English literature or that Merchant/Ivory immortalizes.  Each couple in real life would understand the lives and fears of their opposite pairing.I'm not quite sure why the song Posseso accompanies the end credits. In any event I don't understand Italian beyond menu and cookbook so I have little idea what it's about.9/10.

Possession is a romance with no surprises since the first meeting between Maud Bailey (the beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow) and Roland Michel (Aaron Eckhart), the romance between them is very predictable. Roland Michel, an American living and working in London, finds some original documents that present a possible evidence that a married and faithful poet of the eighteenth century might have fallen in love with a lesbian poetess. Due to his research, he is introduced to Doctor Maud Bailey and as far as they go deeper and deeper in their research, they fall in love to each other. Their love increases in parallel to their findings about the passion between the poet and the poetess. The problem is not that the film is a bad movie, but being a Neil Labute's one, we would expect much more than that. I believe that other fans of Neil Labute will be also disappointed with this plot.

I really did try hard to like the movie on its own merits, even though the first five minutes gave me a solid clue as to exactly how far it was going to stray from the book, but I just couldn't.  I couldn't even finish watching it.  Aaron Eckhart, look, I'm sorry, I'm sure he's a great guy, but he was just awful in this (it doesn't help that his character wasn't supposed to be an American).  Gweneth Paltrow was doing OK as far as I watched her, although I am a little tired of hearing her put on an English accent -- I say this even though I loved Sliding Doors and especially Shakespeare in Love.  (Seeing two Americans in the leads of what is a VERY British novel didn't please me much to begin with).  I know that people get very tired of movie reviews which constantly compare the movie to the book, but this movie was such a pitiful, hollow shell compared to the rich and fascinating novel on which it was based that I just can't help it. Every iota of atmosphere and romance were sucked out completely and all that was left was a big empty space -- which was short a few key characters and a LOT of scholarly interest.  I was even quite disappointed in Jennifer Ehle, whom I loved in Pride and Prejudice.

Byatt's Possession, the girlfriend & I were looking forward to watching the DVD.Unfortunately, someone (presumably director Neil LaBute) decided that it would make a better movie if Roland were recast as (this is how he put it in the fragment of director's comments that I glanced at) a brash American...to give the movie more 'spark'.That's like casting Pee Wee Herman in the lead role of Conan the Barbarian (we thought his manic antics would lend new energy to the role).Aaron Eckhart mugs and smirks his way through the whole movie, apparently under the impression that he's Harrison Ford in a remake of Star Wars and Professor Maud Baily is spoiled Princess Leia.  Or perhaps Humphrey Bogart to her Hepburn in an English-lit African Queen.What a pathetic waste of an opportunity.  The book was, if not unreservedly great, entirely fresh and entertaining.  There was plenty of spark between Roland Michell, -- the research assistant so immersed in Randolph Ash, and subsequently in the romance between Ash and Cristabel LaMotte, and so tentative about asserting his own self -- and Bailey, the established professor ensconced in a literary and gender studies post and formidably arrayed in poststructuralist feminist semiotics.  First Roland and then Maud are swept up in the romance of Ash and LaMotte's liaisons, and it brings the former out of the shadows of his studies and the latter out from behind the protections of her analyses.  Roland does not crack the shell of an ivory-tower Maud with a stiff back and a crisp demeanor with his raunchy worldliness --that's somebody else's story.  Maud comes out, lured into a less safe and more vulnerable position, by the intoxication of passion and possibility, and precisely because Roland is not abrasive and full of himself and inclined to be a threat in her space, as his colleage and her former lover, Fergus Wolff, had been.  And Roland comes out, himself, daring to express, to reach out, lured by the fascinating combination of Maud's carefully maintained self-sufficiency and the possibility of touching her nevertheless.The movie, on the other hand... well, it's not entirely a bad story, I suppose, it's just so totally not the same story.  Nor is it anywhere near as interesting, as stories of its ilk (brash male whatever gets to and loosens up crisp and somewhat uptight female whatever) have been done so many times before, and better.

So many compromises have been made to get this richly textured novel onto the screen that where the book interwove the stories in a fascinating counterpoint, convincing in voice and detail, the film is simply a bog-standard romance between good-looking actors with some pretty victorian stuff tacked on.You have wonder about the wisdom of even attempting to convert a book which is powerful tribute to the power of words and language and turning into a would-be powerful tribute to Gwyneth Paltrow.  To paraphrase the famous quote, making a movie about words and language is something like a dancing about architecture.The second largest flaw is that Aaron Eckhart is woefully miscast, leaving a character floundering in a story where he no longer makes any sense.  I'm not sure if he normally delivers his lines in such a clunkingly flat way, but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.  I'm not against adding American elements to a story to make it work commercial - it worked very well in High Fidelity, for example, but Roland's transatlantic transposition leaves all the other characters constantly having to react to his incongruous American-ness - he simply doesn't fit into the character in the novel.In addition, several *important* characters have been removed, leaving gaps in the narrative - obvious ones - Roland's previous girlfriend for example. Roland explains his singledom as he is simply off relationships, but never gives any kind of convincing back story to the motivation for this. Strange gaps like this make the main characters seem one-dimensional and adrift in a plot that has to rattle through events which are barely explained by what we see on the screen.I have to admit, I was bored rigid and couldn't wait for the film to finish. I can't see how anyone could take much out of such an obviously compromised film, unless they're a Merchant-Ivory fanatic and love any old nonsense with Victorian frills.

Now Roland, along with another expert, Dr. Maude Bailey (Gwyneth Paltrow) are on their trail. Along the way, they are developing a romance between themselves.Posession does more things wrong than it does right. The biggest problem is the underlying story. I haven't read the novel by A.S. Byatt, but judging by the film, there isn't much story to begin with, certainly not enough for a 102 minute film (and it's not especially interesting). Either that, or the screenplay is worse than it already is. Plot holes abound, subplots are started and left unfinished, and more importantly, there's no balance between the dual tales.The performances by the actors don't help much. Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart are the biggest names in the cast, but unfortunately they're the ones we have to spend the most time with. Both are good actors (Paltrow won an Oscar, though undeservedly, and judging by Eckhart's climb to fame and versatility, it's only a matter of time before he gets a statue), but they have no chemistry. At least Eckhart, a Neil LaBute regular, makes a game try. That's more than can be said for his co-star, Gwyneth Paltrow. I've never been a big fan of Paltrow; she's always a little whiny and seems off. She can muster a decent British accent, but that's only the surface. As Maude, she's pretty boring, and for someone whose sudden romance is the unofficial beating heart of the film, she has no chemistry with Eckhart. The 1850's lovers, Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle, aren't exactly better, but they have chemistry, which makes them more appealing.The film isn't a total loss; it looks great, and I always have a special place in my heart for historical mysteries (even poorly done ones).

There are so many laughable plot turns that I'm not sure if this screenplay was even proofread by someone with any distance.  The catalyst for the film's intrigue, a couple of stolen letters that one of our protagonists pilfers from a rare books library, is only the first of many weak moments that in the transition from text to screen lose any plausibility.  Someone should have bothered to go into a manuscript and rare book archive to see what stealing from one of these institutions would really be like.I'm actually quite a fan of A.S. Byatt, whose novel is the original source material for this drivel.  Possession as a novel is fun, but seriously flawed--When transferred to the screen by an underwhelming cast and crew, though, those flaws become insurmountable obstacles.  Any subtleties in the novel's juxtaposition of the two relationships disappear, replaced by the lumbering cliches that permeate the dialogue.David Henry Hwang is a fine writer for the stage, but forays into film have more often than not proven that he has not quite mastered the celluloid--it just isn't his medium.  Rather than transferring the novel's richness to the screen, he has attached himself religiously to it's rickety frame, certainly not its most successful characteristic. Gwyneth Paltrow's British accent is, as usual, just shy of being believable. Both Paltrow's Maude and Aaron Eckhart's Roland are barely cardboard cutouts rather than characters, and the actors do little to flesh them out. Poor Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle, two fine actors, are squandered in the Victorian scenes where they barely have enough material to establish mood.As for the representation of academic life, it's more than a little absurd, which is actually fine with me since academic life is even more absurd than this film could hope to capture.Overall, I was terribly disappointed, since I was hoping this would be good candy for the academic set.

Set in the present with flashbacks to the 19th century, the film is about two literary experts with a love of Victorian poetry who discover a shocking secret about a revered 19th century poet. The period portion of the film is excellent, mainly due to some uncharacteristically good directing by LaBute and excellent acting by Jennifer Ehle and the always great Jeremy Northham (if there was any justice this guy would be a major star).Sadly the modern day characters are not played by actors of such caliber. Gwyneth Paltrow I suppose should be given credit for being occasionally OK, but Neil LaBute cohort Aaron Eckhart was a positively disastrous choice to play the lead. He clearly had no insight into a character who is supposed to be this sophisticated, and instead played him as a stereotypically cartoonish American male slob who inexplicably loves English poetry (and is a scholar to boot!) Add in some truly bad writing, dialogue and a screenplay that suffers from logic gaps and you've got a frustrating movie that might have been good but ultimately isn't.

The film intercuts modern-day scenes of Eckhart and Paltrow falling cautiously in love with flashbacks to the two poets, played by Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle. I found this literal and conventional approach to be the film's biggest failing, and couldn't help but think how much more interesting the film might have been if we had never seen actual reconstructions of the past and were left to visualize it along with the two scholars.

Eckhart is an extremely likable actor, and Paltrow is well cast, if a bit too conventionally beautiful for the role, and the two have quite a bit of chemistry.

Eckhart is effective in his role although I do understand some people's ire that his character was made into an American. If the intent was to convey that he was an outsider who goes against convention and dares to think of things differently, then I think he was still effective and convincing.  Presenting him a foreigner would only reinforce this intention.  Paltrow is not bad in her role but I think this is where there is an argument that an actual British actress would have been more effective (i.e. someone like Kate Beckinsale, Rachel Weisz, Catherine Keener, or Emily Mortimer who all have the distinction of having attended prestigious British universities like Oxford and Cambridge) in making the character more complex so we could truly understand the psychology of an ice cold British, female academic.  Besides having a British accent which Paltrow seems to do well, the part required an understanding of the woman's psyche that I'm not sure I fully understood. Despite being an American from Texas, Renee Zellweger did this well in Bridget Jones' Diary, although her accent was a bit posh for the character.

He enlists the help of Maud Bailey (Paltrow), a fellow scholar that specializes in the works of Christobel LaMotte (Ehle), the woman Mitchell suspects of being the secret lover.  The film shows the parallel stories of the 20th century investigators and the 19th century lovers, and how the two relationships change as time passes.Firstly, the good Northam and Ehle are fabulous.  Their characterizations and commitment do more to convince the audience they have gone back in time than the camera tricks or the voice-overs.  Both actors are totally compelling and make their scenes shine a little brighter than the rest of the film.  The story is intriguing, and the camera work is clean and sharp, realizing each scene without overshadowing the acting with trickery.On the less good side it felt to me as though the modern story fell flat.  Eckhart is a good actor, but in this film he's like a 1956 Cadillac El Dorado, coughing and sputtering out in the beginning, but eventually turning into a smooth ride.  Paltrow isn't called on to do anything the audience hasn't seen her do before, which isn't to say that she's bad she's good, but it's nothing new.  And the story suffers a little in the modern scenes as well; the dialogue falls apart during the romantic scenes, and the chemistry is hit-and-miss.

He is working as an assistant to a literary professor and specializes in the work of Randolph Henry Ash, a 19th century poet known for his single-minded devotion to his wife. At the start of the film Roland is going through old books at the British Museum when he finds a letter between the pages. He brashly decides to borrow the letter, which seems to be a love letter from Ash to a woman who is *not* his wife.The letter is written to Christabel LaMotte, another 19th century poet. The best expert on LaMotte is Maud Bailey (Gwyneth Paltrow), so Roland goes to see her. At first she dismisses his suggestion that Ash and LaMotte had ever even met, much less carried on any sort of affair. But Roland and Maude dig further, finding out far more about these two long dead people than they ever expected.As this mystery and investigation is going on in the present day, the movie begins to flash back to the 19th century story. We see Ash (Jeremy Northam) meet LaMotte (Jennifer Ehle, who visually reminded me a bit of Meryl Streep at times) at a party, and we see them develop a relationship through letters written back and forth. There is more, but I don't want to give away too much.If you've heard anything about this film, you know that Roland and Maude also develop a relationship. But the construction of the two romances is far less parallel than I would have expected. Ash and LaMotte are immediately drawn to one another, but have serious social forces keeping them apart. Roland and Maude, on the other hand, have only their own internal issues keeping them apart. I don't think this was as clear to me as I watched the film as it is now, and it seems to add something to my appreciation of the film's structure.The aspect of the film which bothered me a bit was the ease with which the modern couple solves the series of mysteries that they are confronted with. I can only think of one case where they initially guess wrong, and the certainty with which they move forward makes it seem as if they are also seeing the flashbacks to the 19th century that the film's audience is seeing, which confirm each of the steps along the way. On the positive side, the fast progression of the mystery kept the film from feeling as slow as I initially feared it might be.In the film's favor is the cinematography, which captures England both present and past beautifully. The acting is fine but not memorable, perhaps because the characters seem to think more than they feel.All in all, this film is a good romance that is well worth seeing.Seen on 9/8/2002.

The intercutting of the Victorian and Modern scenes is flawless and is, again, a higher level of accomplishment. The parallel romances, separated by 100 years, convincingly posit a set of questions about the nature of love. Were the Victorians more responsive to an external morality while the Moderns are informed by their own internal examinations? Is love constant through the ages or is it overwhelmed by circumstances? There are two mysteries in this movie and this is more compelling than the search for the hidden letters. The stereotypes were meant to convey by symbols a greater sweep of character; they were masterfully done, particularly the French girl who could not possibly condescend to speak English, an all too common event. In these symbols, of course, lies the droll comedy that emerges at every turn. How the American is treated is NOT anti-american but a fairly accurate representation of the attitude of Europeans generally. It is not an attitude of disdain but of bemusement and suffering tolerance.  Upon seeing the movie the second time, I could easily see how the American might be considered boorish.

And yet, somehow, stubborn, slimy, porcinely cackling at every gobbet of invective hurled his way (how would I know I was a genius if they didn't?), Neil LaBute...*hangs on,* affirming and reaffirming to the indie world that he tells Bitter Truths, that he makes the audience Squirm in a Way That Is Healthy, that he is the rack-tightening Savanorola of our twenty-first-century psychosexual catecombs. LaBute's one semi-successful picture, YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS, succeeds in unexpectedly humanizing the previously sticklike uncharacters who populate laBute's misandric screeds. (Catherine Keener's coolly imperious sex-queen, never able to make the world quiet enough during her coitus, is one of the nineties' few indelible movie characters.) But oy! the rest? Peel aside LaBute's cremaster-crunching impersonations of British theatre's 1970s shock jocks--the Howard Brentons of yesteryear-- and you have a director with as much talent as your average MURDER SHE WROTE hack. If memory steers you in another direction, look back on the two pictures LaBute directed but whose scripts he did not originate NURSE BETTY and POSSESSION--as sorrily schizoid a double bill as our American movies can proffer.Both BETTY and POSSESSION make feints at evolving beyond the calculated snark that is LaBute's stock in trade. NURSE BETTY seems to want to be an aren't-you-just-darling? sugar-and-spice fest in the manner of a slightly treacly Sandra Bullock movie, but LaBute's sweet tooth for verfremdungsefekt gets the better of him. (Neil Simon movie music + squirt-in-the-eye blood squibs--ca ne marche pas.) And in POSSESSION, LaBute takes A.S. Byatt's upper-middlebrow English-major romance--in which two contemporary scholars track down a forbidden love between a famous nineteenth-century poet and a famous, married feminist-- and dunks it in the gamy, stale-shirt odor of his Dirty Rotten Truth.Roland, the male of the contemporary duo, is played by Aaron Eckhart, who describes himself, with consummate, dated LaButean inanity, as kind of a brush-n-flush kind a guy, and generally behaves around his opposite number, an icy British academician (Gwyneth Paltrow) like a community-college tight end bumping into Susan Sontag's bookshelves. Paltrow is hemmed in for sure by LaBute's airtight conception. She spends the entire movie with her hair in an anal-repressive bun so tight that it is eventually commented on. (Gwyneth's sexual liberation is a Seventies Clairol Moment.) But when she has something meaty to play--a confession of her helpless uptightness, a reach toward another that quickly shrivels into shame and hate--we are reminded that, yes, Gwyneth Paltrow is the strongest woman actor of her generation. (I will defend that against all comers.) And we are reminded that Aaron Eckhart has acted in all of Neil LaBute's movies--and Eckhart, having been LaBute's steadfast supporter way back in their persecuted days at Brigham Young, is now getting payday from a buddy. He gets the Billy Crudup part! I never thought I'd appreciate how good Crudup really is till now.Eckhart, so fuzzily likable in ERIN BROCKOVICH, doesn't seem to have a lot of resources. His pudgy fuddy-dud in FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS was also a standout, probably because the character's acid-reflux introversion felt like a big reach for him. But when he's supposed to be Mr. Bedhead and Shiny Teeth, he looks like a soap star who got off on the wrong floor. He'd wreck the movie. If LaBute hadn't wrecked it already.Like the little fattie in THE PICKWICK PAPERS who says, I wants to make your flesh crawl, LaBute is never happier than when sticking poo-poo in the punch bowl. During some expository scenes in Eckhart's boss' office in a university, LaBute sets up an attraction between Eckhart and the boss' secretary--a cute, shy young thing who never gets up from her desk. Later, when Eckhart's evil rival tells the boss about Eckhart's misadventures with Paltrow, the rival makes sure the secretary can hear--so we can see her sad, crestfallen face when she realizes that Eckhart has found another love. Why? Does this contribute anything to the story or the thematics of the picture--except LaBute's endlessly reiterated non-idea, which he finally has Paltrow speak outright in this movie What's the point of connection when all men and women seem to do is rip each other apart? CARNAL KNOWLEDGE, one of the Rosetta stones of LaBute's dyspeptic canon, was not just throwing up its hands over the status of men and women--it suggested very tangible responsibilities, particularly on the part of the endlessly, cozily self-deceptive guys. In LaBute's world, we're meant to grin at the awfulness of it all--and then sigh, Well, what can you do! It's been like that since the world began. One suspects that LaBute considers this to be the sexualized version of Stanley Kubrick's civilization-as-murder worldview. The difference is that Kubrick made his points carefully, un-obviously, and with a good deal of regret. LaBute is a wallower. A friend put it best In a Todd Solondz movie, it's clear that Solondz wishes what happened were not so; in a LaBute movie, he clearly does wish it were so, and is glad that it is.Aside from the unnecessary carcinogens LaBute brings to the otherwise compelling dual structure of Byatt's novel, the director really has nothing much to offer. His skill with staging and the camera are no better than a middling television hack's. He is a huckster who clicked in--and we can only hope that his latest taboo-busting theatre works about 9-11 may keep him from darkening the doors of our cinemas any time soon.

Also, I've only seen 2 of Mr. LeBute's previous movies - Nurse Betty, which I thought was okay, and Your Friends and Neighbors, which I did not think was okay - so I was surprised when I was enchanted by this movie.  (Perhaps I need to give his other movies another look.)  Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart were beautiful to look at and enjoyable to listen to, and made the impossible task of reading letters on screen seem easy - and interesting.  And I'd watch anything Jeremy Notham is in at least once, and some I've watched a good many times more than once. But, in the final analysis, the movie belongs to Jennifer Ehle, whom I'd never seen before.  An amazing performance in an amazing part.

That film had all sorts of complex abstractions the woman, convinced she was a character, trying out for the role by pretending she is pretending. Very clever. Very sophisticated in terms of narrative underpinning. And we had the book, which ties the two periods together with poetry as the target of a mystery. So I was expecting some wonderful merger of narrative poetry, folded time and unraveling truth through discovery. I had in my mind, the template of the similarly targeted `French Lieutenant's Woman' which had the same structure but with acting (!) in the place of writing. This would be better because the language was so lush in the book.And in `Duets' I thought I saw Ms. Paltrow actually achieve that multidimensional acting where one plays a character and simultaneously comments on it.Alas, this is rather a hash. Pulling off this sort of thing requires a rough parity between the two worlds, lest one be merely a frame to the other. And that's what happens here the modern world is uninteresting. The mystery is supposed to balance the poetry, but the mystery is lame -- on the level of the clunking `Kate and Leopold.' That the mystery wasn't so conceived is denoted by the inclusion of the iconic Anne Massey. The casting doesn't help the modern story Gwyneth as a scholar? Gwyneth as sleuth?Obviously, the studio cut a lot out of the modern story the part about the lawyer and Indian girlfriend goes nowhere. The setup of the bespectacled secretary having a crush is lost. The business about the competing scholar/collector was too weak to have been conceived that way.The other requirement is to form a link between the two worlds. `Dead Again,' `French,' even the otherwise forgettable `Misadventures of Margaret' do this well. It seems not difficult. But look at the transitions here clumsy. They ask a lot of forgiveness from the viewer.

A literary adaptation of A S Byatt's novel. A story of of two love affairs some 100 years apart that also serves as an academic detective story, academic skulduggery and romance in academia.The relationship in two time streams and the mirroring of it suggests to me the 1981 movie adaptation of The French Lieutenants Woman. However Possession has kind of ripped the guts out of the novel so the mirroring is not as evident.Roland Mitchell (Aaron Eckhart) is a brash American scholar in London studying the works of English poet Randolph Henry Ash (Jeremy Northam) whose poetry was devoted to his wife.Maud Bailey (Gwyneth Paltrow) is an English academic researching the life of a lesser known Victorian poet Christabel LaMotte (Jennifer Ehle) who was also bisexual.Mitchell has discovered letters that appear to link both poets as secret lovers and therefore put a twist to what is known about Ash and his devotion to his wife that would create a literary scandal. The film shows us flashbacks of the two poets lives together and with their partners and the repercussion it causes.Both Mitchell and Bailey follow the trail of clues across England and France visiting libraries, caves and tombs and both also romantically fall for each other as they visit the same places where romance between the poets burned, even though Bailey is going out with another academic researcher (Toby Stephens) who also works as a scholar for the same professor as Mitchell. He gets wind of what they are up to and courts a rival professor to get in on the act and usurp them.We find that the romance between the poets in the Victorian era was more passionate and daring than their modern counterparts who seem afraid to commit. The poets fell in love with each other because of their love letters and poetry. It celebrates writing. The film starts out brightly as Mitchell navigates life in London and being a downtrodden research underling. The film does gets fusty as we are introduced to the flashbacks which is more Quality Street in its confection when it needed bite and spice.The underhanded tactics of rival academics does not work because all of them are just a bunch of farts and you care little for them.I expected something less conventional from LaBute, something more spiky and barbed given that there is a daring and scandalous relationship in Victorian England. The modern day setting is very subdued. It was nice of Labute to show the professors up as a bunch of jackasses though.

Paltrow pulls off a sympathetic performance as a woman bent on solving a mystery of love yet finding it herself. She plays off her role with intelligence and wit while Echhart is effective as the determined student joining her in the mystery. One benefit is that Paltrow and Eckhart are not involved in a dimwitted rom com. Jeremy Northam, and Jennifer Ehle are superb in Victorian roles whose story effectively parallels the other but in a more tragic sense. Other roles are placed too far in the background to matter.

It might have been better if we'd seen more of Ash and LaMotte, the Victorian poets (especially as embodied by the radiant Jennifer Ehle), but this standoffish, screwed-up, commitment-shy pair are clearly LaBute's kind of people. The script gets a little goofy at about the halfway mark, but that's really Byatt's fault, IMHO. On the very first page, she warns the reader, via an epigraph from Hawthorne, that the writer of a romance can get away with stuff (paraphrasing here) that a regular novelist can't. After the trail goes cold, she summons up two huge honking coincidences to keep our young scholars on the case. In the novel a goddess ex machina&#x97;specifically an American lesbian cultural-studies prof&#x97;turns up with a crucial journal, and in the film you have to be paying pretty close attention to figure out why they're in France all of a sudden; later on, Eckhart's character just happens to overhear the baddies plotting their next move. Despite a few rough patches like this, I'd still recommend the film to fans of the novel; not sure what others will make of it. Great care was obviously taken with every aspect of the production; nice to see a younger, brunette Lena Headey, of Game of Thrones fame, as LaMotte's other lover.

Byatt novel of the same name, follows two interweaving love stories. Taking place more than a century apart, both romances rotate around a love for literature, a love which is designed to echo both our and LaBute's love for prose, but which doesn't quite work on screen. LaBute's not strong enough a visualist, and much of his film simply consists of dry letter reading and dull narration.The film's present day romance stars Aaron Eckhart and Gwyneth Paltrow. He's an American scholar in London on a fellowship to study celebrated Victorian poet Randolph Ash, she's a professor researching the life of Ash's suspected lover, another Victorian poet named Christabel LaMotte. In an attempt to get to some historical truth, Eckhart and Paltrow track down poems, letters and correspondences between these two Victorians, and of course become romantically engaged as they do so.Though more flowery than LaBute's other films, Possession never strays far from LaButian cynicism. For most of its running time love is portrayed as being inherently possessive, an act of acquisition, rife with double-speak, deception and mad longings. Our characters in the present &#x96; both cold, stuffy academics &#x96; themselves maintain a modern scepticism toward romance. Eventually, however, the film becomes perhaps the most optimistic of LaBute's relationship films; social mores, constrictions and preconceptions come falling down, there remains the hint or hope of something more and our heroes themselves seem to learn about a way of loving that has been lost to their (post-)modern selves.It's immensely difficult to make a film about literary detectives. Polanski did well with The Ghost Writer and The Ninth Gate, but he's an old hand with a camera. LaBute's less sure of himself, and seems to think orally (or with prose?) rather than visually. Much of his film consists of unintentionally funny shots of rolling British countrysides and po-faced letter reading. Bizarrely, LaBute also opts to change the nationality of Eckhart's character. This destroys an entire subplot from Byatt's novel, which painted the dying of a literary/academic class and portrayed a wealthy man's possessive and obsessive postimperial, neocolonial mission to appropriate the past &#x96; to shut it down and forbid others from delving into it &#x96; and seal it instead into antiseptic, air-conditioned multi-media storage rooms. LaBute's film is less political, and perhaps less depressing.LaBute often gets compared to David Mamet. In this regard Posession most resembles Mamet's Oleanna, another film about professors, possessiveness and the power of language.6/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

The main question was whether we own/possess the ones we love?. Also, the point that Roland started his research by keeping letters that were not in his possession... And...the letters should belong to the senders or their receivers?

There's a Merchant/Ivory feel to the whole film, tasteful in every way as far as settings, costumes and performances are concerned. Credit for that must go to Neil LaBute who has done a skillful job of creating past and present in a way that is fluid rather than jarring, going easily from the 21st Century to 19th with camera movements that blend them together seamlessly. JEREMY NORTHAM and JENNIFER EHLE are impressive as Victorian lovers caught up in an illicit relationship.Paltrow is more appealing than usual even though her role is rather one dimensional and Eckhart is appealing as the American doing his earnest research believably. The trouble is that neither the present nor the past has a particularly fascinating story to tell and this is especially apparent after more than two hours have passed without any resolution to the tale.A fanciful tale for admirers of Victorian romance, its appeal is limited to a certain spectrum of the audience looking for a tale that explores relationships.

Trevor Eve and Toby Stephens. Regrettably, Stephens' potentially very interesting part as a villain, though starting well, ultimately is small and towards the end more or less forgotten. Eve similarly. Northam playing the Victorian poet would be expected to have a major amount of screen time along with his beloved, but this doesn't happen. The director concentrates on the most boring characters in the book, the two dreary modern characters plugging away interminably at their research and sparring with each other until one hardly cares what they find out or what they feel about one another as they simply aren't exciting characters.I think my reaction clearly indicates this movie isn't as good as it could have been. A good movie should hold the attention even if not featuring all that much the actors you came to it for. So who's at fault - the story, the actors playing the modern researchers, or the director? I think the director. He had the opportunity to make a better adaptation of the book or to divide attention more fairly between the characters, and chose not to.But of course it depends on your point of view.

The story of the Victorian lovers is so much better told than the present day one of the couple trying to uncover the long-kept secret of Maud's distant ancestor. I think it would have been better if Maud and Roland's story had been dropped all together, and we'd been given a more complete story about Christabel and Randolph. Of course, I haven't read the book, so I don't know just how important the modern story is to the readers in this film, but I think the screenplay, acting and direction in the period piece is just more intriguing and much, much better done.I listened to a bit of the director's commentary, and he mentioned taking a screenwriter's license to changing the original story so it would work the way he wanted it to, which I think is a shame, because I have heard the book is such a good read. Perhaps letting Roland remain British instead of making him American would also have been better. After all, I understand the British class system is partly what the book was about. Did many realize that Christabel's lesbian lover Blanche was from a lower class than her? I noticed the class accent difference.I'm sure there are many women who saw the film who wouldn't mind being whisked away for a weekend in Whitby by Aaron Eckhart's Roland, but personally I'd rather find Jeremy Northam's Randolph Ash waiting outside my apartment door!

They seem colourless, wooden, and uninterested. And their characters are not terribly interesting either. The revelation of the familial connection comes out as dead and damp as the box retrieved from the grave.Interestingly, I had a similar reaction to this as to The Hours, whereby I found the flashbacks to the past far more real, fascinating, and alive than the scenes set in the present. A bias on the part of the directors or me, I'm not sure, but in both cases, I feel the films had great potential as true period pieces, but fell flat in their awkward efforts to overlay the two (three in the case of the Hours) time-periods. The lead actors, the true stars, SHOULD be Northam and Ehle (who is remarkably beautiful in this film). I'm still astounded by the attention Paltrow receives for very bland acting (compare her award-winning performance in Shakespeare In Love, for example, to Blanchett's remarkable performance the same year in Elizabeth).By the way, I did also read the novel, and found it more entertaining, but not by much.

It was disappointing that Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart were cast in place of Brits, who would have been more convincing as academics working in the Literature field. Both those actors are good in their place, but this wasn't the best place for them, in my opinion. Trevor Eve is very good usually but came across as a comedy fake American villain, doubled with Toby Stephens as his partner in crime. Tom Hollander was lovely in a small role and he often seems to pop up in films with Jeremy Northam (Enigma, Gosford Park), which is interesting.

The acting of Ehle and especially Northram is excellent. Northram proves once again to be magnificent at period roles.However, the modern romance portrayed by Palthrow and Eckhart is not well acted. The relationship seems hollow and doesn't make sense. And there is no real chemistry between the two. In my opinion this romance would have been a lot better if two Brit actors had been cast.All in all Possession is a good way to spend a rainy afternoon or evening. I'd recommend it to people who like romantic dramas and lovely sets, not really caring if the story is a bit thin.This movie has at least inspired me to go and by the book!Hope it will do the same to you!

It wasn't a best seller for nothing.  It's always very hard to turn a book into a movie, but in this case there were major alterations, particularly in casting and in the omission of characters, that significantly change the mood and the motivations of the protagonists. The alterations made in the dialog to accommodate these changes gloss over the details that the meat of the story clings to.  Aaron Eckhart can never do justice to Roland simply because he is American.  What makes what Roland does so extraordinary is the fact that he is British and a mediocre academic. Byatt's book is so rich in detail that any filmmaker should find it a clear roadmap - instead, Lebute deviates from the path and one of the most artful, complex, and moving books I've read becomes a exercise in making a ten hour story fit within a two- hour window.

Mild Spoilers Ahead!**Although love is a primary theme in this movie, Possession is too smart to be labeled as a 'chick flick.'  The romance occurs differently than in most movies.  Rather than simply meet, click, and fall in love, the lead characters (Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart) become interested in each other through their collaboration on an historic literary mystery.  The events around them bring the love to them, through exploration and information.  Yes, they still jump into bed a little too quickly, but the pace of the relationship seemed more reasonable than normal. The mystery portion of the film is also unusual.  Most viewers (like myself) won't know anything about the story, so everything that happens is legitimately fresh and new.  As Paltrow and Eckhart unravel the backstory, small twist after small twist is revealed, and these twists constantly maintain the interest of the audience.  One side story is unnecessary and forgettable, but it isn't overly emphasized and can be easily ignored.  Technically, the film is very good.  It looks great, whether in the vivid and lush countryside of England or the urban exteriors and interiors.  Even when using basic fall and winter hues, Possession feels alive with color.  The transitions between the parallel stories are efficient, effective, and enjoyable.  Often a mere pan of the camera covers hundreds of years, smoothly switching between romance stories.  Nothing is particularly ground-breaking, but director Neil LaBute uses established and little-used techniques perfectly.  The script is solid as well.  Although it does occasionally feel overly literary, that type of dialogue still works because of the style of the film.  Bottom Line  More than anything else, I found this movie interesting.  It intrigued me and kept my attention the whole time.  Three of four stars.

This time he surprises viewers with `Possession'  a personal and thought provoking film.Based on A.S. Byatt's novel. `Possession,' tells the story of two couples. One is Victorian and the other is contemporary. An American researcher, Roland Mitchell (played by Aaron Eckart,) follows the steps of the English poet Radolph Ash. Then he discovers some letters sent by Ash to a mysterious woman. In a coincidence another researcher, a young English woman named Maud Bailey (Gwyneth Paltrow) studies the work and life of another Victorian intellectual, `Christabel La Motte'. The two meet with each other, and they realize that the mysterious woman could be Christabel. Then they start an investigation that leads them to discover dramatic events involving illicit relations (the poet is married and his lover is a lesbian and feminist). They begin to get involved with each other while living the passion and the drama of the two characters.The story of the two couples of both epochs is universal and understandable. The viewer will find out that love, sex and what's not allowed remain the same, despite human progress in other areas. The ending is surprising as well as the whole movie.  I must stress that I haven't read the book `Possession,' but I've heard good things about it. Without reading the book, I risk to say that perhaps this movie was quite faithful to it, because the movie is nicely organized, so that's something that makes the movie more understandable. This is an original story, which is not too corny and requires a thoughtful viewer.The author of the screenplay, Laura Jones, does good dialogue.  She's written great screenplays like `the Portrait of a lady' and `The Well,' which was one of the reasons why I saw it. The scenery is very beautiful; we get to see England and a lot of amazing landscapes. The actors give believable and intellectually interesting performances.`Possession' is a movie, which you may like or hate. It depends on your taste. If you're into romantic, but not too corny movies, you'll probably like it, otherwise you won't.

The movie slips effortlessly from modern day to Victorian England as we revisit the poet, who is capable of far more passion than Paltrow or her reluctant suitor are capable even of imagining. There are lots of missed opportunities &#150; the connection with a strong past romance could have lit fires in the souls of those in the present day &#150; or the searching for truth could itself have been a bit more passionate and convincing, as we had, say, in A Brilliant Mind.

It almost seems like it's about to be, but then it pulls itself out of his usual dreary, humanity-loathing existence and becomes a very uplifting picture. Aaron Eckhart plays graduate student Roland Michell, researching the life of Randolph Henry Ash, a fictional 19th century poet played by Jeremy Northam. (Does Jeremy Northam ever play anything modern-day? He just looks like he belongs in period pieces. He's kind of like Helena Bonham-Carter, when she's not in ape makeup.) Michell discovers an unfinished letter to a mistress, who he discovers to be Christabel LaMotte (Jennifer Ehle). Maud Bailey (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a gender-studies professor who studies LaMotte. Got that? The film flashes back and forth between modern day and 1859, showing the stories of the lovers as they unfold. As Michell and Bailey uncover the details of Ash & LaMotte's affair, they fall in love themselves, despite poor dating histories and looming personality flaws. Oh, and there's an evil American professor trying to steal the story for his own museum. And LaMotte was a lesbian. Does it seem incongruous? Yeah, it is. And that's one of the problems with Possession. It has this serious romantic drama, and the flashbacks work fairly well, but it has these wild tonal shifts which distract you from the main point of the movie. It goes from a bodice-ripper to an Agatha Christie mystery to a Nick Hornby-type modern love story. It's a little distracting. LaBute is more famous for his scathing plays about how messed-up relationships are. 1997's In the Company of Men's main point was men are crap. 1998's Your Friends & Neighbors said marriage is crap. 2000's Showtime TV movie Bash Latterday Plays (starring Eckhart and a fantastic Calista Flockhart) told us Mormons are crap. 2000's Nurse Betty was his first foray into the less-than-cruel-spirited, and worked mainly on the strengths of his cast. Not to say that Possession's cast isn't strong. They handle the material they're given quite well. But the aforementioned tonal shifts tend to erode their credibility. It's quite an enjoyable movie, in these days of Fear.com and XXX. It's close to being excellent. But those little things detract from it. Overall, it's a good film.

But being a great lover of Northam and Ehle's work, and having a trusted fellow movie lover tell me recently, You will love this movie, I went.Not having read the book, I really had no expectations. I am convinced that this is the best way to see a film, because I found Possession to be one of the most intelligent, well made films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing.Much has been made of Aaron Eckhardt's boorishness and the lack of chemistry between he and Gwyneth Paltrow (who seems to suffer from an inordinate amount of backlash recently). I found, to the contrary, that their chemistry was real and palpable. Eckhardt's Roland reminded me of more than a few fellows I knew in my 20s - hardscrabble, practical,with a thick shell, but an incurable romantic at the core. The reviewer who didn't get why Roland was off women missed the exchange between he and Maude in Yorkshire, in which he made reference to a past romantic situation that was extremely painful for him. Roland's professed loner status was simply armor, and I thought Eckhardt did a fine job of letting that armor slip bit by bit, as he grew to care for Paltrow's Maude.  The dialogue between Roland and Maude was realistic to me, and you can sense the frustration each had with not having been born in the simpler time of their idols, the Victorian poets. Aren't we modern, comments Maude wryly to Roland, but you can see she wishes they weren't.The segue between past and present was seamless, although I think the movie might have done well with more of each - another 10-15 minutes or so total running time might have really fleshed out the characters of the two Victorian poets, in particular.My only quibble was that the movie didn't end with one last view of the modern day couple, to bring us back to the present. But the ending scene was touching, nevertheless.Don't go to this film expecting a cinematic translation of a book, and be willing to go where the characters take you. You will be pleasantly surprised and rewarded with a lyrical, intelligent movie that isn't afraid to tackle the ugly side of intellectualism head on, and doesn't shy away from cultural realities (yes, upper class British people really do view us as somewhat barbaric, believe me), but does it in a wry, humorous and even affectionate way.I will happily wait for this one to come out on DVD.

Since I am no heavyweight in the fields of poetry or literature - and they have been weighing in suggesting a similar lack of depth in both films - don't look for insightful analysis in these comments. These are merely my own musings.In the story of  Possession, we meet Randolph Henry Ash (Jeremy Northam) who is a celebrated 19th century poet and heralded misogynist. His relation with his wife, though loving, lacks physical satisfaction. He meets the celebrated poet Christabel LaMotte (Jennifer Ehle) in whom he finds his Muse and love interest. Ash's overtures are rebuffed initially resulting in - what else - more passionate poetry. Well, at least he has found his Muse.Leap ahead to the 21st century where Roland Michell (Aaron Eckhart), an American grad student in Britain uncovers some long-hidden drafts of letters written by Ash to an unnamed interest.  Clues to this puzzle are found in the romantic verse of these tragic lovers, as more correspondence is uncovered.  Searching for clues, Alec meets Maud Bailey (Gwyneth Paltrow) who's an expert in 19th century feminist poets. Maud seems the acerbic scholar but is gradually seduced by the clues to the real life of Christabel and her tryst. And let's not forget the charms of her fellow sleuth Roland.The two 19th-century poets and two 21st century literary sleuths engage each other in post-Victorian and post-modern mating rituals as the latter pair are drawn into the intriguing tale assembled from century-old letters and diaries. Rather than life imitating art, it imitates artistes as Maud and Roland are drawn closer in the mystery as well as the drama. An interesting aspect of studying history is graphically illustrated in this film.  You may think you have got a complete understanding of a character through the writing by and about them, or a time through archeological records, when suddenly a hurricane knocks down a stand of trees and reveals a whole new piece of antiquity that changes everything you thought you knew. The story of this film is a sensual amalgam of verse, intrigue, and professional sleight of hand told with a backdrop of quaint modern Britain and lush Victorian melodrama. This is neither great literature nor great filmmaking but rather an interesting tale for an evenings relaxation. The no sex, we're British rule is seldom violated.

This technique worked more efficiently in The French Lieutenant's Woman and The Bridges of Madison County, but, then again, both of these films had Meryl Streep at its emotional core.  Sadly, she is not here to lift this one.  Contemporary director Neil LaBute, who initially turned heads with his bold, unrelentingly caustic views on love (In the Company of Men, Your Friends & Neighbors), takes on a decidedly different approach, shooting straight for the heart instead of the gut...with mixed results. The contemporary story pairs up Gwyneth Paltrow and LaBute regular Aaron Eckhart as two literary historians who get caught up with one another as they uncover surprising new information, via a chain of age-old love letters, of a torrid, highly discreet affair between two unlikely Victorian poets, played in flash-back by the charismatic Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle. With all this potential talent aboard, someone forgot to add the requisite fire and passion to this supposedly fiery, passionate drama.  The chemistry between Paltrow and Eckhart is strangely lacking.  While Eckhart has a certain scruffy charm, his offbeat, rather jokey approach to this wise-guy character doesn't jell at all with the mood and tone of the piece.  Paltrow, brushing up on her Shakespeare in Love accent, is slightly better (as well she should -- having proven herself earlier in Emma), but, again, her character is given a dull edge and she remains much too placid to ignite the contemporary love story.  Though the classically handsome Northam is the epitome of what a dashing costumed lover should be, and, ditto Ehle, who is reminiscent of Streep here with her serene, delicate, pinched features, their more interesting love story never gets to soar either.  Problematic for them is the pace, which is too languid, and the emotional payoffs, which are either diffused or snuffed out.  Worse yet, the impact of their story is diluted by the incessant narration (via the reading of the love letters) of the contemporary leads.A gallant try I should say, and it is visually beautiful, but I think I'll stick to Merchant/Ivory at this time, thank you.

It had all the elements that I enjoy in a film good actors  (Jennifer Ehle, Jeremy Northam), an interesting premise (especially with the love affair between the two Victorians), and a good setting (the Victorian era is one of my favorites).So, why did I not enjoy it as I thought?  There are a few reasons1.  The modern-day romance between Eckhart and Paltrow was forced and unconvincing and the Victorian romance between Ehle and Northam was completely unemotional, with the exception of a few sweet smiles and loving glances.2.  A plot flaw.  In the beginning, Maud is completely skeptical about the possibility of an affair between the Victorian lovers, being a self-proclaimed expert on Christabel.  She claims that she was faithful to her lover, Blanche.  At this time, though, Maud is aware that Blanche ended her life by drowning herself.  To me, this event alone should present a red flag that something may not have been right between the Christabel and Blanche!3.  The slow movement of the film, combined with seemingly stereotypical characters.  I wouldn't have minded the slowness if the characters were developed more complexly.  Most major characters seemed recycled from other films.7/10 "},{"Title":"Neil LaBute, what happened?","Date":"7 September 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  As a fan of Neil LaBute's other films, as well as his plays bash and The Shape of Things, I went into seeing Possession with mighty tall expectations.  I realized I was not in for a Victorian rendition of The Company of Men, but a completely different kind of story, style and genre than he's used to.  Fine.I have never read the novel from which this screenplay is adapted (by the very talented David Henry Hwang), but even so, I can tell that the screenplay must cut the novel to absolute shreds.  Like throwing the novel into the spinning blades of a helicopter.  The stories, past and present, were so choppy and thrown together, there just HAS to be large pieces missing.Also, some of the minor characters in the movie are just plain pointless, leading me to think that these characters are great in the book, and the screenwriter thought he should include them as virtual cameo appearances rather than omit them completely.  He should have omitted them completely, because you never really see them again and their conversation points go nowhere.The modern-day story of the two literary historians, played by Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckart, is nothing short of contrived and Hallmark-esque cliches.  I admire both actors in their other films, and they do their utmost with the paper-thin characterizations they are handed, but no actor could make these lines stick.  There are simply too many places where you can see the screenwriter agonizing over how to make their love story complex, as he threw in the lamest excuses for arguments and walkouts and pouty faces just to put some conflict there.  And Aaron Eckart is woefully miscast as a library-bound literary researcher.  He looks instead like some wisecracking guy who took English classes to meet girls and kinda stuck with it because, well, he's still trying to meet girls.  With the perpetual Don Johnson stubbleface and the Gap Catalog designer wardrobe, one can't help but question if the character is truly like this in the book, or did Hollywood need to put more asses in the seats with an attempt at eye-candy. It's also getting VERY tiring to see characters of every walk of life portrayed in films by guys who look like they spend the entire day in the gym and couldn't possibly have time to brush their teeth let alone have a full-time job.  Do dedicated academic researchers really look like this? Please!As for the Victorian-era lovers, Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle also do their best with their hackneyed parts.  But their story is choppy as well, and unfortunately the past-era romantic story that sort-of unfolds only serves as the backdrop for the modern-day car crash of a romantic ditty.Part of what made me see this film, other than the engaging trailer and the accomplished cast, was the opportunity to see a modern director known for scripting stories of emotional rawness and even deliberate cruelty between people tackle much different, and somewhat softer and more mainstream, subject matter.  If you are intrigued by the same notion, see David Mamet's The Winslow Boy.  Subtle, nuanced, and a better performance from Jeremy Northam by far.  The tape rental is cheaper than a cinema ticket and you'll be happier!

She was perfect as Viola in Shakespeare In Love and I admired her in Sliding Doors, but I think another actress (maybe a slightly more bookish looking one) would have been more interesting in this role.

The characters of the present seem crude and confused by contrast.

The tragic consequences of this are well portrayed in the movie.  Ultimately, after all, affairs are really very harmful, and despite the fact that at the time they seem of earthshaking importance, they are really quite petty and sordid.

Byatt's `Possession'  what was Neil LaBute doing making this movie?  With his `In the Company of Men' and `Your Friends and Neighbors' LaBute gave us a series of sharply written, well acted scenes that presented a devastating picture of the cruelty of contemporary American men and women in their relations with each other. In `Nurse Betty' he went on to show romantic love as a Quixotic &#150; but also charmingly funny-- woman's fantasy, this time creating a series of memorable and preposterous sequences worthy of Jonathan Demme at his best.But what's LaBute getting at in `Possession,' other than trying to stretch in yet another new direction, this time that of the glossy Merchant/Ivory, Fowles/Pinter world of sophisticated Brit literary adaptations into film? In what way, if any, does LaBute avoid becoming utterly conventional and slick? And why should a man who has done so well with vernacular dialogue among Americans bother to move his regular Aaron Echhart over to England and have Gwyneth Paltrow turn on another la-di-da English accent?The short answer is  God only knows.  The quite polished but uninvolving movie that resulted doesn't provide material for a solid answer or make one truly care.  But there are some clues.  As LaBute's adaptation of the Byatt novel works, it's the Victorians &#150;- the real, British, ones, not their American counterparts -- who've got the romance.  The moderns are pathetically incapable of generating much passion  Paltrow's character is frigid, and Eckhart's is a man who's withdrawn from the fray.  There's some nostalgia added to the old LaBute pessimism here.  The sympathy shown to Renee Zelweger's character in `Nurse Betty' had already suggested that -- a longing on the writer-director's part for a time when romance might have been possible in more than fantasy.  Here the longing is further indulged by constantly sliding back and forth between two worlds, that of the secret, passionate Victorian lovers, and that of the cramped, repressed bureaucratic academic sleuths who're investigating their story.The trouble is that in `Possession' LaBute isn't working in his element in any sense.  We're not getting laughs and we're not getting surprises. Moreover, as an academic couple, Paltrow and Eckart are ridiculous.  Eckart might be believable as some things other than an actor or a model, but academic researcher isn't one of them.  Though studiously ill-groomed, with his perpetual two-days' growth of beard, he's more than anything casually stylish and athletic-looking, and he seems most himself when he strips off his clothes to dive into a roaring stream and test what's behind a waterfall the Victorian lovers once visited.  His enthusiasm for historical sleuthing seems based chiefly on an excessive disregard for legality and a willingness to play with enthusiasm any game that the pretty Gwyneth/Maud wants to play. Paltrow is supposed to be uptight, and that's believable, if you ignore this actress's real life proclivities; but one can never forget that this is a schtick the actress is putting on, and there's no depth to it.  At this point in her career Ms. Paltrow been overexposed and over-lionized and she's begun to lose her power to enchant.Whether the movie would have worked with a different cast is uncertain. Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle are much better than the two American leads as the Victorian lovers, but their scenes are more like a series of tableaux than the full creation of an alternate world that's striven for.  There's some serious question as to whether LaBute and his collaborators on the screenplay, David Henry Hwang and Laura Jones, were able to do justice to the complex Byatt novel in the 103 minutes allotted.  Not only is everything intellectual and academic lost from Paltrow's and Eckart's roles, but so is the intelligence and creativity sapped from the Victorian couple.  Surely the screenplay has simplified the academic and literary milieus and introduced a grating new element in making Roland Mitchell (Eckart) American and all his academic associates Yank-baters.  All this is very far from the inspired use that was made of Renee Zelweger in `Nurse Betty,' and LaBute has robbed us of the chills of his first two movies and the fun of his third and left us with little more than some nice period scenes, some pretty landscapes, and a really dashing and lovely old magenta-red Porsche.

The reader is pulled into the story via the written word and becomes in effect a junior grad student, parsing the poems for meaning. This film and any film of the novel would run into this basic problem--the novel is about reading, but watching people read isn't very exciting.The film turns into something of a muddle. Eckhart and Paltrow don't have any chemistry, and their romantic scenes together seem perfunctory.  LaBute was the wrong director for this film. He made his name portraying misogyny and misanthropy; while he disagrees with the sentiment, he still portrayed it expertly. His toolbox is empty when attempting to tell a story that involves romance, or even a couple people acting like human beings.

Normally, this wouldn't have bothered me much, except for two things--first, as the other reviewer noted, the other characters make such a HUGE deal out of it, that it's laughable.  Every other comment they make to Roland, they insert some reference to his being American.  Second, the reason this change was made is that the director felt that audiences wouldn't understand British class snobbery, and thought nationality snobbery would play better.  Um, ok.  I guess LaBute thinks that an audience that would go to see a somewhat 'historical' costume drama about letters and literature is also stupid. Sure.While I understand that it's impossible to translate this *entire* lengthy, incredibly dense book to the screen, so much was cut out that I couldn't believe it.  Whole swaths of supporting characters are missing, and consequently their interconnecting subplots.  No Val, (though we have Fergus), no Beatrice Nest, no Leonora Stern, no a LOT of people.  Part of the incredible fun of the end of the novel is that all these subplots and characters converge in an astonishing and almost comical way---that was completely lost in the film.The most unforgivable omission, in my opinion, is that there is only the *barest* of references to Christabel's Melusina, and then, only as the 'fairy story'.  Um...isn't that what a large chunk of the book is about? Christabel and her work, which has parallels throughout the story, to Maud, to serpents, 'cold fish', changelings, the color green....and I could go on forever.  There are a small number of instances of green in the film--green dresses on Christabel, a slightly green scarf on Maud...but a viewer would probably never get the allusions without a) mentioning Melusina, and b) having read the book.There are a few scenes/descriptive images taken directly from the book (for instance, the scene in the church in France, where Christabel holds her hands over her abdomen while her cousin Sabine gets a clue), but they are never explained---absolutely nothing is mentioned about how Christabel seems almost not to be aware of her circumstances.  This could have been easily avoided with the deft use of narration from the journals---but it was exceptionally poorly and lazily used instead.  (For an example of good narration, try Age of Innocence, or The Usual Suspects.  This ain't it.) This is only one instance of many where some point is presented or something is mentioned without most or all of the supporting information that helps it to make sense.Another nearly unforgivable change is the lack of attention to hair color. Maud is pale blonde, as she should be---but there's a REASON that she is, and it's more than because Fergus would annoy her about it!  I adore Jennifer Ehle, but her hair should also have been pale blond, as should May's have been.As a side note to the hair issue--in the novel, Maud's hair is not only pulled back, but completely *covered*.  It's an insight into her personality, for one thing.  In the film, it's only in a bun or loose ponytail--so when Roland asks her why her hair is always pulled back like that, it has very little impact.  Many people wear their hair back--it's a common thing to do.  The point is, wearing your hair in a turban in this day and age is NOT common, and thus deserves to be questioned, for it must have an unusual explanation.Before I completely rip the movie apart, here are a few good things.1) It is visually very nice.  Attention was paid to set detail and costuming at least in and of itself, if not its accuracy with the novel.2) The casting was relatively all right.  I'm not sure I'd have cast these precise people in these roles, but all of them are excellent actors in their own right, and none of them (especially Aaron Eckhart) are hard on the eyes. )3) The one scene that I feel the director got nearly perfectly right is the opening/closing scene, with the daisy chain and lock of hair.  The look, colors, emotional feel--everything seemed accurate, and well done.  It's just too bad the whole endeavor couldn't have held to the same standard.The biggest problem with this film (other than the obvious non-sensical changes) is that it's far, far too short.  The director didn't even have the guts, apparently, to make it a full two hours.  Possession really needs to be at minimum a 2-part miniseries, preferably at least a 6-hour series in the tradition of A&E's Pride & Prejudice.Bottom line--not a faithful adaptation--I give it 2 of 4 stars.

I personally think she has lost her gift post-Oscar in a series of too-self-conscious portrayals.  That was the main thing I can identify which kept me at arm's length from Possession.  It would be easy to think someone other than LaBute (probably the worst choice for her to work with) might have brought out something more engaging but the fact is I for one have to look back to Shakespeare in Love to recall the last truly engaging Paltrow, and it's a shame.  It was a bad sign that at some point in the film I found my brain querying as to whether Nicole Kidman might have pulled off the role more effectively.  And it now strikes me as a curious alternative I first came up with given what, as I think about it, strikes me as actresses on very different trajectories, where Kidman in the last year alone has given two performances that lost her one-time self-consciousness or manneredness.

I've enjoyed his previous work, but I scratched my head when I heard he was involved with this adaptation of Byatt's novel. Strangely, it does work pretty well - his usually sharp claws are sheathed. All in all, Possession is a decent film; the cuts from the novel were understandable even if it was a little disappointing not to hear more of Byatt's clever Rossetti/Dickenson/Tennyson spoofs.. I don't think anyone wanted to hear the entirety of 'Ask to Embla' in the film. The movie gets a little flabby in the middle (and there's one soft-core sex scene that looks a bit too much Sinemax at night costume-drama) and the music is intrusive, but there's a great cast, the cinematography was great, and the script well adapted. Loved the fact that the only 'action' scenes in the movie involve a bloody nose. This is chopsockey action for the librarian crowd. Hooray!Two other, minor complaints - Jennifer Ehle as Christabel smiles too much. It was perhaps supposed to be an enigmatic Cheshire Cat effect, but I found it distracting - and there was no chemistry whatsoever between the otherwise very good Paltrow and Eckhart, even taking into account that their modern romance was supposed to appear nervous and self-conscious compared to the sweeping rapture of their literary predecessors. All in all a good effort, and the ending was very touching. I was a little nervous about seeing the film, given how much I enjoyed the book, but I wasn't disappointed.

It's academic pursuit, pampered with passionate love.The settings are so gorgeously visual and they are honed and harnessed so appropriately by the fabulous repertoire of the Lebanese composer, Gabriel Yared. If only the Gywneth Patrow's character isn't so stiff and pretentious, as she attempts to appear reserve and primly scholastic.  The romantic plot and sub-plots are pleasingly quite original, but somehow the events built around the two modern day characters, Roland and Maude, does lack, somehow, the poetic sparks and comic milieu.This movie is about love imitating love, wrapped by trappings of chilling bewilderment. Times may change, but do feelings and personalities? There are moments when the scenes are done with captivating brilliance. At other times, they may appear so dimensionless. It's just not the sort of movie one could possibly want to lose attention over the overlapping narratives and witty dialogue. It's these that make the couples' romantic episodes so chillingly and politically self-imposed to become mirror reflections of the past - whatever the generation gap.The Victorian era is given an amazing breath of elegance and charm, and the modern times shown as contradicting as Randolph Ash's fidelity. Neil LaBute must be having fun trying to bungle the straight-laced conservatism of the Victorian Age with the liberated lifestyle of today's America &#150; where love is involved. And Eckhart's character brings subtle humor to that perception. LaBute certainly paints the romance between intellectuals of the Victorian days with more fervent excitement and intrigue. I had a marvelous time trying to make sense of the parallels of life and fate of the couples in two time periods.  Yep, this film reveals successfully the differences of the eras' cultures, formalities, dictions, and lifestyles and yet gives the viewers the notion that time change has no effect on human bond and feelings. It's watching the story of Randolph Ash and Christabel LaMotte unfolding that of Roland Mitchell and Maude Bailey. Gosh, the costume designs are top-notch - so wonderfully appropriate to the two periods.Gwyneth Paltrow's character is too icy cold and wooden and should have 'let her hair hang loose' right from the beginning, to allow the on-screen chemistry develop between her Maude and Aaron Eckhart's Roland. But I'm truly enchanted by the talents of Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle. Their characters' story is more appealing than that of Eckhart and Paltrow's characters'.  However, Eckhart does play his role credibly. His Roland's the present-day outcast whose stature is not an under-play of Christabel's lesser status.  It's amusing to watch his scruffy scholarly character, trying to fit in with the snooty, snobbish and uptight British intellectuals.  Ouch, he's such a down-to-earth charmer! Norman is so cool and charismatic, and Ehle is very delightful to watch. Hey, doesn't Lena Headley's Blanche carry such uncanny sensual uppity pomp to deserve a 'thumbs-up' cheer for her role?  A great cast!This is a nice amusing movie, and it did make my friend emotionally moved&#133; I actually heard her sob! And I do love the subtle messages, underlying this film. Hhhmh, at the end of the film, I was left with the question  to whom should we allow history to be dictated and defined?  Clearly, I'm landed with the belief that facts are only in the eyes of the unscrupulous beholders. Am I to believe that love orders universal behavioral interactions, not afflicted by time constraint? Yep, that's my opinion, of &#145;cos!

A noteworthy event, since this meant that I was probably going to add a new name to my list of favorite filmmakers. His name is Neil LaBute, and while none of his movies have been my favorites, all seem to illustrate an insight into one aspect of humanity that evoke a strong reaction, or at least, reflect one. And yet, none of his films explore the full range of `character' that a person may possess. Rather, each film seems to explore just one aspect of the human condition. Hence, LaBute's forte as a filmmaker must be viewed not for the quality of one movie, but for the group as a whole.His latest (and 6th) film is called `Possession,' a quiet little romance drama, adapted from A.S. Byatt's 1990 novel of the same name. The plot involves the intertwining of two unlikely couples separated by a hundred years. Aaron Eckhart, who's starred in the last four of LaBute's films, plays Roland Michell, an American studying in London. He is researching the poet laureate for Queen Victoria, Randolph Henry Ash from 1869 when he discovers a cache of love letters that appear to be from Ash to a little-known poetess named Christabel LaMotte, played by Jennifer Ehle, who looks remarkably like a young Meryl Streep. His research into this mysterious and unknown romance brings him to Maud Bailey, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, a rather straight-laced English academic researching LaMotte's life and work. Maud is initially dismissive of the discoveries, but the premise intrigues her, not to mention the chemistry she feels for the young American. As they collaborate on uncovering the romantic mysteries between the Victorian-era poets, they also discover romantic mysteries between themselves.What's so delightful about this film, which is also a feature that will almost assuredly put off mainstream audiences, is that the theme of the film suggests that it's gripping drama to have a famous (and fictitious) poet in English literature carry on an affair with another poet, turning the world of Victorian poetry upside side. Add to this delightful tryst, the tension between the romantically dysfunctional couple of Roland and Maud, both of whom have vowed never to indulge in romance again, and you may have hoards of sex-starved librarians breaking down the turnstiles to see this film over and over. Oh, Shades of excitement!Kidding aside, this film is so nice and sweet, that it almost seems like a departure for LaBute's tendency to portray more tumultuous emotional characteristics. Yet, taken as a part of his entire body of work, which is still small and growing, yet promising, despite one or two pitfalls along the way, `Possession' shows the lighter and more sophisticated side of the filmmaker, who isn't afraid to approach light-hearted subjects and still depict a sense of realism. I loved this film, but one day, I hope and expect that LaBute will break into the limelight with a more profound film that does more than portray human character. He'll make us ponder it.

Discovery after discovery they finish by finding documents (i. e. letters) that show new clues which lead to results confirming that in fact the poet had a love relationship with a poetess of his times though only for a short period. The movie develops itself in two parallel folds closely intertwined in an intelligent cut, one showing the scenes lived by the two researchers while the other goes 100 years back to show the scenes of the love story between the two poets. The succession of sequences of both epochs is very agile and sometimes there isn't even a shot changing; a simple camera horizontal traveling takes us to the 19th century even since many scenes of both times take place at the same spots, interior or exterior. Of course from a certain moment on and very naturally, the professional relation between the two researchers transforms itself into a love one that runs parallel to the other one. Both love stories are somewhat complicated the first one because we are in Victorian times where such extramarital relations were not simple at all and besides that we are in presence of two spiritually and intellectually superior human beings that live their love in a refined way though not exempt of doubts and uncertainties; the second one because the researchers are also superior beings and the love freedom of the current times has not freed lovers from similar doubts and uncertainties. The movie's detective feature appears now and then in moving episodes like for instance the fight at the cemetery near the end. Another existential curiosity is when the poet says at a certain point that he goes on loving his wife though in a manner different of the one in which he loves the other woman. This is very modern because nowadays some psychologists discuss the possibility of a man loving two women (or a woman two men) simultaneously though in different ways. Finally we can perhaps say that both love stories though genuine and authentic lack some deepness in terms of analysis. Nevertheless this is a good movie worth to be seen.

The poet was known for his filial devotion to his wife of many years.Our American Aaron Eckhardt however gets a hold of a letter which implies a relationship with a female poet of the same era. That particular poet is a little less known, but among her followers she has a reputation as a feminist icon and a lesbian. He goes to another scholar Gwyneth Paltrow who specializes in the feminist and they begin a hunt through both the records and the places of encounter they've documented.The romance part of Possession I get. Paltrow and Eckhardt are as civilized a pair of lovers you'll ever meet. Their romantic scenes are tastefully and exquisitely handled. So are the Victorian flashback sequences of Jeremy Northam and Jennifer Ehle. Academicians at least as I've always pictured them are in a search for the truth. Those opposing Paltrow and Eckhardt seem to have a big vested interest in keeping the images of the two poets as they've come down in history as they are. Why we the audience should care is another matter. It's kind of like The Fountainhead where some kind of popular movement is started against Howard Roarke and his ideas even though I daresay 96% of the population could give a ringy rat's rectum about architectural styles or the reputations of two 19th century poets.To put it in popular terms it would be like Abraham Lincoln scholars discovering letters showing he had a passionate affair with Clara Barton during the Civil War.

But who cares? So may future scholars sift through recent e-mails to discover that Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affeck continued to bear each other affection after 'Gigli'. The prurience of the search is very off-putting. Poems (like any artistic product) do stand by themselves.And why should the affairs of past poets merit greater interest than, say, the love lives of current poets like Donald Hall or John Ashberry? Or for that matter, non-poets? What is the state of the scholarship on the private life of CIA Director George Tenet or retiring Senator Fritz Hollings, wedding dress designer Vera Wang or Austrian politician Haider?There is no more greater basis to intrude into the private lives of the past than to engage in the coarse gossip and prying into the lives of the present. It's ugly - yet the movie fails to understand the viewer's reaction to the costuming of these salacious apes as scholars.An enormous problem is that we've no idea why either couple is drawn to each other. One look - and they're all apparently on fire - even though the Victorian man is in a good marriage and the Victorian woman is a lesbian with some relationship with another. The modern couple is shown as without any pledged troth to betray - but we still don't understand what would cause either to fall for the other. Another problem is the repeated references to Gwynneth Paltrow as beautiful - she quite obviously isn't. This causes the viewer to shake his head and mutter no, no. Obviously Ms. Paltrow is no Jacqueline Bisset, no Diana Rigg, no Elizabeth Hurley, Jane Seymour, Catherine Zeta-Jones or Joely Richardson in looks. And it distances the viewer because it makes him realize how far he i from the male character's point of view.**** SPOILERS **** Another problem is that it is extremely difficult to identify with the Victorian couple because they are simply engaged in stupendous betrayals of others who love them. Passion is very common. Every human being is the result of it. A central theme of literature is the effort to reign it in - the heroic act of resistance to the indulgence of lust when it will destroy the lives of others. So, where is the effort to avoid harm to others? Where is the recognition by the man of his pledge to God and all those he knew, to remain faithful throughout his life to the woman he has freely chosen? Because we don't see him struggling AT ALL but see only the immature pursuit of the newest lust, we don't sympathize with him at all - or the actions that led to the illegitimate daughter's birth. A grand romance this is not - but a terribly tawdry business dressed up by poetry. Again, this is ugly stuff.**** SPOILERS END ****I don't understand why the American is made so unappealing - so slovenly in appearance, so strangely inarticulate, so thieving, greedy for the celebrity of the gossip columnist.

Eckhart, his intentions somewhat unclear, begins tedious research with the help of expert Gwyneth Paltrow and soon a heartbreaking love story starts between Northam and Ehle via intense flashbacks. It appears that Eckhart is out to make a name for himself, but all that almost immediately takes a backseat as he starts to realize just how personal and passionate the past relationship was. And soon he finds that perhaps he could find love with Paltrow in the process. During the flashbacks the fact that Northam was married to a loving wife (Holly Arid) and that Ehle had a lover of her own (Lena Headey) only adds to the tragedy. Northam and Headey had a platonic marriage though and Ehle obviously finally found her one true love in him. The affair leads to what could be described as silent fireworks as the major players (past and present) are all affected in one way or another. Co-writer/director Neil LaBute (who hit a grand slam in his film-making debut with In the Company of Men, probably one of the best films of recent memory that no one has heard about) chooses a very strange topic here and nearly pulls off a truly emotional and exceptional experience. I must admit I think the flashbacks are excellent. Northam does probably the best work of his career and Ehle matches his brilliance step-for-step. With that said, Possession fails in the present-day of its story. Gwyneth Paltrow (probably the most over-rated actress today) and Aaron Eckhart just generate no chemistry between them. They end up going through a sometimes tiring Hardy Boys routine and I found myself constantly wishing that the film would go back to the Northam and Ehle characters. Honestly I think the movie would have been a masterpiece if the old affair was the only focus.

By tracing old poems, letters, and even staying in the same hotel room the poets shared over a century ago, Roland and Maud eventually find themselves falling in love with each other as well. Predictable ho-hum romantic movie fare, but not at all a bad way to spend 102 minutes. And all the poetry they keep spouting out made me feel a little bit smarter after the movie was done.

It is set in modern day England where Paltrow and Eckhart are academic scholars of Victorian poets and it is one of the most touching films I have seen in some time.  Roland Michell (Eckhart) is an American on a fellowship to study a poet named Randolph Henry Ash whose Centennial the Brits are currently celebrating. Through a series of events Roland discovers that the married Ash believed never to have as much as looked at another woman, may have had a torrid affair with another Victorian poet named Christabel LaMotte.  Roland's investigation leads him to seek out Maud Bailey (Paltrow) an authority on the life and works of LaMotte.  Together they become detectives in search of the truth and along the way fall in love with each other.The film cuts flawlessly back and forth from the modern to the Victorian era making pure cinematic magic. Notham as Ash and Jennifer Ehle as LaMotte are pure delight.The screenplay by David Henry Hwang based on a novel by AS Byatt is wonderful, as is the direction by Neil LaBute.

However, I tried to watch the movie unbiased, since even a failed adaptation might be quite enjoyable as a movie in its own right.Sadly, it wasn't.The movie had some (okay, maybe two or three) great scenes. Jeremy Northam (as Randolph Henry Ash) and especially Jennifer Ehle (as Christabel LaMotte) manage to convey intriguing characters, even with very limited time and dialogue. Too bad, though, that a movie revolving around two poets should contain so little poetry - Ash and LaMotte supposedly recognise each other as kindred minds and succumb to the power of each other's words, but what we actually see is just another pretty couple falling rather randomly in love. But whereas Northam and Ehle could still be quite believable as poets, Paltrow and Eckhart fail utterly as scholars. They do not say a single intelligent or scholarly thing. The only academic zeal they display is the occasional petty theft. They do not show any appreciation of their research subjects - Eckhart's character in particular seems too stupid to even copy-and-paste an undergraduate paper together, let alone to be the type of guy who would devote his life to the analysis of Victorian poetry. And I'm not even talking about the utter ridiculousness of Paltrow, with her perfectly plucked eyebrows and carefully applied layers of makeup, talking about her 'feminist sisters'. ...oh, Aaron Eckhart and his infuriating grin and pasted-on 'brashness' - how I wanted to punch him in the face. But I digress.Now and then, fragments of subplot can be discerned among the endless demonstrations of Paltrow and Eckhart's painful lack of chemistry. Mortimer Cropper occasionally pops up, but it is hard to tell why, since none of his brief appearances influences the main storyline in any way. (Apart from one of the final scenes of course, which I will not spoil, but here, too, he somehow conveniently disappears when it's time for Paltrow and Eckhart to steal the show again. They must have killed him off-screen, or something.) Also, a solicitor is introduced, but his function remains a mystery. The presence of these unnecessary elements is even more painful in the face of the absence of some much more obviously valuable ones - like Val, or Leonora. They could even have introduced an actual Roland, rather than two versions of Fergus Wolff! They could have used the time devoted to the useless solicitor by including some actual poetry!But, well, who needs poetry when we can have two pretty people kissing their way towards a cardboard happy ending?

And we also know (because its a film) that the two Victorian poets HAVE a relationship because otherwise the movie wouldn't have been made. I blame the writer and the director for failing to see that you can't have a drama without giving the audience some reason to care about the characters.I surely didn't care about the two Victorian poets. I also didn't care for either of the two modern scholars. All the characters in the movie were paper thin with nothing but affectations instead of actual personality.If you are going to do an historical film then you have to make the audience care by giving meaning to the lives of the people you are filming. In this film all meaning and drama that was possible in the lives of the Victorians was removed by the constant intercutting of the modern-day scenes. Never, never do this! The constant intercutting of the modern world kept reminding the viewer that the past is dead and the actions by these dead people ultimately made no difference to anybody living today (because if it had, the modern day scholars would know about it).Bottom line if you are looking for entertainment there is nothing good to say about this film and no reason to watch it.

However I am well acquainted with the talented Jennifer Ehle and Jeremy Northam who I loved in Pride & Prejudice and Emma respectively.Although the plot of this film is exceptional, and the manner in which they managed to blend the old scenes with the new are phenomenal, I still somehow felt let down in the end.  The colour and vision used in directing the scenes between Northam and Ehle were fantastic and I could have watched the whole film in that time.  I totally felt the characters of Christbelle Lamott and Randolph Ash, and the two actors who played their roles, did a remarkable job!  They really came to life and I enjoyed watching them on screen.However, Gwyneth Paltrow did nothing for me except sound and look like an old english mam and I was disappointed to note the total LACK of chemistry between her and Eckhardt!  Where they were lacking though Ehle and Northam lit the screen!  Eckhardt's American accent also stood out too much and at times I found it irritating, like it wasn't supposed to be there.Once again, Ehle and Northam shine in this period drama, clearly at home in their surroundings, whereas Gwyneth did a much better role in Emma, with Northam, than she did following his life in this film.  Although I enjoyed the movie, I still felt that there were some things missing. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Great Film! Loved it! Great Date Movie!","Date":"24 August 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  If you are a fan of Jane Eyre(sp?), you'll love this movie.  My wife and I (and my family for that matter) are fans, and we loved this movie.I was not expecting what I saw.  The previews did not portray the movie well, at all.  After seeing previews, I really could care less if I saw the movie.But, my wife thought it seemed interesting, so we went to see it.And, boy, was I glad.  I loved it!  Some really interesting Cinematography shots.Can't wait for the DVD.  I know there is more history behind Maud that we might see in the DVD.

So I was pleasantly surprised by this Mr. LaBute's most realized film. It stars Aaron Eckhart who has been in every one of Mr. Labute's movies - I understand they are fellow Mormans & have known each other from their college days at Bingham Young. Religion has nothing to do with this or any other LaBute film as far as I can tell. This movie is pure poetry & beautiful to look at. Its many charms can be enjoyed with many viewings which is a good indication Possession may well become a classic.

Unfortunately, the modern day lovestory is so miscast it doesn't take flight. Gwyneth Paltrow is goodas a repressed academic but she is supposed to succumb topassion. Regret/discomfort is as close as she gets. Aaron Eckhart is very athletic with an undercurrent of aggression and anger that make his fist-fight toward the end of the movie and his stealingletters believable, but he is not at all convincing as a grad studentstudying a Victorian poet.  He is even less convincing as thereluctant previously-burned lover required by the script (but mighthave been great as a predator who gets caught).  No poetry there!Too bad.  I read the book years ago and seem to remember thatvictorian poesy triumphed in modern times with modern loversagainst all the odds.

That said, I have a few beefs The American jokes got tedious. Yeah, yeah, yeah ... we know there are differences. Just shut up and demonstrate them if you have to; it's a visual medium, you know. Paltrow's icy Brit is just too much. I was painfully aware that this is an American playing a Brit. Some actresses can't seem to entirely get out of their own way. (Thankfully, Jennifer Ehle can.) Roland had a one-day growth of beard in every scene. How roguish! How does a man always keep his whiskers that length? When I get tripped up by silly details, I'm not getting lost in the film. I wanted to get lost in this one.

There seems to be some movie-making trends here worth noting--intertwining past events in literary lives with modern characters and portraying gifted English lesbians drowning themselves.The price paid for the powerful script and incredible ensemble acting in The Hours is the acknowledgment of a heavy handed message that modern liberal social consciousness combined with high technology (in this instance gay rights and artificial insemination) can allow people formerly defined as deviant to enjoy the same degree of life's pleasures and miseries as the rest of us.How unfortunate for those preferring heterosexuality that the capacity of even a talented poet to sway a woman away from her lesbian lover was scripted in a manner that was relatively unconvincing.Still, Possession, although slow moving, was acceptable entertainment during a blizzard.

Henry Ash. While in their investigation, the researchers fall in love.I keep the poets, spare me the researchers. I just didn't care for the falling in love of Maud and Roland, it was all too predictable. The movie goes from LaMotte-Ash to Maud-Roland constantly. As I said I keep the LaMotte-Ash story.The only good thing I could see apart from that is Gwyneth Paltrow. She is the one element that keeps the movie from being a total fiasco. It's always a pleasure seeing her perform. She upgrades the movie from garbage to plain forgettable.

Thats why I enjoyed All The Presidents Men so much. I find it very interesting to watch them discover things and try to deduce facts and reason them out. But one thing that I did care that much about was the romantic angle between Paltrow and Eckhart. I just didn't care for they're feelings for one another. Movies just can't team a man and a woman together and not have them get romantic. It seems forced. I know this is based on a book and thats probably what happened in it but I still thought it got in the way! Paltrow's english accent isn't to bad either.

The audience will realize this difference from the two parallel love stories that shape the film along with other exciting actions. Unlike the 1900's idealistic love affairs, now a day's couples are more realistic. The equality of men and women that has been grown though out the century is quite visible in the film. Nevertheless the beautiful romance in the 1900's and before, is as lovely as the reasonable love lives of the today's people.

S. Byatt is one of my favourite writers and I read the book with curiosity. I never watch a movie which is based on a novel before reading the novel itself and this was like this also.It's a very very long and condensed book. After the book I watched the movie and at some point, like towards the end I thought that I read the book wrong. The scenario is awful that it is not about the book. It is kind of an independent screenplay.This is not fair for such an awesome book!!! The movie killed the book!!! "}]
