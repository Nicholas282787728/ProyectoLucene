When I need brain candy, I can rely on Matt Stone and Trey Parker to deliver.Orgazmo is full of potty humour, blasphemy, and other rudeness.  It relentlessly mocks  religious zealots, the porn industry, and nearly everything in between.There is nothing good about the acting or production qualities -- in fact, the *poor* acting and production qualities add to the humour, I think, in the same way that the cheesy attempt at animation adds to the humour of South Park.  The entertainment value of 'Orgazmo' lies primarily in the situation -- and even if the individual jokes are not fantastically original, the situation *is*.  It's just good, stupid fun.Think of the rudest, raunchiest of all the South Park episodes -- like the one where Cartman joins NAMBLA, or the one where the kids start a fad of sexually stimulating dogs.  If you enjoyed those, you will probably enjoy Orgazmo.  If you didn't appreciate the humour or found them offensive, don't bother with this movie.Personally, my tastes are so base that I consider this one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen.

Following Cannibal The Musical, the duo of Trey Parker and Matt Stone satire the world of Adult Entertainment.The story follows the exploits of a Mormon missionary named Joe (Trey Parker) who by accident becomes the industry's biggest star Orgazmo. A sleazy producer makes Trey an unwilling indentured servant. Joe's life is also plagued by his religious devotion to the mother church and his fiancée. Can Joe resolves these problems by the movie's end? Matt Stone co-stars as a set still photographer. Dian Bachar also co-stars as Orgazmo's sidekick and friend Choda Boy. Lloyd Kaufmann (founder of Troma Studios) and many stars of the Adult Entertainment make cameo appearances as well.I enjoyed this movie. It was real funny and highly entertaining. Trey Parker did a great job of writing and directing this movie. The movie is even better if you're familiar with the porn business or know some of the stars. Too bad this movie was barely released and it seems to have been forgotten about on video. If you love South Park or enjoyed Cannibal The Musical then I advise you to pick up a copy of this movie. You will not be disappointed.Highly recommended.

You can't watch a movie like this and think even for a second that it is meant to be taken seriously, or even that it takes itself seriously. And all of this is clear just from looking at the cover box, so you know from the minute that you pick the movie up that you are about to watch an extremely goofball comedy. With that in mind, you can really appreciate Orgazmo for what it is.Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the famous creators of South Park and the hilarious BASEketball, have returned with another comedy, this one with much less taste but at least as many laughs. Orgazmo is the story of a Mormon missionary who inadvertently winds up starring in an adult film in Los Angeles, but who never seems to lose his faith. Trey Parker plays Elder Young, the above-mentioned missionary, and also writes and directs this unusually amusing b-movie.Orgazmo is a straightforward film that has a very obvious intent. It is aimed at the same audience as other infinitely inferior movies like Scary Movie and Scary Movie 2, but it actually succeeds because its creators have some filmmaking talent that goes beyond a simple purge of every disgusting joke that they learned in fourth grade. Parker and Stone are just naturally funny guys, as has become obvious by now, which is why they have managed to take the potential-free combination of the porn industry and a tiny budget and make it into a hilarious comedy.Trey Parker plays Elder Young, a missionary assigned to do his mission work in Hollywood, and in a hilarious run-in with porn director Max Orbison, he ends up defending himself against a gang of thugs and thereby earning a high paying position as the leading man in Orbison's newest porno. Seduced by the offer of a huge amount of money, which he plans to spend on a house for himself and his ridiculous girlfriend (`Jesus and I love you!'), Young agrees to take on the role, provided he doesn't have to do any actual intercourse. Sound like the makings for a great comedy? No? Exactly! That's what makes it so good! This material is total crap, but that's where the comedy comes from! This is a spoof of lots of different types of films, not the least of which are martial arts films, for reasons which you'll just have to watch the movie to see, and it succeeds on many different levels.The characters are hilarious (there is a truly classic moment when Choda Boy explains to Young that, believe it or not, he doesn't get a lot of action from women. The fact that he's strapping a dildo to the top of his head might have something to do with that.), and there are just some great scenes. The movie is aware of its place, and it doesn't try to pretend that it is something that it's not. Get a bunch of your buddies together and have a couple beers while you watch this movie, you'll love it.

That being said, I really enjoyed Orgazmo. Parker doesn't just make fun of Mormons, adult entertainment, and super-heroes as always, he makes fun of himself and his own movie. How could he possibly do such a thing? Well, it's easy when you have a sense of humor. The great Don Rickles once said, Laugh. Laugh at other people and laugh at yourself.

He fails at that, but succeeds at being the luckless star of low-budget adult film, Orgazmo, featuring a super-hero who wears a weapon that induces instantaneous orgasms in his foes and a stalwart sidekick, Choda-Boy, who wears a serendipitous dildo atop his head.The performances were rather good, especially director/writer Trey Parker as our heroic protagonist, and Dian Bachar, as the scientist turned porn star.

Man, I hate being right all the time. During the first three quarters of the movie (that's all my friends and I could stomach before turning it off), I think I might have chuckled once. I can't believe Parker had actually improved on his mediocre, juvenile, body of work with South Park and Team America World Police. This film didn't even have shock value, a seemingly must-have for Parker. It chronicles a Mormon missionary's transformation into a male porn star. Sound stupid? It actually plays out worse than it sounds. But it's not the plot that drives a decent comedy, it's the humor, right!? I wish it did. The jokes in this movie are so witless, it makes South Park look like Frasier. Running gags that aren't funny the first time are rehashed again and again in the same pointless manner. Instead of making satirical jabs at the porn industry or the Mormon religion, Parker makes dimwitted toilet jokes and calls his sidekick Choda boy. That's not even funny! Which brings me to the other downsides of this movie. Other than an unfunny, trite script and a stupid story, the cinematography is horrible, even for a comedy flick, the characters range from annoying to detestable, and the poor production quality makes this movie even worse than it already is. The only thing shocking about this movie is that Trey Parker wasn't lynched for making it. If I could, I would give this movie negative stars. Avoid at all costs. Rent Billy Madison, Wayne's World, or Tommy Boy instead. Don't waste your money on this witless wonder.

Trey Parker and Matt Stone can be quite funny and I thought certain scenes of Team America were genius. (And others... not so much.) But their second film outing, Orgazmo, has to be their weakest effort. I expected a clever and crude satire of the porn industry -- instead I just got stupid crude humor without many laughs.I did chuckle a few times, at some jokes that were so obvious and over-the-top and juvenile that they hit the funnybone if you're in an amiable mood.

Essentially the film is a kick in the face to religion and caused a lot of controversy when it was released. The MPAA tagged it with an NC-17 rating and it flopped on release.It has a weak cult following now due to the success of Parker and Stone's reputations as funny troublemakers, but the fact is that Orgazmo really is just controversial for the sake of being so. It's not nearly as funny as it thinks it is.On top of that, the new DVD is a huge disappointment also. The cast commentary track is inaudible and barely distinguishable. The Wild commentary track is similarly hard to hear and pretty poor. When I read that Kevin Smith and Weird Al Yankovic were on the track I thought, Wow. Little did I know that they are split into separate groups and only on the track for about ten minutes each. Yankovic is the funniest but most of his jokes are lame. Smith has never seen Orgazmo and only relays a story of how he used to hate Trey Parker and Matt Stone, and his audio is recorded from a telephone conversation.The documentaries are stupid and poor and the rest of the special features are just plain lame.Overall, a really disappointing experience.

But just like every other successful person, they had to start somewhere. Parker and Stone started their careers by creating low budget comedy movies. The first full-length movie they created was the 1993 black comedy named Cannibal! The Musical aka Alferd Packer The Musical and then, several years after, in 1997, they finished the interestingly named comedy Orgazmo. Orgazmo, while not being a particularly good movie, is a good early example of Parker and Stone's distinguished sense of humour.Orgazmo is about a young Mormon named Joe Young (Trey Parker) who is in a happy relationship with his fiancée Lisa. They plan on getting wedded in some church or something, but unfortunately they have no money to do so. However, Joe, for no apparent reason, has extremely good fighting skills, which come in handy when a porn director named Maxxx Orbison (Michael Dean Jacobs) sees him beating up a couple of guys and decides to hire him in his newest porn/super-hero movie. Joe reluctantly accepts, but says he will only do the actual acting, none of the intercourse. They agree on using a 'stunt cock' to film all his sex scenes. And so Joe finds himself playing the title role of Orbinson's newest movie &#x96; Orgazmo.The premise of the movie is very silly and very 'South Park-esque', if I may add. But what works in animation, doesn't necessarily work in non-animated movies &#x96; especially when it comes to humour. And the humour in Orgazmo is very versatile &#x96; there's toilet humour, there's spoof humour, there's self-parodying (the movie deliberately looks bad from time to time) and there's original jokes. When a movie has so many different types of humour in it, it's hard to enjoy every one of them. The toilet humour is the one that bothered me the most and I found those jokes to be the least funny ones. Apart from that, I did laugh quite a few times.The acting in Orgazmo is classic 'low budget-trashy' and it doesn't want to be anything more. However, the interesting thing is that a big number of actors starring in Orgazmo are actual porn stars &#x96; the most prominent being Ron Jeremy and Chasey Lain. All in all, Orgazmo is just another trash movie that may be fun but truly isn't anything special. If you are a die hard fan of South Park/Trey Parker/Matt Stone, do check out this early creation, you'll probably be pleasantly surprised.

As Parker is looking to have a big blowout of a wedding in the Temple in Salt Lake City he knows it costs big bucks. He takes up the offer to be a porn superhero although he's firm on not having any penetration. He hits it off with Dian Bachar who plays his Robin the boy wonder sidekick Choda Boy. Bachar is a scientist also, but does porn because he even in his nerd persona gets a lot more sex than he would under normal circumstances. Bachar has also invented a portable addition of what Woody Allen and Diane Keaton would enjoy a few hundred years later in Sleepers. Bachar was my favorite character in the film.These two grow into their roles with some ultimate method acting as they start to think they're real superheroes. That portable Orgasmatron proves to be quite the weapon. It does what Divine did to Geoff Lewis's whole gang in Lust In The Dust. Villains don't really know how to deal with it.In the end Parker and Bachar are on a whole different kind of mission.LDS members might find it offensive, but I wouldn't take Orgazmo all that seriously.

So many people take offense to them, when in the same episode they're offended about, they'll make fun of themselves. It's silly to take any movie offensively that is a comedy, unless there were blatant racism or homophobia, or those kind of socially unacceptable things to joke about, which these guys do push the lines on some of that too in other projects.This movie definitely mocks the LDS church, but I was Mormon when I watched it, I wasn't going actively, but I believed it, and I thought it was hilarious. Anyone who is LDS could see that almost every representation of the religion is completely inaccurate. For example getting married in a LDS Temple is mentioned in the movie as costing thousands of dollars or whatever, which if someone that is LDS follows the churches teachings, pays their tithing (the only money that has to be spent to my knowledge), and is morally on-point enough according to some fairly high-up church authorities. The only thing that an LDS member that is rational and open-minded might find offensive is the nudity and porn element, which is part of the story, but isn't actual porno. There is some nudity, but it is primarily a man's buttocks, or a woman's breasts.The bottom line is that this movie is funny, but you have to look at it light-heartedly, and take it for what it is. Comedy. The comedy is quite a bit different of a style of humor than South Park, you can see that the same people make it, but it's a completely different type of humor... So check it out, I highly recommend this movie, and I am very particular about movies, I've worked in a movie store, and I know a lot of film elitist's, and a lot of them like this movie.

The guards are ordered to mess him up, but he defends himself and impresses film director Maxxx Orbison with his amazing martial arts. After some major persuading and naivety, Young lands the lead role of an X-rated superhero flick without having to engage in intercourse, mainly to earn enough money for a perfect wedding. Thanks to the fresh comedy of writer/director/star Trey Parker and Matt Stone (who had not yet released their ground-breaking TV show South Park), the film is rescued from being a complete dud of an acting showcase for actual adult film stars. My favorite scene is the happy place montage Young is forced to find while being violated by an obese, uh, actress named T-Rex. Orgazmo is an unapologetic, tasteless, mind-numbingly dumb piece of work with many funny bits scattered about - just the right rehearsal Parker and Stone needed for their opus.

When the owner tells his goons to 'get rid of them' the goons take it how goons would, and we are introduced to our hero...one of the missionaries (Trey Parker) whips all four goons while his partner makes his escape. The movie producer sees this and offers our hero a role in his new movie...enticing our hero Joe Young with enough money for him to be able to marry his sweetheart in the Temple in Salt Lake City.The fact that this is a pornographic movie of course deters Joe, but the fact he will get to wear a mask and will have a...stunt double...for scenes he doesn't want anything to do with, sway him to go ahead and take the job.Of course, our charitable movie producer isn't really so charitable. Also we find that the actor who will play Joe Young's sidekick (Dian Bachar) is a genius who invents stuff, and lo and behold he has just recently managed to create a very real Orgasmatron, the fictional weapon the movie hero wields.From there it is a rather simple story line delivered with low-brow hilarity.Look for a variety of real porn stars included in the cast, and if you can get ahold of a DVD that has the extras and learn the story of them making the movie and trying to get it distributed. It makes a good comparison of how indie filmmakers get treated differently than larger movie studios, as well as interesting comments regarding the difference between 'regular' Hollywood types versus the porn industry.

Through a series of events (none too ludicrous), he winds up with an offer to be in a new porn film, Orgazmo. Due to his faith, he has obvious doubts. However, he has a sweetheart, Lisa, who sorely wants to be married to Joe in a muslim temple (?), which is fortunately the only inaccruate thing in the film (they don't charge for marriages).Joe meets several Adult film actors-Ben aka. Choda Boy in the film (he bemuses that no one takes his seriously, while strapping a dildo to his head), who becomes a good friend of Joe's during the film.He also meets Candi and Saffi, two female stars.They hang out after work in a sushi bar run by G-Fresh, a Japanese rapper (played by the same actor who played the Nihongin Cheif in Cannibal! The musical) and see a racketeering operation threatening G-Fresh to move out.Later, Ben shows Joe the Orgasmorator. Based on a prop in the porn movie they are both working, the Orgasmorator fires a purple beam into people, causing them to...you know... Ben and Joe take it upon themselves to take out the racketeers and destroy a contract G-Fresh was forced to sign.The next day, Ben finds out that the porno director, Maxxx Orbison is also the head of the racketeering operation. Ben urges Joe to take up the fight again, this time on the Maxxx. Joe declines and then finds his fiancee Lisa back at his condo, for a suprise visit. He is shocked and worried (He has been telling Lisa the money is coming from a production of Death of a salesman). The porno is a huge hit, promting a sequel which Joe reluctantly agrees to, due to an increased pay check (though in the films, Joe only acts and fights-for the love scenes a Stunt Cock is used).However, due to lack of payment, Joe declines to return to work. Lisa is kidnapped and Joe and Ben rejoin and head for a final battle.I won't mention any more except that the end resolution features the I've learned something today... line, also used in Cannibal, BASEketball and all South Park episodes.The film is ironic, because it's a film about crime and porn but it's a completely innocent story-Joe does it for love, takes out the bad guys and saves the day. It also features mild swearing (harsh words but not in harsh circumstances) and brief mild nudity (a man's behind).I found this film extremely funny, with some great moments. The acting is all good, the humour is good natured and at no one's expense and it has a linear and consistant plot.A good film. Hope the Special Edition DVD comes out soon.

Matt Stone as Dave the lighting guy who doesn't like to sound like a queer or nothing is mildly amusing, but Trey Parker, as the Mormon missionary turned porn film actor, puts on once of the best displays of comic innocence I've ever seen (he must have used it on the producers to get the money for this film). It was fun to hear the dulcet tones of Eric Cartman as Orgazmo swung into action, before, in fact, that most ghastly of the Southpark mob had appeared in public. It's also fun seeing the real porn actors playing themselves though why anybody would go to bed with Ron Jeremy (or watch him) is a total mystery. Yet he has been in an astounding 580 porn films, according to this database, having started his film career as an extra in `Jesus Christ Superstar'. If I were in the porn industry I think I'd feel a bit exploited. Oh, well, perhaps that justifies `Orgazmo.' At the end of the day, though, this film is one more example to prove P T Barnum's dictum that nobody ever went broke underestimating public taste. Given the number of bad movies around, I don't see the point of talented people making deliberately bad ones, except as a tax loss. Perhaps that was the plan, ruined by the success of  `Southpark'!

Hailing from South Park fame, Parker hits it again in this slightly crude, yet absorbingly humorous comedy.The story focuses mainly on a Mormon missionary named Joe Young who ends up being sent to Los Angeles to convert the masses. Heading door to door, Young, played by Parker, ends up inadvertently staring in a porn film. I believe the words Hi-jinx ensues apply here. The jokes in the movie, for the most part, poke fun at both the porn industry and the Mormon faith. They don't, however, take on the biting and somewhat overdone humour found in some of Parker's other project, and end up staying quite light hearted.Although it relies somewhat heavily on sight gags of the more raunchy persuasion, the chemistry between Parker and fellow Baseketball star Dian Bachar lifts the film to a new level. Special kudos to Bachar for a particularly beautiful performance as Ben Chapelski (AKA Choda Boy). His style of mixing melodrama with a baby-faced innocence brings this movie from the level of a run-of-the-mill post-National Lampoon comedy to a film that stands out.All in all the movie is a definate pick up when perusing the shelves of your local videostore. The surprising lack of excessive nudity makes it safe for almost any viewer, while the humor is quick paced and rarely segments factions of society away from it, as Parker's comedy tends to do.

Parker and Stone are still getting used to the feature-length format, and the film has a few rough edges and slow moments.  In spite of this, however, they've pulled off an original, funny movie well worth the price of admission.  Be forewarned if you can't appreciate intelligent lowbrow humor, don't bother seeing this movie--you'll find yourself turned off faster than you can look down your nose.  Parker and Stone stick to their hallmark style for this entire movie, creating a delicate synergy of sheer puerility, genuinely sharp wit, and social commentary.  The sight gags range from standard slapstick to wonderfully contrived sequences of Goldbergian proportions; the humor stretches from re-hashed dirty one-liners to dangerously subtle quips you don't catch until the third time through the movie.The biggest disappointment of Orgazmo is not what's been put on film, but rather what's been put on the movie an NC-17 rating.  The Motion Picture Association of America really dropped the ball on this one.  The nudity was fleeting and non-explicit, the language is no worse than a typical PG-13 movie, and the entire treatment of the porn industry is done is a farcical vein--heavy on innuendo and hyperbole, light on actual adult content. Despite this, The film was given the dreaded NC-17 by MPAA, placing it as 'worse' than such classics as Basic Instinct, Body of Evidence, and a whole slew of other easily more objectionable movies.  Whether due to an archaic set of criteria, reactionary views of what constitutes 'suitable', bad blood with Parker and Stone, or some other reason, though, this movie was robbed of what could have been a great mainstream success, both critically and financially.  (On a side note, Parker and Stone are getting some degree of nose-thumbing in with their latest feature-length movie South Park, which farcically demonstrates the dire consequences of children sneaking into 'R' rated movies.)

And, in most cases, that expectation was probably ill founded.  You probably expect to see some SOmething About Mary rip off, or something in the Jim Carrey genre (pre-Truman Show).What makes Orgazmo funny is that it pulls no punches and maintains no pretensions.  It works hard to make you laugh and does not expend a moment of energy on anything else.The difficulty is that Trey Parker is a complete original.  He is also very young and without much experience.  What we are seeing in him and his partner Matt Stone, is the evolution of a comic genius.  Maybe they don't know how to write convincing characters, or how to make a full 90 minute film work entirely, but they have a unique and distinctive brand of humour.Orgazmo is far from perfect and belongs in the low-budget/indie category, but don't let anyone tell you that this movie isn't funny.

I saw both of these films for the first time in 2005, after I had just gotten into SP. The first one, Alferd Packer The Musical (a.k.a. Cannibal! The Musical) really disappointed me, but I found that Orgazmo, while definitely no match for SP (the show or the 1999 movie), was still pretty good. When I saw the first of the two last year, I still didn't think it was great, but thought it was much better than I did before. Now that I've also seen this one again, I can say I was still more impressed than I was when I saw its predecessor for the first time, but now think it's slightly inferior to Parker and Stone's first full-length project.Joe Young is a young Mormon missionary from Utah who is currently living in L.A., going from door to door and trying to spread the word of the Book of Mormon. Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to have any luck, never getting any respect. He comes to one house which he doesn't realize is the home of a porn director named Maxxx Orbison, who happens to be shooting a film inside when Joe comes to his door. The missionary soon finds himself attacked by men who were sent out to kill him for interrupting the shoot, but manages to fight them all off. Maxxx is impressed with Joe's fighting skills, and offers him the starring role in his latest movie, the role of a superhero named Orgazmo! The only problem is that appearing in a movie like this goes against Joe's beliefs. Still, he reluctantly takes the part so he can get enough money to marry his fiancée, Lisa, who is still in Utah, in a temple. He still doesn't know if he's doing the right thing, and tries to keep the movie he is doing a secret from Lisa. However, the young Mormon doesn't realize he's being used by Maxxx, and when Orgazmo turns out to be a hit, he is in for trouble! At the beginning, Joe Young (played by Trey Parker), along with a fellow Mormon missionary are going from door to door, and this part is generally amusing, especially when they come to an elderly woman's door, and she swears at them. When I watched the film last night, I was at least mildly amused for the most part, despite how juvenile much of it is. Joe Young doing porn, despite his beliefs, leads to some amusing situations. Other characters add to the humour as well. These include Dian Bachar's character, Ben Chapleski, who plays Orgazmo's sidekick, ChodaBoy, as well as Matt Stone's character, Dave the Lighting Guy, and G-Fresh, the sushi bar owner played by Masao Maki, who played the Japanese Indian Chief in Cannibal! The Musical. Not too many, if any, of this movie's gags could go down as classics, but many of them still made me laugh. Most of them didn't really put me off, though some of them did, such as three lame fart jokes, the T-Rex scene, and the closing sequence before the credits. I also didn't care much for the part where Joe and Ben go out with the Orgazmorator and start shooting it at people to see what happens. Mind you, what happens later in the film after they zap a guard dog with it made me laugh, even though I sort of got the feeling it shouldn't have.Despite what some people may assume, this is NOT a porno movie. It is a very crude comedy (as one would expect from Trey Parker and Matt Stone) with a lot of vulgar language and sex, but there's no full frontal nudity or anything. It's just barely more explicit than, let's say, an Austin Powers movie. However, it could still offend a lot of viewers, especially religious people, obviously including Mormons. Since it's from the creators of South Park, this shouldn't surprise anybody. Most of their material is not for those who are easily offended. If you're an adult and are willing to laugh at crude, juvenile, tasteless humour, Orgazmo could amuse you, though it could also disappoint you. Overall, I think this is a reasonably funny, extremely silly romp, and I'm not sure if I should rate it 6 or 7. The main factor of my 6/10 rating is probably the ending, which I'm not going to give away, but I already pointed out before that it was a low point in the film for me. Despite its flaws, I can think of how much worse the film would have been if Tom Green had made it!

I have to admit that some of the gags were just lame beyond belief and unbelievably cheap.  But this movie is able to rise slightly above the status of a hit-or-miss comedy, since there are more hits.  Even if those hits are somewhat predictable, I couldn't help but at least get a chuckle.  In that scene where Joe Young (Trey Parker) and his friend, both Jehova's Witnesses, show up at that old lady's door you pretty much know she's going to curse them out.  That joke has been used before and it lost its irony.  But watching an old lady use graphic language--I still had to laugh.  There are some things you just have to laugh at.I also liked the guy who played G-Fresh, the owner of a sushi/karaoke bar.  Another moderately cheap gag, but then again you can't but laugh at an ebonics-talking Asian man.  The NC-17 rating is a little extreme, considering the almost-childish nature of the film.  People expect something like Henry and June or some erotically-charged foreign film.  The sexual references and explicit language is rife, but it's nothing we haven't seen before; nothing to lose sleep over.  And for a film about the porn industry, there's very little nudity.  And the few nude scenes that we do see are for comic purposes only.  The same goes with the sex scenes.  Orgazmo is very low-brow and mildly forgettable, but it's fun.  It's simply a guilty pleasure comedy that is no Woody Allen flick, but it delivers the goods.  Trey Parker has done better.  His work with Matt Stone on South Park is much more memorable, but this was one of their first feature films, when they were struggling filmmakers.  And it wasn't bad for a debut effort.

Then as you watch it you may be pleasantly surprised for the first half hour or so and think this isn't so bad. But then as the movie drags on you'll find yourself thinking that, yeah, this is pretty bad after all. But it could have been worse.Plot really is not important here as the movie's only goal is to make you laugh, which it manages to do only sporadically. Anyhow the plot such as it is, features Parker as devout Mormon missionary Joe Young, who through a series of unlikely occurrences finds himself starring as superhero Orgazmo in the most successful porn film of all time. Orgazmo, whose weapon immobilizes enemies by giving them orgasms, has a sidekick, Choda Boy, who runs around with a dildo attached to his head. Yes, the cheese factor in this movie is off the charts. And while some of this cheese is initially good for a laugh eventually it all wears very thin. Maybe the porn world is just too bizarre but the whole thing comes off as incredibly awkward and forced. They're trying too hard to be funny and they're not succeeding. Matters are not helped by some less than stellar acting, most notably from Parker who as a live action actor...well, let's just say he's really good in his cartoon. Here, not so much. The rest of the cast is not much better. When Ron Jeremy gives the most convincing performance in your movie you've got problems. And yes, this movie has problems.

Sounds innocent, but come on, its a porno film with real porno actors (and I mean, REAL!) so whats a Mormon guy to do?

The humor in the movie is lopsided because while Trey Parker seems to know quite a bit about the porn industry, he doesn't know bean about Mormons.For a movie to be truly successful as a comedy of two value systems in conflict, it needs to thoroughly understand both.  I spent two years as a Mormon missionary, and everything about the depiction of the missionaries in this movie was off the mark.  Mormon missionaries spend 24 hours a day with their assigned companions; they do not live alone in separate apartments. Mormons use no iconography in their worship; Elder Young in this movie is portrayed praying to a Catholic-style icon.  And Mormons don't have to fork over a lump sum of $20,000 in order to get married in the temple; they simply have to being paying ten percent of their current income as tithing. And missionaries have no income.I don't object to Trey Parker's missionary becoming a porn star.  That's the comic conceit of the movie, and the situation that brings the two value systems into collision.  But I do think it was careless of Parker to use a Mormon as the centerpiece of the movie if they don't care to get the specifics of that peculiar religion correct.  A Catholic would have served as well in this context, or even a generic Christian.  To use a Mormon and not use him well is to weaken the strength of the movie's satire.  If only Parker had done as much research on Mormonism as he has obviously done on porn.But then again, maybe a porn star viewing this movie would say just the opposite.In short, Orgazmo is a pleasant enough diversion if you don't know anything about Mormons.

Maybe if you are a Latter-Day Saint, you may be offended, but the gentle joshing of the LDS church is the mildest jibe in the movie.  The porn industry gets more slams to its tarnished name than anything else in the movie.

I mean seriously&#133;.you would think after all the South Park episodes the guy would run out of comedy?? Parker just keeps chugging along, and he is getting better and better along the way.Writing, directing, starring, and singing the title song; Parker's Orgazmo is an admirable film full of senseless laugh out loud humor.Joe Young (Trey Parker) just wants to be a good Mormon and help others by doing what Mormons in Californian are notorious for knocking on doors and witnessing to any body willing to listen. Of course, as hilariously evident within the first 10 minutes, nobody wants to be bothered with outside spirituality in the comfort of their own home.When Joe wanders up to the house of porn producer Maxxx Orbison (Michael Dean Jacobs) he gets a little more than he bargained for. See, Max is shooting his superhero porn epic Orgazmo, but he's having a little trouble with his leading man. After watching Joe but out some righteous kung-fu moves on his bodyguards attempting to drive poor Joe away, Max decides he's found his new Orgazmo.Of course, straight laced and soon to be married Joe wants nothing to do with being in a porn film, but when he's promised a large sum of money to help finance his wedding, as well as guaranteed that he will have a stunt c**k for the sex scenes; Joe reluctantly agrees.During filming he meets his sidekick Choda boy (Dian Bachar), an oversexed scientific nerd who is more than happy working in the biz and running around with a strap-on di**do on his head as part of his unique costume.Joe and Choda eventually become buddies, and Joe learns that Choda has built the Orgazmaradar, which by simply firing will stop the toughest villain with pleasurable delight.Its all very silly, and very funny as well. There's a kooky subplot with Joe and Choda trying to save their favorite Sushi bar from Orbison's henchman; as well as the dilemma Joe faces when Orgazmo becomes a huge hit, spawning several sequels and leading his Mormon fiancé Lisa (a HILARIOUS Robyn Lynne Raab) out to California.Trey's talent is more than evident &#150; and Orgazmo is original and filled with plenty of tongue in cheek gags. Parker (who has openly stated that he despises actors) is quite a good actor and has an engaging screen presence all his own. Fans of adult slapstick should definitely enjoy.Recommended!

The plan is to remain within the spiritual restrictions of their rigorous religion, while seeking financial security. Unfortunately, they live in a fantasy world, as that's just not how the world works. When questing for money, you sacrifice your principles. How much, is determined by no one but yourself. But as I said; they are young and inexperienced in life's lessons.If you've a soft heart, this movie will surely hurt your feelings for the young couple.

It was a coincidence to find Orgazmo on R4 DVD during these days, of course I wanted to watch this film since I knew about its existence and frankly was a complete and pleasant surprise to find at my local store, was a total surprise because I wasn't even searching it. So I was excited and now I can say that I'm not disappointed at all, for sure the South Park film is better and there's no doubt about it but Orgazmo is hilarious and I just loved it. Trey Parker wrote, directed and plays the lead role Joe Toung. Joe like Parker came to Hollywood but unlike Parker he came from Utah. It is the encounter of two different worlds, there you have elder Young, a sane Mormon man who just want to make his missionary work but thanks to people like you (I hope so) and I he will just get insults. And there you have Maxxx Orbison (Michael Dean Jacobs), a director in the porn industry having some problems while filming his new picture Orgazmo so the last thing he would like to have in that exact moment suddenly appears. Did I mention that elder Young is such an amazing fighter? Well that's the connection, elder Young has what the actor playing the character Orgazmo doesn't so suddenly elder Young has the chance to gain thousands of dollars for just few days of work. It is hilarious watching elder Young in the porn set being witness of a DVDA shoot, basically being afraid by anything. He hopes that Jesus understand his situation because after all he is using a stunt cock and he is making a porn picture just for the money and for sure his fiancée Lisa (Robyn Lynne Raab) is very happy for the thousands of dollars. His fiancée is just like him so of course she doesn't know about the film Orgazmo even when it became a big hit, now children plays with their Orgazmo toys! But Lisa is from Utah. I watched Boogie Nights like 6 months ago if not more and I remember one of the many great scenes. I think is when the character of Mark Walhberg is filming for the first time, in that scene both but specially Julianne Moore made such a terrific performance since they basically acted as bad as the acting is in a porn film, truly great. In Orgazmo this is not an important issue, in Orgazmo the great stuff comes from the elements of the porn film they are making and of course from the things that happens during the filming. There's also a subplot that is about what elder Young and Ben Chapleski (Dian Bachar), who is playing the partner of Orgazmo Choda Boy, do together after the filming. This subplot eventually will show to us a real life Orgazmo and Choda Boy and is funny but not as funny as the stuff that happens in the filming. The crew of Maxxx Orbison is great, they see their director like a f****** genius and they, well actually just Dave the photographer (Matt Stone) are always very excited. Stone is hilarious and his character makes one of my favourites jokes of the film (the naked mariachis sound like Depeche Mode!). Ron Jeremy plays the nemesis of Orgazmo in the first picture (he has a really memorable scene near the end during the final fight!) but for the sequel there's a new enemy, one we don't know how Orgazmo can defeat. Fortunately when the real problems begin Orgazmo and Choda Boy had already being outside the screen, now L.A. has its Superheroes but also its new villain! Yes Hollywood needs Trey and Matt.Simply put &#150; IT'S JUST VERY FUNNY, yes I liked this film and I think I can watch it again some more times. Oh and I'm coping and changing a little the summary of user Bob the moo simply because I hate his comments.

It's the fact that it cannot be found in the big chain video stores. This is surprising since the movie got a NC-17 rating but has not nearly the kind of adult elements Scary Movie has (and that got the R rating somehow). The movie did not feature nearly what I expected it to have in the way of sex. In fact, the humor is a great balance between satire, slapstick, and intelligent dialog.Parker and Stone are obviously very creative, and I am not saying that as some fan of theirs.

The crude humor is exellent. But a few things. I saw it was nc-17, and i was waitng for some really intense content, and it never really happened. Sure it's crude and nasty and not for kids, but not that extreme, not that close really. The nudity isn't that bad, and the laugange is just as bad as the typical r film. It might be the weakest nc-17 movie ever. My friends and i rent two films that have a theme, and then we watch 'em. So we saw orgazmo with Flesh gordon 2.One thing, if you seen flesh one or two, you know that orgazmo is a rip off of flesh. Its the same guy.The costume is the same. The plot wasn't a rip off, just the charater. This was the r rated version of flesh gordon 2, and it really wasn't that much better in content. Flesh had bad lauqange also,nudity and penis shaped things. They didn't have as much scenes with female genital area, and mabey orgazmo was a NOTCH diriter, but if you don't want your kids to watch orgazmo, flesh 2  isn't really a good altertative.Example orgazmo has a scene with a guy with a penis on his head with a naked men(from the back) jumping on naked women. Flesh has a scene with a spaceship that fires a white substance on a another ship. i found both these pretty crude, but funny.You get the picture.Orgazmo was funnier then flesh 2, (flesh 2 was good, orgazmo really good) but you the content is not up thier to nc-17. The makers of the film got ripped off. (Flesh gordon 1 has more nudity than both these movies combined,even the r rated version!!!). But orgazmo  was funny as hell, mabey better than south park.

For the most part, Trey has used american pop-culture for his parodies. The action scenes in this movie were, for the most part, references to many a television show from the early 90s. The fight scene near the beginning where Trey uses Tai-Kuan-Do is definitely a reference to Power Rangers and other such action shows. These parodies sometimes made me cry because I was laughing so hard.Right from the opening credits, Trey Parker gets you going with his parodic voice and his band's great action-movie-theme parody of a song Now You're a Man, Man.As a kid who was raised in front of a TV, Trey's brand of humour completely suits me. And, although most of the humour is very easy to pick up on, some of it is very subtle. Watching a movie like this is also like taking a peek inside Trey Parker's life. He employed many of his friends from university in this film. Regulars from other films (CannibalThe Musical and BASEketball) are also very prominent. What would a Trey Parker film be without Matt Stone and Dian Bachar?I suggest that anyone watch this film, but I'm not positive that every person will enjoy it.

Now perhaps this movie would have worked, if it was a real porno with sex scenes. But unfortunately, it has no sex scenes whatsoever. On top of that, the plot is dull and the acting is terrible.It is the sort of film that gives even bad pornographic films a bad name. So if you are into the sort of thing that the creators of orgazmo are into, I would take a pass on Orgazmo and rent some other porno film, like Forbidden Science or Co-ed Confidential. You are your drinking friends will have a lot of more fun and your evening would not be ruined by this crap.

I started watching this movie already knowing it was going to be dirty, raunchy, and a bit on the wild side.  With that in mind, I was ready to laugh.  However, about every 10 - 20 minutes, Joe Young (a play on Joseph Smith and Bringam Young, two guys who started Mormonism) throws out some comment about how all of this is wrong.  How would Jesus benefit from me doing this?  And so on and so forth.  It kept making me think, umm...he has a point. For anyone with or without a sense of religion, the amount of comments made in this regard would start to effect anyone with a sense of morals into having second thoughts about finishing watching the movie.  This is why I say it is a self defeating film. In what began as a kick back movie to have some laughs ended up in feeling uncomfortable with the whole movie because of the constant reminders. However, all in all, with that aside, the movie really wasn't all that funny.  Maxxx Orbison was too outright profane and mean to be funny and made us wonder if this might be getting too serious. There were some good parts though, such as when they zap people with Orgazmo's working gun, (especially the dog, I got a kick out of that), and a few other scenes.  They were just too far between. In conclusion, the constant moral reminders of the film killed many of the laughs because we are reminded that we really shouldn't be laughing at that.  The laughs were few and far between and the film was much to profane to be all that funny.

Well seriously if you seen South Park you will know what to expect here.OK, now for the more serious review. Trey Parker is part of a comedic movement that began in the mid to late 1990s in America. They are not so much interested in messages but the joke. Nothing is sacred, nor is anything really reviled, they are just interested in the joke.Orgazmo is less a comedy about the porn industry but a comedy set in the film industry.Joe Young is a much reviled person on the grounds he is a Morman Missionary. By accident he enters the porn industry as Tom Hung, aka Orgasmo, crime fighting porn stay. But can he keep this identity secret and keep true his beliefs.Actually filmed in 1996 you see that Trey is still developing his style that doesn't quite hit the mark until the second season of South Park. Also, working alone (with a little help from his South Park co-creator) the story and ideas are leaner and more focused, with moral undiluted (South Park presents Morality as an ongoing debate...it is a Jewish thing I think).So what is the moral? If you play a role, that role will take you over? It is more sophisticated than that, it is that you will merge with the role and end up somewhere in the middle.Not a must see for anyone except South Park fans. However it certainly is entertaining and funny is a range of different ways.

So, I expected it to be crude and offensive (and it was). However, I also expected it to be really funny, as Parker's other projects (South Park, Cannibal the Musical, BASEketball and Team America World Police) are brilliant and hilarious. Sadly, the film mostly just succeeds in being very offensive--but not at all funny. It's a film filled with potentially funny situations but few punchlines or laughs.Parker stars as a Mormon missionary in Hollywood. He stumbles into the porno industry and soon becomes a sensation in adult films--though it never really made much sense why a committed Mormon would do this or why he was successful. Regardless, once in the industry, he only plans on being there a short time--but the evil man in charge isn't about to let him leave and resume his life in Utah. So, using an orgasm ray that his porn star friend, Ben, made, they wage a two-man war against evil. In many ways, the plot is reminiscent of Parker's play, The Book of Mormon, that has taken Broadway by storm--though Orgazmo is light-years different when it comes to laughs.The film is filled with ample adult toys and sexual situations, though not nearly as much nudity as you might expect--though it is still no exactly 'family-friendly'. But where is the humor? You might laugh a bit at the crude situations and toys but soon they become a bit tiring and the film never really seems brilliant or inspired...just rather dumb. My advice is stick with Parker's other projects. Even for a raunchy comedy, this one is pretty bad.By the way, Parker's South Park partner, Matt Stone, has a small role as a mullet-wearing idiot. Unfortunately, he's mostly wasted and his character comes off as very broad and annoying. I guess you can't win 'em all.

It has endless clothed simulated sex scenes with the only nudity being men's butts. I suppose it alright if you into that sort of nudity which I'm not. The movie tried to equate gross acts as being comedy such as overweight women and farting in peoples faces.The story line about am extremely devout Mormon being drawn into the adult film industry is to far fetched especially given that he is also a martial arts expert. The plot is extremely basic, good guy with friend defies bad boss who kidnaps girlfriend. Good guy and friend fight and win against bad boss and his henchmen thereby rescuing girlfriend. The use of sex toys as comedy is not funny and overdone such as the dildo lasso, dildo grapple and rope, dildo rocket launcher, dildo lock pick, dildo baton etc ad nauseum.The acting was extremely wooden and makes real adult movie actors look like academy award winners.

Parker and Stone's approach to humor is genuinely thoughtless, heartless and cruel, and I'm a devoted fan of Matt Groening, Seinfeld, Monty Python, and Looney Tunes - so don't tell me I don't know how to lighten up and laugh.Everything about this movie is revolting. Parker makes the pornographic material in the movie as revolting as possible in the spirit of his misanthropic attitude toward everything and everybody. Parker really misses the mark with his satires of Mormons too - he lazily spoofs the superficial television commercial image instead of the real thing.To top it all off, the movie takes so many clichéd twists and turns you swear you were watching a movie made by a spoiled ten-year-old with his own film studio and a very immature, naive attitude toward sexuality, comedy and life in general. Parker and Stone, unlike the ten year old however, have no excuse for their sophomoric childishness.

The idea of a nun demolition derby (no cars) is much more engaging than any actual cinematic expression of it. Most funny ideas are like this. On the other hand, the South Park episode where a kid wants pubes so buys them is so much funnier in its expression than its idea.The job of a comedian is primarily to understand the difference between the two. Trey and Matt learned the difference after this movie. Kevin Smith never learned. This a darned funny idea, but there's nothing funny about the movie itself. (Excepting a couple slapstick bits by Toddy Walters, someone who actually seems to have talent. Some sites other than IMDb have her as an editor on Thin Red Line!)Otherwise, the film is structured according to film school guidance introspective folding by a film about film-making.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

That's the sort of philosophical question posed by Orgazmo.Coming straight out of the brain of one of the guys who created South Park, Orgazmo is the story of Joe Young (Trey Parker) a young Mormon who desperately needs money to pay for his wedding ceremony in the great temple in Salt Lake City. He gets offered $20,000 dollars to star in a porno movie about a super-hero with an orgasm-ray and a sidekick with a utility belt of sex toys. He takes the job, on the condition that he never actually has to have sex with anyone. So, with the use of a stunt penis, the film is made. Then there's a sequel and something about the Japanese wannabe gangster rapper that owns the local sushi bar being menaced by some thugs, so Joe Young must become the super-hero Orgazmo in real life, complete with a real orgasm-ray. And his sidekick practices hamster style kung-fu.While it's filled with profanity and naked man ass by the metric ton, you shouldn't think that Orgazmo is anything like South Park Bigger, Longer and Uncut or Team America World Police. Those films, made by Parker and his partner Matt Stone, are really filthy but really, really funny. Orgazmo is funny at times, as it breaches all barriers and crosses into new levels of stupidity, but it is a bad movie. I t's badly acted, badly written and badly filmed. It barely even resembles a professionally made movie. It's closer to something a bunch of college students wrote one night when they were drunk and tried to shoot the next day when they were hung over.But absolutely every single bit of this movie's suckiness is 100% intentional. Trey Parker deliberately made the film in a crude and substandard fashion as part of the overall joke. But there's really no point to that joke, so you're just left with a stupid, poorly made film. I'm not sure if the problem is that Parker's humor doesn't translate to human beings or if it's that Orgazmo never tries to be more than funny. Both the South Park movie (censorship and personal responsibility) and Team America (American foreign policy&#x85;yes it was about American foreign policy) had themes of broader social commentary running through them. Orgazmo has none and perhaps that hollowness is what keeps the purposely lame humor from working.Oh, and a word of warning. Orgazmo definitely wins the award for Movie About The Porn Industry That Contains The Least Female Nudity, so don't rent it thinking you're going to get a cheap thrill.

What was really disheartening was the fact that it had a chance at the beginning after witnessing the cursing grandmother. But then, the film quickly fell into a dark gloom that didn't make sense and was barely coherent. I mean, the idea was certainly there, but it just failed to materialize as the jokes became extremely sparse and uneven. I will say this, Dian Bachar's performance was pretty funny. He actually put some heart into the project while Parker seemed to phone in the majority of his lines. Matt Stone also stole the show whenever his mop-headed face entered the scene.

I personally am offended by their constant mockery of religion, even though I do disagree with the Mormon faith. And their sick and disturbing fixation on sex and all things distastefully sexual make this film inappropriate for anything but private home viewing. Also, the constant use of profanity, (and I mean constant) shows that the writers have nothing to say and are either putting it in there for filler, or insulting your intelligence by thinking that's all you want to hear. Either way, it benefits nobody and adds nothing to the story. It shows bad writing.This is probably going to be one of the few films that I can review without seeing the whole thing.
