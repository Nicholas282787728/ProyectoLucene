[{"Title":"John Grisham, Francis Ford Coppola The Rainmaker has to be good!","Date":"17 June 2002","Score":"66 out of 71 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  A story about an aspiring young lawyer who tries to break down an insurance company, Matt Damon plays Rudy Baylor, a Memphis St. Law School graduate who can't seem to find a job anywhere, until he meets Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke). Stone is an ambulance chaser, who does whatever it takes, legal or not, to win a case. Rudy, as most law students are when they graduate, wants to take the high road, do everything by the book, and win. What he finds is that sometimes you need to get down and dirty to help your client. In this case, his client is a young boy, dying of leukemia. Seems the insurance company won't pay for a bone marrow transplant that would save his life. Rudy sets out to help the young man and his family, in what turns out to be one of the biggest cases Tennessee has ever seen. Along with his partner Deck Shifflet (Danny DeVito), Rudy sets out to try and prove to the world that the insurance company is nothing more than a big time scam artist. Along the way Rudy meets (and falls in love with) a young woman (Clare Danes) who gets beat up regularly by her husband. This part of the story seemed somewhat strange to me. I couldn't figure out what it was there to do. Was it to give Rudy a love interest? Was it just to give the movie another case so the entire film wasn't centered on the insurance trial? I feel it gave the movie some heart, and showed that Rudy would fight for what he believed in, both in court and in life. But I think the movie could have been done without it. I enjoyed the trial scenes and all the grunt work that went behind it (being a future lawyer myself (I hope)). And the cast was wonderful. Each person added a little more to the movie, and each gave a great performance. Danny Glover as the (2nd) judge gave a little humor to the movie, but also made you feel good about Rudy's chances in court. He was going to play fair, but hew as also going to give Rudy the benefit of the doubt. Jon Voight played the insurance company's lead lawyer, and he played his character to it's swarmy best. He is what people think lawyers are like, out only for money; win at all costs, no soul (I know attorneys like that). And he was convincing. And of course DeVito and Damon carried the film. I had my doubts about Damon playing a lawyer, but the more I watched, the more I realized that he looked like people I see at work everyday. He had the same fear in his eyes that we all do, but also that dog-eat-dog determination to prove to the world that he could do the job. The Rainmaker was more about the performances than the story. And the performances won me over. Give it a shot, it's worth it.

The story is that of a legal action on behalf of a teenage boy denied coverage for an expensive bone marrow transplant by his family's medical insurer. Changes to the plotline to accommodate the story to the demands of film drama have removed the unique feature of the book &#150; a largely successful attempt to make the details of legal civil procedure interesting. Francis Coppola is a very innovative yet conventional director (you could credit him with authorship of several current movie clichés) and his storylines develop according to convention. Thus the love affair, which is completely extraneous to the main storyline in the book, is pumped up, and the fascinating battle of wits between the lawyers played down. As in the book, Rudy is the tyro David up against the experienced Goliath, Drummond, but Rudy's inexperience is played up to the point that you wonder how he got this far. The trial judge, who in the book is extremely helpful to Rudy, is replaced in the film by a sympathetic but much more impartial figure. In Hollywood conventional courtroom drama, His Honor or Her Honor doesn't take sides.That said, there is much to enjoy. Danny de Vito, playing Deck the paralegal (or `paralawyer' as Rudy names him) who can't seem to pass the bar exam, is just brilliant. His Deck is a disheveled, unimpressive little guy who is nonetheless good at what he does, `rainmaking' or finding new business. His strengths are his intelligence, his energy and his lack of pride; he is quite happy to chase ambulances and give cops backhanders for information. His ethics are simple fight for your client, don't steal and try not to lie. While the Deck of the book verges on the grotesque, De Vito makes him less of an oddball and hence more sympathetic. Matt Damon as Rudy is wetter behind the ears and not such a quick learner as the Rudy of the book, but every so often he connects and we understand how he feels. Mickey Rourke is a bit too elegant as Bruiser, Rudy's erstwhile mentor, (who wears cufflinks on a tropical beach?) but it's also an enjoyable performance. Although the script tones down his role, John Voight is nastily urbane as superlawyer Drummond.Once again we have a courtroom drama filmed in a grand but gloomy courtroom, in fact the lighting people seem to have been absent. We hardly get a glimpse of the face of one important minor character, Cliff the wife-beater, (Andrew Shue) yet there is no apparent reason for this. The way some of the scenes were strung together, and started and finished were vaguely familiar, and half way through it hit me - ` The Godfather', where scenes just seem to begin and end without any particular reason.One thing the film does almost as well as the book is send the message (sorry Mr Goldwyn) that America needs to do something about its medical insurance system, if the present chaotic mess can be so described. The court system, while not perfect, comes out of it a bit better (David is able to beat Goliath fair and square) but as for lawyers&#133;well, let's just say things would be a lot better if they stuck to Deck's minimal ethics. The story also might explain why John Grisham (who has a walk-on role as a lawyer at an al fresco deposition) gave up the law to write books, thus bringing pleasure to millions instead of (hopefully) winning retribution for a few.  "},{"Title":"Rite de Passage","Date":"10 December 2004","Score":"35 out of 41 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" All cultures have what the sociologist Arnold van Gennep called rites de passage, also sometimes called puberty rituals, in which the initiate enters the ceremony as a child and emerges as an adult. Coppola and his team show us Rudy Baylor's rite de passage as an attorney. Matt Damon, as Rudy, is a fresh faced preppy-looking kid just out of law school. After working for the sleazebag played by Mickey Rourke and going into partnership with Danny DeVito (who has flunked the bar exam six times), he can look back down the slope and pick out the idealism he left sprinkled along the route of his ascent. He winds up quitting practice.But it's not a particularly gloomy story. I missed the credits when I first saw this so I had no idea who had created it. I expected a cheap ne plus ultra of mind-numbing commercial fluff. What else would anyone expect with a title like that -- John Gresham's 'The Rainmaker'? Shades of Sydney Sheldon! The opening didn't suggest much more than that. There is a voice-over by Matt Damon explaining his background and expectations to us. And we see him being guided open-mouthed through the slimier parts of the judicial system. DeVito introduces him, for instance, to ambulance chasing. Not too promising, really, because professionals who operate within heavily guarded social borders -- like lawyers, cops, doctors, and pilots -- almost always assume that the audience is too dumb to know that collusion between a judge and a prominent lawyer takes place. The lay audience is now cynical enough to recognize Perry Mason for the Norman Rockwell fantasy that he is.But it was much better than that. Half-way through I began to think, this director, whoever he is, is pretty deft. I was surprised at an undercurrent of humor. Sometimes it was situational. Two lawyers for instance, dashing into a courtroom to try a case, neither of whom has a license to practice law. (Sworn in by a fool and vouched for by a scoundrel, Damon muses.) Sometimes the humor requires less attention. (In the middle of a dramatic pause, DeVito, eager to deliver a piece of evidence to his partner, stumbles loudly over a waste basket.) And there were smaller, delicate touches. A splatter of blood spots on a wall as the camera cuts away just before someone is hit over the head. Damon and Claire Danes (with whom a love bond is too quickly established) in a prison visiting room, unable to express their affection because they are lawyer and client, except that under the table the tip of his shoe slips forward and brushes the tip of her boot. (Wow. Nice touch.) And Claire Danes' wife-abusing husband is a stereotype if there ever was one -- yet after his murder is discovered and the blinking screaming police cars arrive and she is about to be taken away, the wife-abuser's family can be heard in the background shouting, DAMN you, Kelly. What did you do? You killed my SON? Coppola and the writers have given this moron a previously unheard-from family of his own, and added another surprising dimension to his character.And I couldn't get over the performances. There are several unexpected small parts taken by well-known actors. And every one of them has a life of its own. Virginia Madsen is being interviewed in a motel room by Damon, and she spills the beans on the malignant corporate megagiant that provides the unoriginal heavy. As she speaks, she smokes a lot and the camera moves slowly down her arm to show her fingers trembling in her lap. Only later do we learn she has psychiatric problems. (Cinematic synecdoche!) Roy Scheider is extremely good too, a disdainful presence in the witness chair. He's from Orange, New Jersey. Why does DeVito so often seem to wind up in movies with other actors from New Jersey? What is it about that state anyway? Does the Jersey Devil have something to do with it? Why does hail always have to be the size of something else? If the universe is expanding, what is it expanding INTO? Anyway, this, for Coppola, is a pretty straightforward story, neither the grand opera he's attracted to, nor the more quiet personal films that usually come in between.I really kind of enjoyed this one. Of the current crop of younger actors, Matt Damon seems to me to have the most talent, as opposed to, say, Keanu Reeves. And Claire Danes is so frangible, so beatable in this movie; even with her leg in a cast and the rest of her limbs and head in bandages, she's morbidly alluring and radiates a sort of semisexual heat. Come to think of it -- well, never mind. See it if you can. It's pretty good.

It's not arty, there are no Corleones, there's really no issues to ponder long after the credits have stopped rolling. Instead it's a human drama that uses a courtroom battle as its backbone, but the entire body is the honestly-told if ultimately remarkable of a greenhorn lawyer trying to make a life for himself after law school. Like the more recent Garden State the movie is far more interesting than one would initially expect.I recently read the Grisham novel that the screenplay was adapted from and was impressed by the memorable cast of the characters. The corrupt-and-loving-it Prince and Bruiser, Deck Shiflett as the skeezy paralawyer who scrapes out a living with an amusing lack of self-consciousness, the bitter-tempered first judge and his pioneering, biased black successor, the politely patronizing and puffed-up Legal Titan Leo Drummond, Cliff and his straight-from-Deliverance hillbilly family, lonely and slightly bossy Miss Birdie, chain-smoking Dot and her addled husband, all of them set a standard for memorable but believable characters.Yet the movie is itself a cut or two above the original material. The extended cast does a hands-down fantastic job of bringing each character to life. First billing has to go to Danny Devito for transforming Deck from Rudy's unscrupulous and ugly sidekick in the novel, into a more take-charge and casually hilarious partner. Just take a look at the scene where he leads Rudy into the hospital or when he's giving out his card to the kids in Dot's neighborhood. But that's just one of about twenty stellar acting jobs. The extended cast includes Danny Glover, Jon Voight, Claire Danes, Mickey Rourke (yes!), Virginia Madsen, and a handful of other talented but lesser-known actors who show their absolute best through the skillful lens of Coppola.Besides the stellar job by the cast, the story is tweaked to absolute perfection. Whether it's the Coppola magic or an excellent adaptation and editing job, I see a transformation similar to his triumph with The Godfather an absorbing but complex and sometimes rambling story is condensed into its absolute essence. Not a single shot is out of place.Something else struck me about this adaptation -- it reminds me of Peter Jackson's LOTR in the way comic moments are used to balance out the weightiness of the main plot. For example in LOTR Merry and Pippin set off Gandalf's dragon fireworks, or in the second movie Gimli can't see over the parapet towards the advancing Uruk-hai, or in the third movie Sam and Gollum have their argument over the proper preparation of rabbits and 'taters and Gandalf instructs Pippin to keep his big mouth shut before they enter the hall of Minas Tirith. Likewise The Rainmaker has its little touches of humor as well, from the sardonic lawyer jokes in Rudy's voice-over, to the scene where Deck fake-helpfully hands over Drummond's lost shoe after he's been assaulted by an angry juror, to Rudy's red-faced apology to the car accident victim in traction whom he has accidentally jostled, to Madsen's laconic yet particularly devoted husband Bert. (Guess who DIED last night? ...Do you ever sleep?) There is anxiety during Kelly's return to her house, the suspense of the bug showdown, the pathos of Rudy's final speech all these combine with the lighter moments to balance each other like a film version of Pickapeppa sauce.Who could have ever guessed that a Grisham novel could be so perfectly adapted to the screen?! Just try watching the Pelican Brief afterward for comparison. My hat is off to Coppola, his cast, and everyone else who contributed to this understated masterwork.

It's just great storytelling, regardless.The film features a deep cast and one that puts on a great displaying acting, from the lead good guy Matt Damon to the lead bad guy Jon Voight to all the performers somewhere in the middle, headed by ambulance chaser Danny DeVito.It's not a believable story at all - a rookie lawyer fresh out of school outsmarting a team of proved veterans with big money backing them - but it makes for a good story. Everyone likes to root for David against Goliath, which is what this turns out to be. Just one example, by the way, of the political correctness in here the kid lawyer's hopes of a fair trial only become reality after the older, obviously-corrupt white judge suddenly dies and is replaced by Harvard- educated black judge (Danny Glover, of all people). Now, as it's quickly demonstrated in the film, a man of Liberal sensibilities will be bring fairness and justice to this case!The story is not flattering to lawyers, but it's not all-condemning either. It's pretty balanced in that regard. It's just good storytelling and, I might add, without much profanity. Damon does very well in this choice role and once again demonstrates why he is considered one of the best in the crop of today's younger actors. It helps that he portrays an extremely likable character, who not only sticks up for a poor, neglected family against a big, wealthy corporation but rescues a sweet woman (Clarie Danes) from her physically-abusive husband at the same time! Wow, he does it all SuperLawyer!Danes is very appealing as the battered wife who winds up being romanced by Damon. That part of the film is not distracting, but a nice break from the legalese of the main story. It helps make the movie even more involving. There is very little action in here but not much is needed to keep one's attention since it is so entertaining for the full 2-plus hours.

The cases vary from an old woman who is unsure about what to do with some money, a savagely abused domestic victim, and a lawsuit involving a major health insurance company.Writer-director Francis Ford Coppola and one of his writers from Apocalypse Now, Michael Herr, handle the adaption fairly well in knowing what to keep from the story in and what to leave out.  For someone who made himself a legend by adapting The Godfather and Heart of Darkness, Coppola sure knows how to use a novel as the main source for creating a good tale here.Plus, the movie has an excellent supporting cast (Danny DeVito, Jon Voight, Mary Kay Place, Claire Danes, Dean Stockwell, Virginia Madsen, Mickey Rourke, Roy Scheider, and Danny Glover) to be in the movie alongside Damon.  Among the ones that come to mind, DeVito is great Deck, as a crafty (and humorous) para-lawyer who has trouble with the bar exam and helps Rudy in adjusting to the line of work, Voight's fine as the not-so-totally slimey lawyer that Rudy faces in the lawsuit, just looking at the Danes character for a second alone, is a really sad and Rourke is amusing as Brusier, the employer that Deck and Rudy desert when they find out that he's the target of a federal probe.In conclusion, The Rainmaker may not be as highly memorable as The Godfather or Apocalypse Now, however; it shows that Coppola still has the skills to be a great film-maker.  It's nice to see someone who has been on hard times, bounce back with a good movie.

Coppola has directed movies like the epic mob masterpiece The Godfather and plenty of other great movies.This was released a couple of weeks before Matt Damon's huge hit Good Will Hunting, so this is one of his first big roles in a movie. Danny De Vito does a great job in adding plenty of humor to the movie, and Jon Voight adds a lot of dramatic effect to his character.The story follows a young lawyer who is representing the family of a boy with leukemia who could have had proper treatment, but couldn't because of a seedy insurance company. The movie pretty much follows the book, but the problem is that the book had a few great sub plots that seem absent from the movie, and one scene that happens in the middle of the movie happens in the end of the book.

If you can't tell which is which, through having-a-heart-in-the-right-place-on-your-sleeve film-making we will discern between the two and it will be easy going since this film is so blatantly manipulative you'd almost expect an alter call during the credits. The bad guys are the tall mean lawyers who have selfish irritating scowls and the camera will usually film them from below to make them look (and seem) more imposing. The will never smile unless it's a wicked smile; they are comfortable and rich and have nothing good about them at all; and their suits cost tons of money. The good guys are the poor people who make no mistakes except for falling into the bad guy's schemes, and who were born to be good and who are filmed from an equal level to make them look normal so to be on our, the viewer's, level. They will have tears in their eyes and will be a cross between a puppy dog and a deer caught in headlights IE, a puppy dog caught in headlights. Now in this film we have several good guys but the main good guy is Matt Damon, of course (who has the Tom Cruise curse of always having to be the good guy), who is liken to the civil rights lawyers that have never cheated on anything or anyone and who hate money and who take their 1/3 with a chagrin and are like John Edwards, rich and self-loathing that they just had to be rich like all the villains of society. But in this Damon is poor, and never had anyone to help him through life (unlike Sofia Coppola) and we even see him struggling to wait tables while an obviously snooty rich kid wants beer and is being overly rude. And he, Damon, even helps a fancy-fun old lady who is a religious dummy, although we can forgive her because her kid's want her money and she is a victim of the system, and Damon will show her the way eventually by being a good nice guy the way God would be if he were only a registered democrat and not so high and mighty. Then there's a poor girl who is beaten by a rich guy and the rich guy even beats her in the middle of a hospital, so that everyone can know that he's the bad guy and no one has to wonder about him like in most real life cases where a beaten girl has to seem like she's married to a great guy in public which would make her plight seem more of a&#133; plight to begin with. And of course this poor beaten girl is also very beautiful but you need to first remove the bandages and then when the beauty shines though she will of course have no love for her very mean hubby and Matt Damon's niceness will win her over in two-point two-seconds after they meet. And then there's Danny Devito's character who is liken to, say, Dick Morris when he was still a good guy and worked for Bill Clinton, Clinton who, it seems, this movie is subconsciously based because it's about a blonde nice lawyer kid trying to make good in a corrupted country. Back to Devito &#150; he is a bad lawyer but he has good intentions, that is, he is an underdog shark and eventually sees that the true sharks, Jon Voigt and company, are the really bad villains and that he is just a Mora-fish after all (I thought of him as 'the Prodigal lawyer'). And there's a kid dying of a terminal illness and we will get many shots of him bleeding and suffering to make us all hate the bad guys even more. And there's Mary Kay Place as the dying kid's mother who is the tried-and-true democrat type who probably loved Kennedy but in secret. And there's Mickey Rourke as the master corrupt lawyer but who isn't bad but seedy, and therefore we kind of like him because, after all, we are of the funny villains are really good guys mentality. But there's enough of Jon Voigt's one-sided evil character to hate and we can even hate Dean Stockwell as a sold-out judge, but then (another hero emerges) as Danny Glover replaces him as the good judge, and all the while he is rooting for Matt Damon over the villainous greedy insurance lawyers&#133; I mean after all, aren't all judges supposed to favor one side over the other and blatantly so? Well what can I say, this movie flows well and has some terrific shots and is definitely entertaining and has good acting, but it's so black and white you'll wonder if it's really in color at all. It's the kind of film made for a 5th grader who has to be shown over and over, again and again who the bad guys are just so the good guys can look even better than they do already, and for that this movie is a true marvel of film-making.Oh and there's Roy Schieder who plays the even badder bad guy (the Emperor to Voigt's Darth Vader), the owner of the insurance company that is out to rip off any and every poor person on the planet just to give the poor people's money to the rich (lawyers), sort of Robin Hood in reverse I guess; there are times when Roy's on the stand and his situation is so dire I keep hearing the 'Jaws' theme and I expect him to say We're gonna need a bigger courtroom. This movie will entertain you but if you have your eyes open it will also amaze you, the way it did me&#133; a person who doesn't need to be forced into discerning who is good and who is bad, as if there is really, in real life, any difference between the two other than your own particular point of view.

His books open the courtrooms to the masses, and allow the underdog to rule the day. With that said, not every Grisham novel is best told in the cinematic language. From The Firm to A Time to Kill and now to The Rainmaker directors and studios have tried to bring the elaborately well written stories to the screen with the same panache and excitement that is in the binded world &#x96; and yet every time, they fail. The films are entertaining, but after one viewing &#x96; the ability to view a repeat performance has lost momentum. Recently, The Rainmaker came across my DVD player, and I was forced to endure a repetitive story, one-dimensional characters, and a predictable ending that left me gasping for some originality. One must admit that Francis Ford Coppola does attempt to bring a level of authenticity to the screen, but it is the mediocre Matt Damon and the always odd Danny DeVito that force this film to flounder. Also, condensing a 443-page book into just over two hours is difficult. There is quite a bit lost within the translation, and The Rainmaker is no exception. From the lacking cardboard-esquire relationship between Damon and Claire Danes all the way to the less-than-exciting courtroom element, The Rainmaker struggles to hold on, and after 12 years, it just doesn't remain as pivotal as it once, perhaps, was.Re-watching this film for the first time in ten years, I wasn't expecting Oscar-caliber performances, nor was I walking in with great unrealistic hopes &#x96; which may be the reason it didn't further my desire to watch more Grisham adaptations. All I wanted from this film was an enjoyable two hours, but even that was a struggle. The beginning struggle with The Rainmaker comes from Coppola's choice of pacing. There is quite a bit of down time with this film, where we (as audience members) are merely watching small, unimportant character development that led nowhere. Damon cutting grass, hanging out in a hospital, asleep at his desk, or late for his most important case ever &#x96; are all within this film, but edited stronger &#x96; leaving these small unneeded bits out &#x96; would have tightened this story further. Coppola feels as if he has more information than this film can process within the time allowed. This hurts not only the film as a whole, but the individual parts (i.e. the characters, the tone, and the intended drama) as well. Because the editing was loose, we are lost when Damon heads to help his questionable love interest Claire Danes. We are lost as to the direction of Damon's relationship with Bruiser. We are lost as to the focus of DeVito's character, who represents himself as smarter than Coppola gives him credit for. So, to add to the mix of disheveled actors this plot that fails because of the lack of editing and character development, we have a sloppy film that is liked by too many.Plot. Aristotle said plot matters, and it should be believed that those involved with The Rainmaker should have paid further attention to this decree. The Rainmaker is a film about a newbie lawyer taking his first big case which is in essence the simplistic story of big business versus the little poverty of America. It is a strong beginning, but we loose focus when we add other elements that are never fully explained. Is Danes really in love with Damon who is portrayed as someone merely eager to help her, not fall in love? How influential was Bruiser to Damon's upbringing as a lawyer? Did anyone else believe that when Danny Glover was introduced as the sympathetic judge that this case was predetermined? Wouldn't anyone notice DeVito wasn't a lawyer &#x96; as smart as the defense was? Voight was slimy, but was it just his accent that made him that way? Then, we have the utterly realistic, but completely misplaced ending that felt cheap instead of honest. There was supposed to be emotion from the family who suffered the loss, but we are left with such little time dedicated to either side, that we just feel bored. Not a tear was struck with the emotion pulled out at the end, and I think that is an indication of how poorly Coppola directed this film.Overall, The Rainmaker leaves you with further disappointment than originally thought. A courtroom drama is always worth at least one slick move, at least one important cameo, and one highly emotional scene that leaves you with the impression of how good these lawyers and genre's can be. The Rainmaker had none of these. Scaling this film among those like A Few Good Men or even Grisham's The Firm, it falls well below. If you walk in with no expectations, than perhaps this film will uplift your spirits. Alas, for me &#x96; there was just a lacking plot, a terrible edit, and wafer-esquire characters that hurt the determined tone of this film. It was an embarrassing outing for Coppola as a director, but also the courtroom drama genre. There are better films that fit the bill out there, avoid this one.Grade ** out of ***** "},{"Title":"One of the best of the late 90's","Date":"10 August 2004","Score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Francis Ford Coppola's The Rainmaker is one of the best and most underrated movies of the 90's.  Of course the movie does not have the same effect and emotion of The Godfather or Apocalypse Now, but I ask you, what does?Spoilers IncludedThe movie stars a pre-Good Will Hunting Matt Damon as Rudy Baylor, an about to graduate law student who meets his future clients at a law workshop at Memphis State University.  Coppola efficiently sets up the meeting of the three clients during a montage very early in the film, and the three stories intermingle for the next two hours.  Meanwhile, Rudy has accepted a job with a shady, cufflinked lawyer who goes by the name Bruiser. Shortly after Rudy passes the bar exam, Bruiser's office is overrun by the feds for shady practices that are only explained by Bruiser's appearance and wardrobe.  So, Rudy and Deck Shifflet, played wonderfully by Danny DeVito, start their own law firm with Rudy's three cases.  The first case is a will for an old lady, named Ms. Birdie, and Rudy actually ends up renting a room in her home.  The next, more important case is the divorce of Kelly and Cliff Riker.  Cliff is a guy who uses his aluminum bat for more than just softball, and Rudy instantly feels a connection to Kelly, and wants to help her get rid of Cliff.Finally, the story of the movie revolves around the case of Dot Black v. Great Benefit Insurance.  Mrs. Black's son is dying of leukemia, and they are unable to afford a bone marrow transplant for him, because Great Benefit has denied their claim.  Rudy has obtained this case only because the Black's can't afford a lawyer either, and went to a law workshop as I mentioned earlier.The case sets up with the rookie lawyer going against the big bad insurance company and their million dollar lawyers, but the movie never really harps on that point.  The story is really about Rudy.  Throughout the film, he develops a relationship with Kelly, gets sworn in as a lawyer, tries his first case, watches Donny Ray Black wither away, and in the end, he prevails everywhere.The reason this movie works starts with the screenplay.  The people in this movie act and talk LIKE REAL PEOPLE.  The performances are solid all the way around with actors such as Danny Glover, Mary Kay Place, Roy Scheider, and Mickey Rourke all playing smaller, supporting roles.  In addition, Coppola made the excellent choice to let the story tell itself.  I recently watched Runaway Jury, another Grisham based movie, and that movie failed because it so desperately tried to make a political statement, that it just got silly.  In The Rainmaker the big insurance company is just as evil as the gun company in Runaway Jury, but here it works becuase the facts that just play out, and we don't need the actors to tell us who the bad guys are.Finally, the character of Rudy is a very interesting one because he is not the typical good guy lawyer trying to do the right thing.  He gets involved with each of his clients in ways that a lawyer never should.  He engages in jury tampering, phone bugging, and even gets involved in a murder.Overall, this is the best of the Grisham-adapted movies, and one of the best films of the 1990's.

Like Matt Damon in the Rainmaker I think it was the quote. I'm up for a good legal drama, so I seek to watch it (without actually knowing who's the director or the rest of the cast).Anyway, after 2 hours and 15 minutes this movie disappoints.It's unnecessary long for a rather simple story that it could fit nicely in a 45' minutes episode of a TV show, and it has no real thrills or interesting scenes. The material that you could build upon it, is there but the movie fails miserably to deliver.The drama is obvious but it doesn't build to a climax. The actual case as it presented in the courthouse it's boring too, and despite the effort of Damon to present himself as the rookie lawyer and Jon Voight's performance, you never get that sense of Davis vs. Goliath that this movie is all about.Sooo many good legal dramas and interesting and fun movies were shot in the 80s and in the 90s, but The Rainmaker is most certainly not one of them.

That is, here we have a somewhat sensational do-gooder kind of plot, taken from the Grisham novel, and a series of complications and good guys and bad guys fill it out. It's painfully predictable, and yet you are cheering for the underdog lawyers fighting the mean insurance industry and want to see how it ends. Even though it ends the way it has to.I love director Francis Ford Coppola's best movies. A lot. And I also wonder what goes on in his worst ones, where a personal indulgence gets in the way. Here I feel another thing kick in&#x97;mediocrity. Or fulfilling a contract. The filming is good of course, the mechanics of editing and acting are top notch. The music is a bit forced, however, and the pace is slower than necessary for the limited range of events that are shown. Matt Damon, years before his Jason Bourne stereotyping, is a recent law school grad who is instilled (according to a plain voice-over) with left-wing idealism. He falls into a shoe-string law firm with an oversized case. Classic David and Goliath. And of course he has setbacks and shows his naiveté, but perseveres, more or less, to the end (though the end itself you need to see for itself). Damon is very good. Jon Voight as the evil opposing attorney is even better, though with a more 2-dimensional role. What really pulls this movie into the mainstream in a kind of disappointing way is the way it is all told. It is what it is&#x97;well done but nothing more. It seems that the goal is to be convincing and entertaining. And so it is. Routinely. A simple comparison is Anatomy of a Murder which I guarantee Coppola saw before shooting this. The scenario is roughly similar&#x97;underdog lawyer against overpaid big shots, with a sidekick who does all the last minute investigative work. But Preminger (in this earlier film) had a whole bunch of things going for him that Coppola somehow skipped. First is an amazing rather than a decent leading actor (Jimmy Stewart). Second is a great score. Third is a plot that threw some real twists at you, including a defendant you didn't know whether to trust or not. Fourth you set it someplace really interesting, filled with quirks. And so on.So this movie, as solid (and stolid) as it is, just comes up short again and again. Enjoyable? Yes. As such!

When Kelly gives her sadistic creep of a husband the final 'coup de grace' and several dozen delicious moments with Danny DeVito. Devito joins the list of greatest character actors of all time - the ones who made the classic films so great in the thirties and forties. Mary Kay Place is outstanding but her artistry is so 'invisible' and perfect she becomes Mrs. Black and we forget to even think of her as an actor.This is my favorite Matt Damon movie and it is obvious that Coppola has a firm grip on all his 'mannerisms' and keeps him in the role. Matt has a bad habit of making bedroom eyes at everything in some films. Of course it is a treat to see the great Teresa Wright playing a affectionately written and performed portrait. Mickey Rourke was perfectly sleazy and had a voice like sin.The set designs are outstanding, especially the Black family home.

The story is intricate, weaving together its sub-stories. Francis Ford Coppola is in complete command of the material and his medium; he also did the screenplay based on the John Grisham novel. The movie is easy to take, although it gets somewhat one-sided or exaggerated after awhile in demonizing the corrupt insurance company. Taking place in Memphis, it presents a slower southern pace and characters, while maintaining the sharpness of their conflicts. The acting throughout is excellent. The characters are built up nicely. Coppola masterfully works in enriching details.Matt Damon is a really inexperienced lawyer who takes on an insurance case of large dimensions against a company in a wrongful death case. His main opponent is lawyer Jon Voight. Danny De Vito has a substantial role as Damon's street-wise and lawyer-wise partner after they leave the employ of Mickey Rourke. Known stars pop up frequently in this film in lesser but significant roles. Two judges are Dean Stockwell and Danny Glover. Teresa Wright is a widow who wants a new will who rents Damon a room. Roy Scheider is the CEO of the insurance company. Virginia Madsen is an important witness and former employee of the company. Damon finds a love interest in a battered wife he's defending played by Clair Dunes.Although the film runs over 2 hours, it holds one's interest throughout. I didn't find it particularly suspenseful, but its variety, star and acting power fully compensated. Some plot points are rather heavy-handed, but it has some heartwarming moments and some surprises. Overall the movie is rather laid back with a prevailing even tone to it. It's done as a wistful remembrance in the life of Matt Damon which gives it a coming-of-age character.This is a professional and smooth production that comes across as Hollywood and Coppola.

Those are just simply the most fun ones to see. The ones that do not deal with murder have to be extra great for everybody to like it. This is one that is simply that good without the need of murder. This is based on the 1995 novel by John Grisham of the same name. I'll have to admit, I did not like the novel. It was too boring with too many subplots and just dragged on about nothing. What Grisham bored me with, Coppola condenses in a way that I wish Grisham wrote in the first place. This features a star-studded cast (Matt Damon, Claire Daines, Danny DeVito, Jon Voigt, Danny Glover, Teresa Wright, Mickey Rourke, Roy Scheider) that is bound to make this movie that much more enjoyable. The movie is about recent law-school grad, Rudy Baylor (Damon) who is assigned to a case involving a poor family suing a wealthy insurance company for not paying for their son's cancer treatments. The company hires a high-power law firm with years of experience with very little losses. Rudy has never even been involved in a case before. At first, the lawyers make him look bad. Then Rudy slowly turns the tables on them as he shows what the company has really been up to. That is what makes the courtroom portion so interesting. A youth fresh of of school successfully files a lawsuit in such an exciting and believable way. But it is not realistic how he is assigned a high-profile case right off the bat. In reality, Rudy would have to work for years near the bottom of a firm and slowly get to the position he is at in the film. This is not as good as most of Coppola's other movies and not 1997's best. The acting and everything might be good, but a big chunk of the movie is so gloomy and dull. But it is better than the book. Luckily, it is one of those that gets better as the minutes go. Bit by bit, the case gets more complex and Rudy tries to save the life of a woman (Daines) who's in a stormy relationship with her husband, all which make the movie a very fine watch.

Additionally, Mr. DeVito and Mr. Voight should have received some Supporting Actor consideration.The film features many strong characterizations, with Damon's lead providing perfect counterbalance.

The characters played by Claire Danes (Kelly Riker) and Johnny Whitworth (Donny Ray Black) seem lacking - an additional scene or two, with Damon, would have been nice.

He directed near a dozen of films in the 80's and 90's, and probably the most acclaimed were The cotton club (1984), 'The godfather III (1990) and his adaptation of Bram Stroker's novel Dracula (1992). In 1997 he repeated a formula well known by him adapt a novel to the big screen. He chose a story about a young lawyer, Rudy Baylor (fairly interpreted by Matt Damon) and his first experiences in the law world. There are four topics I would like to talk about this film, The rainmaker (1997). (1) Direction by Coppola. As a filmmaker, he proved that he is still capable of telling stories combining humor, drama and deep emotions. Coppola is very skillful developing his characters and has the ability to select a good cast to work with. Besides Damon (who is OK in his role), the director selected professional and experienced actors to support secondary roles. Mickey Rourke (as the folkloric Bruiser Stone), John Voight (as the big firm partner, Leo Drummond), Dany Glover (as the sympathetic judge), Danny Devito (excellent performance as the almost-lawyer Deck Shifflett) and even in minor roles was supported by good actors like Roy Scheider (Great Benefit CEO), Dean Stockwell (as the corrupt and hard smoker judge Hale) and Virginia Madsen (Jackie Lemanczyk). Other good thing about the director is his ability to move the characters to the exact point where they deliver a solid and convincing acting performance, including young actors in main roles, like Damon, Clare Danes (as the beaten wife) and Johny Withworth (as the young character dying of leukemia). As I mentioned in the title, Coppola is still a good director. (2) The criticism against two major American institutions lawyers and insurance companies. As always, the poor and low income population is the affected. During the movie we can see what reality is along the land of opportunities big institutions and firms don't care about the individuals but for money. Individuals are only the means to get income, nothing more. There are interesting procedures used by the insurance institutions to get the majority of the income with the minimal expense (related with claims and reimbursements). In the other hand, lawyers are radicalized since the young and idealistic attorney through the experienced and money oriented firm partner. Every lawyer in the movie represents a kind of attorney and the different believes. (3) Stories developed. During the film we follow at least four different sub-plots the young wife beaten by her husband, the great trial against the insurance company, the tragic tale about a young man dying of leukemia and the old lady and her will. Rudy Baylor is personally involved in the different stories and we are moving from drama to romance, from tragedy to humor. Good combination and balance. (4) Finally, I would like to comment about Danny De Vito's role. With no doubt, is the best developed character of all. He is the responsible of most of the humoristic scenes but at the same time is the key element. He has a lot of connections, experience and non-sensibility manners to get what he wanted. De Vito developed his role with energy and comedy. He is the one that stole the movie for him self. Hope that Coppola has the opportunity to direct a few more movies like this. If well, The Rainmaker is not his best film by far, the picture is a good example of what he is still capable to do. I recommend this picture to see it, discuss it and have a good time.

There are tender and poignant performances by supporting players, such as Johnny Whitworth as the leukemia stricken Donny Ray Black. The role of Donny's mother is finely handled by Mary Kay Place, her naturally blithe spirit suppressed in a character of considerable depth and subtle inflection. Claire Danes as Kelly Riker, a stoic victim of domestic abuse, proves herself equal to any other working actress. Rudy's non-relationship with Kelly only magnifies the immensity of the fine young man's complete and total awesomeness. Eventually the increasingly manipulative story wears itself out, the mounting heap of standard courtroom drama clichés just too formidable an obstacle for me to navigate. This film had been drained of all its worth by the 90 minute mark, but there were still another 45 minutes of futile milking, such as the sudden appearance of a key witness whose insider information threatens to incriminate the evil large corporation. Virginia Madsen is convincing in the part, but her fine contribution is undermined by the film's insistently maudlin tactics. No sooner had she delivered her moving testimony - count to four - and the poor girl is exposed as the scornful rejected lover of the nasty company man. Her character is further impugned by her own admission that she traded sex for corporate privilege, but only because it was demanded of her. Even a perfectly green, wet behind the ears newbie lawyer would have sense enough to thoroughly check out a star witness' background, and if not Rudy then certainly the crafty Deck Shifflet. But Rudy's improbable incompetence was already established in his first appearance before a judge where he lacked even the slightest clue of courtroom procedure, despite 3 or 4 years of law school experience. Oh right, it was a modest, second rate, non Ivy League school. Maybe the school advertised on the back of match books?If Danny Glover as the mercifully decent replacement judge can't win me back into the film's corner then maybe a comically sweater-ed Roy Scheider can. He proves to be curiously entertaining, but his minor bit is too little too late to save this con job of a film that doesn't even have the decency to end when it's over.

I had never heard of Matt Damon before the movie came out, but I was quite impressed by his portrayal of a novice lawyer going after an corrupt insurance company. He looks like some teenage nobody, but he knows that he has to build up the will to do what's right. I will say that Danny DeVito came across as a little silly (he has a New York accent in Memphis, and there's the scene in the hospital), but his character makes it worthwhile.When the trial comes, one can feel every cast member's touch. Aside from Damon and DeVito, there's Jon Voight's menacing stare, Dean Stockwell as the judge, Claire Danes's waiflike touch, Mary Kay Place's sense of the baby boom entering middle age, and even Teresa Wright (in her final role) as the older generation slowly disappearing.

It kind of got lost in the wake of all the fuss over Good Will Hunting and the joint Oscar Matt Damon and Ben Affleck took home for that original effort, but I'm a big fan of this up to date Frank Capra like courtroom drama.The Rainmaker was a studio project as opposed to Good Will Hunting and it has an impressive cast list to support Matt Damon as newly minted attorney Rudy Baylor taking on a big insurance company in a big civil lawsuit. Jon Voight, Virginia Madsen, Bruce Willis, Danny Glover, Dean Stockwell, Roy Scheider, are all in this. Cast wise it is as impressive as that film adaption of that other John Grisham novel, The Firm, also by the way set in Memphis, Tennessee.But I think that the supporting cast member that really makes the whole film work is Danny DeVito. Dec Shifflet, para lawyer extraordinaire who hasn't come around to passing the bar exam, is absolutely sensational as the street smart legal eagle without a license whose street smarts are some of the best ever put on the screen. How he was overlooked in the Oscar sweepstakes in 1997 is beyond me.The Rainmaker marked the film farewell for Teresa Wright who plays Mrs. Birdsong, Matt Damon's landlady. Matt cuts Teresa's lawn on the weekend and writes her will in his spare time. By the way, check the scene where he handles Teresa's inquisitive son. Matt wasn't totally without street smarts himself.The main plot is involving the suit of a young man, dying of leukemia, who is suing his medical insurance carrier because they would not approve the treatment needed to save him. It's a story that Frank Capra would have jumped on during his career. Young idealistic attorney takes on insurance company in his first trial. The insurance company and their hired legal guns headed by Jon Voight. As you watch Damon in court you see the faint shadow and hear the faint echo of Gary Cooper or James Stewart. But even those guys had some help from the Danny DeVitos back then. Good to have at least one savvy rogue on your side.The Rainmaker is good courtroom drama and there isn't a player going that doesn't want one of those. And here Matt Damon got it in what was his first starring role. How better to begin a career. "},{"Title":"Enjoyable, entertaining and Damon carried it.

Exciting stuff with a pleasing if slightly simplified end, but a entertaining law-procedural plot. Enter, the amazing acting talent of Matt Damon. He was excellent in this film, measured, quietly strong and believable up against the arrogance of his opposite number Jon Voight for the Insurance Company. Also, Danny DeVito was good, and he and Damon seemed to work well together. Some of the make up special effects were a little poor. Aside from the main characters, some of the acting wasn't deep or developed enough but were generally good but the actual production of the film was lacking something. The sound quality was bad, there seems to be pauses in the action, and some continuity and pacing issues. The film feels amateurish and low budget. Coppola, who directed, clearly wanted a grim and grey feel to the film, which I think he achieved but it didn't make it look that good. However, it is Damon and DeVito and the story that carries this film and that is what you are invested in with a John Grisham film. Definitely highly entertaining.

Well directed by none other than Francis Ford Coppola, The Rainmaker tells the story of a rookie attorney who goes up against a corrupt insurance company that sold policies to poor people that they never intended to honor. Damon, who plays Rudy Baylor, represents a family whose son is dying of leukemia because the insurance company refused to pay for a bone marrow transplant.This is a great story that has the usual Grisham touches the corrupt big law firm, the honest attorney, big stakes, David versus Goliath. The only problem with this film is that the company and the attorneys on the other side are almost cartoonishly evil, corrupt, and uncaring. Not that they don't exist, but perhaps if they were less obvious, the story might have been more believable. There's a subplot of Rudy's involvement with an abused wife (Danes), which gives a break from the main plot.The acting is excellent all around in this powerful story. Damon is totally natural as a quiet yet passionate young man in way over his head; DeVito plays his partner who has failed the bar five times - he's a riot; the over-plasticized Mickey Rourke brings glamor and likability to the part of The Bruiser, the attorney under FBI investigation that Rudy originally goes to work for because he can't find another job. Dean Stockwell plays a sick judge in tight with the insurance company's lead attorney (Voight) - between his coughing and pill-popping, Stockwell gives a highly entertaining performance. Mary Kay Place is a standout as the boy's mother, poor, dignified and devastated, and Red West is heart-wrenching as her gin-drinking husband whose grief has rendered him nearly speechless. Johnny Whitworth does a beautiful job as the son. There is top-notch work as well from Teresa Wright as Rudy's landlady and Virginia Madsen as an ex-employee and witness. Voight's good old boy slimeball attorney is great, but as mentioned earlier, the role is written to give him not one redeeming quality.The Rainmaker is well worth watching. It really grabs the viewer's interest, has another nicely developed performance by Matt Damon in the lead and a powerhouse supporting cast.

The company refused to honor a claim for bone marrow work for a young man from a (decidedly) working class family in Memphis. Can Matt, and his sidekick, Danny DeVito assemble a winning case when facing a high-powered, ruthless defense team led by Jon Voigt? You might say that 'life imitates art' -- Michael Moore's scathing portrayal of the Insurance industry in 'Sicko' makes the unflattering portrayal of the offending company in this story seem even more fitting. Of course, Grisham was writing primarily about the legal profession, and the slippery slope that entraps its members into trading ethics for cash. Do these arrogant corporate lawyers need to be taken down a peg or two?So, we have a great courtroom drama, fine support from a very young Claire Danes, terrific work by a youthful Damon and a seasoned DeVito - (the success of this script depended largely on good chemistry twixt the two), a couple of genuinely funny bits and some interesting insight into the Ol' South that Grisham seems to have picked up along the way.Btw I watched two Damon flicks today Ocean's-Eleven and Rainmaker.

A lot of it takes place in a courtroom to be sure and it's focus is lawyers but more then anything else, it seems it's purpose is to engross and draw you in, and that's done by telling the story of the characters themselves rather then manufacturing false tension. I really liked this movie a lot and found it to be a must see for any fan of (for lack of a better term) movies about lawyers and Courtrooms.The way Rainmaker plays out, your not ever bored and are interested from the beginning in the lives of the main characters. Damon was the perfect choice for the role of idealistic lawyer, I liked how the movie was able to show the humility of many of these people in a way that never seemed contrived and always remained interesting. The casting choices were close to perfect and everyone from Damon to Devito to Voight and Danes were great. So were the supporting cast, Marykay Place, Virginia Madson, I could go on. The movie, even though it had a lot of big names in it, never seemed all that commercial. Although Damon's character was so likable you could really see where his character could have his own television show....Although the subplot with Claire Danes was good, it was overshadowed by the insurance company story. That's not the fault of Danes who is great in everything I've seen her in, but her story is not given as much screen time and builds to quickly but then again had the whole movie just dealt with that one case with the insurance company that might have been just to much.Rainmaker's strength was not selling out in a sense. Even the ending made sense, because while Damon won his case, the company went belly up etc etc. It didn't just end with the jury coming in and rendering a verdict. And the narrating went well with this also, because even though I don't always like that in a movie, it fit here and was done very well by Damon.I'd give this movie a solid 8 of 10. It was quietly powerful. And it was very good.

I've never read one of his books but having watched a few of the movie adaptations of his novels, I almost feel I could write one. All you need is an idealistic central lawyer, confront them with a big moral dilemma, close with a big courtroom scene and simmer but never quite bring to the boil.Matt Damon is the youthful unsullied hero here who belies his poor-boy background to try become a solicitor but who has to compromise his moral standards in starting up with a crooked ambulance-chasing litigation practice barely one step ahead of the law. There he's paired chalk and cheese-style with seen-it-all para-legal Danny De Vito and gets involved in not one but two cases which stretch his honesty and integrity to the max, one involving a law-suit against a mega-rich private medical insurance company denying a dying leukaemia victim his due pay-out and the other a cuddly old rich granny trying to stop her grasping kinfolk from getting her money when she expires. Along the way he also somehow manages to get romantically involved with a young battered wife.To be truthful, there's not much to get excited about here, the drama fails to grip as a thriller and the supposed feel-good sentimental climax underwhelms too.Damon and DeVito are okay in their stereotyped parts and Jon Voight gets to roll his eyes and chew the scenery as Mr Big Bad Corporate Lawyer. The only surprising thing about the whole movie in fact is the dull TV-movie type direction it gets from none other than Francis Ford Coppola.

These reservations come with the territory though, and really come with any drama set in the court room, which is the simplicity of the little guy having to go up against an overwhelming force that pays its lawyers a thousand dollars an hour. Maybe not all court dramas, but I'm reminded of not just a possible Law & Order episode pulled out of a hat, but Lumet's the Verdict, and several other contemporary court story, however with circumstances shifted and the charges greater or lesser. Such is the case though with the 'overwhelming force' that in The Rainmaker comes with Great Benefits, an insurance company that denies claims made after their clients have already been duped into signing up for their company. And so Matt Damon, as Rudy Baylor, faces off against the company- and their main player Drummond- and added on top of this is the fact that Rudy, just out of law school and passing his exams, is on his first case.While he doesn't have the kind of personal baggage and demons that Paul Newman's character had in Lumet's film, Grisham's story gives Baylor the problem that comes with his 'love interest', played by Claire Danes. But it's a strange love interest that starts up, as he sees her as the victim of spousal abuse- triggering his own past of being in such a household- and it becomes a sort of tense situation that comes to a high peak with a really well done attack scene at night (it's strong precisely because Coppola, no pun intended, pulls no punches with this fight scene, as it's really graphic in how far it goes into the terror of a domestically violent climax). Aside from that, Baylor is really just the typically courageous young man looking to make the other side that he can't stand get what's coming to them- the other side being the lawyers he once thought just wouldn't accept him and realizes are just foul in their own manner. So the case then unfolds, in the sort of traditional Grisham style (if you've seen other Grisham thrillers or read the books you know what I mean), and of course one can sense the outcome a mile off.So why then is the Rainmaker so impressive if it seems to be bound by conventions of David more than likely conquering a Goliath (or would-be Goliath in this case)? More than anything because Coppola trusts that the audience will take this as a Hollywood picture, and almost something of an 'old-fashioned' one, so to speak, with some of the supporting characters sort of out of the ranks of past films (Teresa Wright is one of them, in her last role, as the old lady who lets Rudy have a room to rent out during his trial). Coppola also, with one exception, doesn't get in the way of telling a story that at it's core is entertaining in its simple form of the right versus wrong and the injustice of malpractice and greed being outshone. This exception is probably in the narration by Rudy, which is sometimes effective, but sometimes is also a little overbearing and- considering it's from Michael (Apocalypse Now) Herr- tells too much where Coppola could just as well show. But aside from just getting down a technically proficient and occasionally slick drama/thriller, he casts terrifically, more than just type, as to all of the actors given their strengths and nature.Jon Voight is in one of his better roles in recent years as the dangerously smart and smarmy lawyer for the company; Mickey Rourke comes off quite well in his few scenes as a 'shark' lawyer type (the kind that doesn't stick around for the trial, as he's away somewhere nobody knows after a corruption scandal); Danny Glover as the judge, convincing without trying much at all; and smaller parts from Virginia Madsen (she might be my favorite, as the disgraced ex-employee of the insurance company) and Roy Scheider are made totally fleshed out through Coppola's direction and skills as a dramatist. Danny De Vito, however, makes his mark here more than anything, and is a great counterbalance to Damon's young and scared/confident lawyer. There's even some sweet bits of light comedy that get put in, not much but just hints, at the charmingly sneaky ways that De Vito's not-quite lawyer character has. In the end, the ensemble really forms with the material, and it's ultimately a very watchable couple of hours. It might lack the harrowing impact of Coppola's best, to be sure, yet I would not think to pass it off as just a studio assignment either. He takes the material and his actors seriously, and it's a fine picture content to be itself- heartstrings and all- which may appeal to some more than others.

In The Rainmaker Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon), just out of law school, is hired to work in an office that chases ambulances. He works with Deck Shifflet (Danny DeVito), who is considered a lawyer wanna-be. He knows the ins and outs of being a lawyer, but has yet to pass the bar exam after six failed attempts. Rudy and Deck end up at the hospital looking for possible clients who might be potential clients. They sign up this new client and Rudy meets Kelly Riker (Claire Danes), who currently resides in the hospital from a beating from her husband. Rudy is assigned various cases to handle. One case being a new will case, and a lawsuit against an insurance company.Kelly Riker is a victim of abuse from her husband and of the system. She has been in the hospital on numerous occasions from being battered. Rudy and Kelly eventually click, and he tries to come up with ideas to help her leave her husband. Kelly did not leave before, because she is without support and her husband threatened to kill her if she ever left him.After leaving the hospital, Rudy eventually ends up on the doorstep of this elderly women's house. The woman wants to change her will. Her kids want her to leave them all of her money and she wants to leave all of her money to a church that she sees advertised on the TV. Rudy ends up moving in with her and helping her with things around the house. Rudy's first big case is about an insurance company which refuses to pay on any claims. The company's first mistake was not paying the claims. The second would be calling the client's mother Dot Black (Mary Kay Place) stupid. The third mistake was thinking that they could get away with it and trying to over power a new attorney. The case takes a dramatic turn for the worse when the complainant dies of leukemia. The case is now a wrongful death. I like this movie due to the everyday topics which they went over. The fact that they showed a little old woman trying to decide what she wants to do with her money and possessions. Those showing the kids trying to butt in, they are not nice kids, but in their minds they feel that they have earned it. She's not dead yet. I appreciated them showing a young man helping an elderly woman with everyday common housework.Claire Danes shows that when the system won't work, sometimes we have to escape. Matt Damon played the part of the overprotective lover shows through. This is a topic that is not discussed enough in today's society. It is more or less ignored until it happens to us or our loved one.I think that movie showed that there are cases as such that women cannot always leave their abusers. More times then not the system does not always work for them. The main part of the movie being the big lawsuit against the door to door insurance company. In today's world most people after so long would just give up and find other alternatives to taking care of medical expenses.With the insurance company, director Francis Ford Coppola shows a new attorney fresh out of law school, coming up against this big insurance firm and a big hot shot lawyer. Danny Glover playing the part of a judge had a good kick to it too. The judge actually giving the kid a break and allowing more time, and cutting the kid a break in some instances in trial. This movie shows that sometimes we can beat all odds and win against that big company.

The inexperienced lawyer (Damon) get help from a not-really-lawyer Deck Shifflet (DeVito) that is more accustomed to the brutal war that is trial. Together they fight experienced top lawyers and the system on the edge of the law. To complicate matters more Baylor get involved with the drafting of a will of his landlord and a young beautiful girl, beaten up by an abusive dangerous husband.Now, one should remember that movies and books are completely different medias, so that a story told in a book are impossible to tell in a movie without some changes and cuts. That is the ground rules when adapting a book to movie. In many cases the story get hampered and incomplete in the movie-version but this is not so in this case. Of course, there are some big time cutting in the story, mainly in background descriptions and subplots that are not essential to the main story. However, the writers and directors have still managed to capture the essence of the story while managing to both keep major subplots and not do an movie that go on forever. By some quick scenes, cuts and hints the audience is easily able to put together a complete and fascinating story. Nice work.The story in itself is a version of the classic little guy from nowhere fighting the big system that keep to protect themselves and their profits no matter what. It is a long struggle for poor Baylor but the journey is eventful and entertaining to follow, as new turns and subplots appear and resolve. Damon does an good but not great work with his character, DeVito instead does a really good job with his slightly minor role as Shillet. Th opposition is lead by a Drummond, which Voight portraits with skill even if he as Damon does not bring the performance to any great heights. The real credit here should go to the people in charge of casting along with the director. Damon as Baylor, Voight as Drummond, Danes as Kelly Riker (the beaten girl) and Whitworth (as Donnie Ray Black, the sick son) is very good choices for those characters, both in physical appearances and acting performances. Even Danny Glover (uncredited?) does a nice role (without sending out any Lethal Weapon wibes, nice) out of the presiding judge (a role rather cut in the movie compared to the book). The ace is however DeVito as Shillet. Perfect choice.So, if you like criminal drama, with some traces of action and comedy, this is a movie for you. And if you like the movie and haven't read the book, I strongly recommend that you do so as the story will evolve even more.

He receives legal assistance from Danny De Vito while Jon Voight plays the opposing lawyer. Interesting theme regarding dishonesty and truth among lawyers however, it is too predictable and structured like a courtroom drama. Director Frances Ford Coppola does his best but this hardly matches his work in The Godfather, The Conversation and Apocalypse Now. Damon is superb as this new attorney setting out to make a difference. De Vito steals scenes as he stoops to whatever level to achieve victory. Voight is standard issue as the opposing lawyer. Claire Danes is unnecessary as an abused housewife whose presence is basically to involve Damon in a romantic fling. It slows down an already boring film. Mickey Rourke also makes an appearance as a corrupt lawyer, as if that is beneath anybody here. Coppola is a terrific director doing work here that is far beneath him, with stars that are above it.

Mickey Rourke as a Greedy and Slimy Lawyer who gives Matt Damon (The Moral Center) His first job working strictly on commission. Danny Devito may be the Quirkiest as a Paralegal (flunked the Bar six times) but provides the Humor in the Rather Depressing Reality of the Commonplace of the Corrupt.

The movie is centered on the difficulties this young lawyer has to face to get things done. He has to avoid speaking on the phone in his own office in order to not fall in a trap from the adversary attorney. What amazes me about this film is that, even thought there were thousand of courtroom dramas in the nineties, The Rainmaker was able to show a story not so clichéd, like the innocent who goes to prison due to a conspiracy-- which would feel extremely cliché nowadays. Also, the entire cast looks prepared for their work in here; Danny DeVito, in fact, almost steals the show with his brilliant performance as a paralegal-- who acts like a lawyer sometimes, even if that's illegal. Furthermore, albeit the movie takes more than two hours to tell a story, it never feels tiring or repetitive, which is common in the genre. The problem involving health insurance companies is still very common, inclusive in Brazil, and we are all tired of seeing such lack of respect with the consumer. I'm just not giving it a better rating because the subplot involving a beaten-up woman didn't feel pertinent with the movie as a whole. I mean, if director/editor decided to take those scenes off, they would make NO difference to the main plot, so I sometimes wondered what was that all about. All in all, The Rainmaker is a decent production from the good decade that nineties was in movies, and I surely recommend it for anyone who enjoys the genre!

It is extremely forward thinking for its time.The Rainmaker, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, wasn't a beautifully shot movie but it was executed well. This film holds up as it does not feel dated like many movies released around the same time. There are some movies you can tell when they came out and this is one of those films that ages very well as are not many outdated styles shown and the film was shot in a way that doesn't feel dated. By that, I mean that some movies released around that time had the same feel to them and this one felt much more like it was being played through a storyteller's eyes. There wasn't much flair involved in the filming but it didn't need that. Nothing was creative about the way it was shot but it worked.The casting of this film was great as each player delivers a fantastic performance top to bottom. A perfect example of this is that Dean Stockwell is only in this film for a short period of time and he delivers quite a performance given the limited amount of time on screen. Matt Damon works as the do-good attorney in a sea of snakes. Danny DeVito is about as good as he gets in this film. Coppola could have done a bit more with the framing of the film to work with DeVito's size but that is the only problem with the performance.The movie isn't perfect because there are quite a few issues with certain lines and regardless of how good DeVito and Voight are, there are some cheesy and predictable lines that they are forced to deliver that drag the movie down a little. The film could have done more with the given novel it had to work with but there is only so much that can be done to adapt a novel into a film. It will never be a perfect interpretation of the novel unless this film was done in the same way as The Stand or The Hobbit. You cannot please everyone and I think The Rainmaker did a good job with this story.

The film is based upon a best-selling novel by John Grisham, and strangely, nowhere in the film is there any explanation of the meaning of the title, which I presume must have been clear in the original book. The screenplay is by the director, Francis Ford Coppola. I believe it is one of his finest films. Coppola has always been a good screenwriter, and he has crafted a fine screenplay and directed it magnificently. John Toll's cinematography is as usual excellent. The film is notable in retrospect for the appearance of the 18 year-old Claire Danes, long before HOMELAND had ever been dreamt of. She was pretty and talented then, as well as now. The film was also the occasion for the last film appearance by Teresa Wright, bringing to a close 56 years of inspired screen acting. The lead role of the young lawyer who decides he is going to fight corruption is played by Mark Damon, who really is a very fine actor when he is not too busy leaping from rooftops and helicopters in those endless Bourne action movies. The film is a powerful and gripping 'David and Goliath' story, with Matt Damon fighting the forces of corporate evil against all the odds. Jon Voigt is magnificent, giving one of his finest film performances, as the oily lead lawyer of a corrupt insurance company. Danny DeVito is marvellous as a legal assistant who bends all the rules to 'get' the bad guys. This film is, as I have said, more relevant now than when it was made. In the light of the Obamacare train crash, and the loss of insurance cover for millions of people through the sheer idiocy and perversity of the Obamacarrions, this film speaks of yet another angle on the desperate problems of people being deprived of their insurance and left helpless as they lie dying of fatal diseases, with their deaths hastened by the lack of treatments which could save them.

It was amusing to see him struggle, and Danny DeVito's character seemed to drive the picture. The plot was on the weak side of things, and it was tame for a John Grisham story. I was also expecting more out of Coppola post-Godfather.I'm glad that the good guys win and everybody feels better once the evil insurance company goes bankrupt. It was heartwarming, but I was expecting more intrigue and suspense. When it didn't come, it made Rudy's narration unnecessary and irritating. Danny Glover felt miscast as the judge, and Jon Voight wasn't allowed much time to shine. I was expecting an intense scene between him and Damon once the lawsuit intensified. The romance felt superfluous because the scenes with the Black family and the old lady show that Rudy cares about people. It was time better suited for conspiracy and chaos, especially since it all seems pointless as the wife gets spared by the DA.Rudy's buddies kept telling him to be careful, but I was left asking why because the bad guys only seemed to care about winning the case as opposed to escalating things with violence like any other Grisham story I've seen. I initially thought Bruiser (Mickey Rourke) would be the antagonist with something to hide, and frankly he was more intimidating and interesting than Great Benefit Insurance.However, it was still enjoyable.

Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is a young lawyer straight out of law school and desperate for work. While learning the legal ropes under a crooked lawyer, Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke), Rudy takes on the case of Donny Ray Black (Johnny Whitworth) a young boy stricken with leukemia and his medical claims denied by his insurance company.What follows is a typical case of the little guy vs. big corporate greed, but what makes the story watchable and not cliché is the wonderful cast and acting. The players include John Voight as the sleazy corporate lawyer, Dean Stockwell as the corrupt judge in the pocket of the corporate world, Danny DeVito as Matt Damon's legal assistant/would be lawyer that can't seem to pass the bar exam, and Danny Glover as the anti-corporate judge whose rulings help Matt Damon bring the case to trial.The movie does a good job of presenting the ebb and flow of the case, he audience's opinion of guilt or innocence sways with each new witness and legal maneuver, until the final bombshell is dropped and the case is easily decided. To sum it up, the story is a bit cliché yet well told, the characters are similarly cliché yet well acted, and the ending is typical of Hollywood yet rewarding.

Yes, because it is a thriller in the courtroom with a judge and lawyers and cases, victims and culprits, a jury and all of it. But it is more than that. It is the dilemma of a young lawyer who is confronted to an impossible choice he is getting involved with his clients, emotionally involved and that is not good. You can't be the lawyer of the woman you love. You can't be the lawyer of a young man who is dying of leukemia and for whom you feel too much compassion. But that problem is secondary in that film, though it explains the end, the very final scene. This film is essential because it deals with three cases that are absolutely typical in our society. The first case is an old woman who has an important inheritance and she does not want to give it to her own son and his wife because they hate her and they only want her money. That's about what we do with our senior citizens, and what they do with themselves if they still have that much control of their future. Then let the lawyer write the will. Then you have a young married woman who is systematically beaten up by her husband and she does not dare to get a divorce because she is afraid. Then the lawyer is the only recourse to convince her she has to put an end to that situation. Then there is the central case, that of the young man dying of leukemia because his insurance company denied the claim. In that case, and that film is not quite young, we have all the arguments we have been able to hear against any kind of public management of health insurance coverage. That case was representative of the debate that had been going on for decades, since the war, since the new bill of rights of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944. Public health is a national asset and the nation through its representatives is entitled to manage it for everyone to have access to the best health coverage possible. Along that line the film is extremely emotional, even passionate and the arguments are no longer important when you are dealing with the pictures of a dying young man, of a beaten young woman, of an old hated woman. But the film is effective and calls for a response from the audience. It is that direct address to the audience's feelings and emotions, other than fear, fright and dread, or horror, terror and phobia, or violence, brutality and fury, that make the film interesting and probably lasting.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID "},{"Title":"One of the best movies from a Grisham book","Date":"29 July 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" I have seen many movies that were made from a John Grisham book, it almost seems that every book he writes ends up becoming a movie.

I also loved how Coppola chose not to focus on just one aspect of Grisham's narrative, but rather included all of it. This main character doesn't just have one client, but several and although the film focuses on the big one mainly, we still get to see what happens in all cases.As someone who has had first-hand experience with juries and courtrooms, I can honestly say this was probably the best interpretation of all the situations and policies in which they use in real life. That makes this more fun to watch as you start thinking about your own time in these situations. As a film, the acting carries it very far, the writing is a solid foundation and the music is funky and gives it a different context. I can honestly say this is one of Coppola's most honorable achievements. He manages to capture the spirit of Grisham the author and Grisham the critic of the judicial system.

It is this quite needless implicit misogyny that spoils the movie for me.Matt Damon is excellent as the law graduate looking for a first break. The best that he can find is a dubious sleaze-ball on the threshold of criminality, played by Mickey Rourke. This man retains a gofer called Deck Shifflet, played with scene-stealing slyness by Danny DeVito. Damon's novice is introduced to the fine art of ambulance chasing and any other vulturesgue legal shenanigans that will turn a fast buck. They're not what he had in mind.In between a dotty old dowager's will and her grasping family, he picks up on a young man dying from some wasting disease and an insurance company that won't take up his medical expenses. Cue, a megabuck lawsuit The titular Rainmaker.The whole thing is directed and acted with commendable panache. And there's a script to do it ample justice.At the same time, Rudy encounters a battered young wife at a hospital, and the presumption of institutionalised male violence is both irritating and plain wrong. The facts prove that most domestic violence is instigated by females, not males. But males being bigger and stronger and inherently more violent, usually suffer the least physically. Whereas contrariwise; females invariably come off worst. And it shows.Clearly, domestic disputes are the small change of common law at the poorer end of any legal profession, and someone in Rudy's position would almost certainly encounter cases. What I find irritating is the unquestioning stereotypic presumption of male guilt. It's a point needlessly emphasised by the wife's childish and demure persona, against the husband's 'raging bull' excess. They are almost a cliché in themselves. The interpretation is, of course, politically correct. Feminists have been blighting the good name of males for decades. It is a lie that, having been told often enough and loudly enough, has become truth. It's just a shame that the genuine complexities of fractured relationships are over-simplified to appease this supposed common denominator. Doubters should study the findings of feminist, Erin Pizzey, who established the first refuge In England for battered women.In fact, the subtler bi-line here is that, having made an unsatisfactory choice, this young woman merely waited for some more eligible male to seduce. And what better than a sentimental, idealistic, up-and-coming young lawyer? He would be manipulated into defending her cause like a knight-errant, and compete for her charms with the unsatisfactory husband. Females have been playing males off against each other in just this way for millions of years. That's precisely why we ARE bigger and stronger than the opposite sex. Males have been genetically engineered to prove their breeding potential by fighting each other. Read Darwin's 'Descent Of Man'; it's all in there. Her motive behind the tantalizing cinema liaison couldn't have been more obvious. And Rudy was like putty in her hands, obsessing over her all the way home. Ultimately our young hero is drawn towards a fatal confrontation. It is one in which he himself is beguiled into criminal activity. After Rudy beats the husband senseless, this wife persuades him to leave. His voice-over states 'she knew exactly what to do'. And we hear her off-camera administering the final coup-de-grace to her now-disabled husband by means of his own baseball bat. A potential case of murder. Rudy's voice-over goes on 'even then she was only thinking of me'. Yes; but not in the way he supposed. It would hardly have served her purpose to have her new champion and his prospects compromised by criminal charges. He was, after all, the next meal-ticket - something later emphasised when the enormous potential of the insurance lawsuit becomes clear. 'How much of that will you get?' she asks. Unwittingly, Rudy responds; 'Well, you get right down to it, don't you?' It's a joke. But actually, it isn't (not to her).So he fled the scene of a killing in which he conspired, that might at least be construed as manslaughter, withheld material evidence and testimony from the the police, and later manifest a blatant conflict of interests by legally representing the young widow. Not exactly the moral high-ground to which he once aspired. Even Mickey Rourke's 'Bruiser' character didn't participate in a killing.As I say, this is a well cast movie that is for the most part warm and tenderly played. But this gross-on piece of anti-male propaganda sticks like a frog in the throat. I'd give it 9 stars otherwise.

Many in the film industry do not like his books and especially don't like the clichéd way the stories develop. Fans of his books, however, want the exact same excellence, in the film.So it goes with The Rainmaker. If you didn't like the book, odds are you enjoyed the movie, if you never read the book, odds are you found it a refreshing underrated film, if you were a huge fan of the book, seeing a condensed version of it, put you off severely.As a rule, I avoid reading a book before seeing a movie based on it. They are two separate things. If one can separate the book from a movie that went over the usual 120 minute formula as it was, you can see this film for what it is, refreshing, unique, and hardly as clichéd as any other lawyer story or movie.What makes this one tick so well? Fleshed out characters other than the lead, different levels of supporting characters, some that help hold up the story, some that help hold up the main character, and some that could be considered incidental. Then there is the lack of court clichés. There is no rambling speech, not by the main character, the evil opponent, or the judge. No speech. Perhaps because the seamless narration of the story provides a nice subtle speech throughout the film. Everytime the story seems on the edge of the predictable court drama twist, it surprises.Our hero, Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon), has absolutely no idea what he is doing. He chose the law because he idolized the civil rights lawyers who stood up for what was right. A shame that isn't the law he is pursuing. Instead, he is the part of the law lampooned the most, ambulance chasers, suing someone for a bloody nose, a broken arm, hot coffee spilled on one's legs ... you get the drift. Rudy loves the law. It is apparent from the beginning of the film, the law does not love Rudy. His main case, a leukemia patient who did not get a bone marrow transplant because his insurance company, Great Benefits, had the gall to deny his claim eight times, call the patient's mother stupid, stupid, stupid, and call the treatment, an experimental procedure in open court. As a result, the patient eventually dies and Rudy, the lone lawyer in his firm, takes on Leo F. Drummond (Jon Voight) and his band of merry stuffed shirts for the insurance company. Rudy is outgunned and he knows it. His partner in his firm, Deck Schifflet (Danny DeVito), knowledgeable about the law, but has failed the bar five times and has just as much court experience as Rudy ... zero. Rudy also gets distracted with an abused young wife named Kelly Riker (Claire Danes). His attraction to the girl and how her abused past mirrors that of his mother and himself, reveals little insights into Rudy that we will not see in the courtroom.It is the realness of Rudy and Deck, their imperfections, the fact that they are obviously fallible, that makes the movie so refreshing. Drummond too is an enigma; He is merely the lawyer, not a member of the company. There is no specific reason to hate him, he is good at what he does, he overpowers Rudy mainly based on the law and experience, not on money and power. It is never even clear where Drummond's false sincerity begins and ends in his dealing with Rudy. By making Drummond the opponent, it gives the viewers a rare treat. Drummond is doing his job, he is doing it well, and is a rarity in court films, a worthy opponent, who could realistically, crush our hero like a bug. Kelly also has more than one dimension. Being abused does not make her whiny, co-dependant, and unable to think on her own two feet, and make crucial decisions. She is a rarity as the damsel in distress, when it really counts, she is as strong as her hero.Then it goes without saying the acting is also done in a subtle and successful manner. DeVito especially is superb with his delicate balance of humor as the ambulance chasing Deck. In the middle of an important deposition, Coppola's script relieves the tension by showing us Deck preying on a boy with a broken arm for his business. DeVito may be best known for his over the top character in Taxi, an obvious little troll with few redeeming qualities. Contrast Deck, also a troll with few redeeming qualities, but with great subtleness, it is those qualities that shine through and Deck is anything but over the top. It shows DeVito's amazing skill and control and should have earned him an Oscar nomination. Voight, plays once again, the villain, but unlike his pandering and embarrassing role in Anaconda, with a hear through accent, and little effort, as Drummond, he becomes the role. You forget the actor is not really a southern little worm. Danes, also does a strong job. But it is the actors in the smaller, more thankless roles, like Mary Kay Place, as the victim's mother, Mickey Rourke, as Deck and Rudy's former sleazy employer, and especially an uncredited Danny Glover, as the judge, who bring color and extra depth to characters that could have easily been cookie cutter clichés when Coppola found the need to par down the book's plot.Coppola took a rare, unique, and stylish gem by Grisham, one so different from his other books it was either deemed an overwhelming success or failure, in comparison to his other work, and did a good job trimming the fat, without trimming the dimensions of the book's most crucial characters. He takes out what won't work with his vision, without taking out who the characters are.Something about this movie just works in all the necessary places. While it is not a movie of the year, it is a solid film. All films have perceived imperfections by the viewers and critics, and this one is no exception. It, however, does not have major missteps in any important part of the film. The acting is practically flawless, the direction is practically flawless, and the writing, is amazingly, for a court film, incredibly absent of major flaws.It is certainly worth the less than four dollars it would take to judge for yourself.

I have also over the years grown a liking to great actors of today such as Matt Damon, Jon Voight and Danny DeVito. To tell you the truth, I rented this movie by accident. I knew nothing about it and had another movie in my hand when up on the screen at Blockbuster video, I saw a clip of this movie. I said to myself I've gotta rent that sometime. Looks good. I knew nothing about it, but I saw that Jon Voight and Matt Damon were in it and it was about law. So, I turned around and saw the movie there. I put down the movie I had and picked this up. Boy, was I glad I picked this one up.First of all, John Grisham is an amazing writer. The characters are absolutely believable and have truly interesting characteristics and idiosyncracies. The cast, while only four to five of the names may be household names and could be recognized off the street, is assembled exceptionally well. Jon Voight acts his heart out in this antagonistic role. Matt Damon, an uprising young actor whom I have grown great respect for, is charming and quite intelligible. I especially enjoyed the uncredited role of Judge Kipler played by Danny Glover as well as Danny De Vito.The story takes place in Tennessee with Rudy Baylor, played by Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting, Saving Private Ryan) is a young lawyer who has just recently passed the bar exam and joins the law firm of a corrupted and very odd lawyer known as Bruiser Stone, played by Mickey Rourke. There he meets Deck Schifflet, played by Danny DeVito (L.A. Confidential, Batman Returns) who has failed the bar exam 5 times, though he still practices law. He follows the certain rule in law of ambulance chasing. Throughout the film, we see him nonchalantly and hilariously warming up to injured people and subtly begging to be their lawyer.After Bruiser gives Schifflet and Baylor a $5500 bonus, they decide to break off from the firm and start their own. Baylor, currently has two cases. One is an old woman named Miss Birdie who wants her children out out out! of her will and for everything to go to a television personality. She hires Rudy to take care of the legal part. Rudy soon moves in to the small house next to Miss Birdie. His second case is a boy, Donny Ray Black who has leukemia and his insurance company Great Benefit has denied his family's claim 8 times, and tells the boy's mother that she is stupid stupid stupid.Rudy goes through hell trying to get this case off the ground, after being denied by Judge Harvey Hale who dies, after finding out that two key witnesses are missing and that his staff is one man who has yet to pass the bar exam and Great Benefit has Leo F. Drummond, played by Jon Voight (Mission Impossible, Midnight Cowboy) and several laid back rich hot heads.Also, Rudy Baylor has a love interest. He has met Kelly Riker, played by Claire Danes (Brokedown Palace, Romeo + Juliet) who has an abusive husband and is often found bloodied and bruised at the hospital. He guides Kelly and is her guardian angel and lends an ear for her troubles.While this film is absolutely incomparable to The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola's direction is on the same level. Why this was so overlooked by the academy, I do not know. Jon Voight outshines all in this wonderful story. You love him and hate him. As I previoulsy stated, the cast is excellent. The chemistry between everyone is truly realistic. Honorable mention to Mary Kay Place, Dean Stockwell, Theresa Wright, Johnny Whitworth, Mickey Rourke and Red West.I would reccommend this movie to just about anyone. Just one minor...not a flaw, but something I didn't like is that it really bashes the legal system very much and gives a negative display of how lawyers work, especially during the ending monologue. But outside of that, this is a nearly flawless film. ****1/2 out of *****.

His ambivalence with his own skill at the more ethically borderline aspects of the law comes through strongly -- while his character is clearly satisfied that his actions are justified, he's not happy he's had to go as far as he does. Damon communicates this ambivalence with a seemingly effortless skill that lets the character speak instead of the movie star.

I am also compelled to watch the adaptations, because they are usually equally as compulsive. The Rainmaker is no different, but in this it is more than just another thriller about a young lawyer fulfilling his materialistic dreams. In fact it's quite the opposite, here young Rudy Baylor is defending someone completely conquered by a corporation's quest for dollars. it is a wonderful ethical tale about corporate greed and its effects on people it has ridden roughshod over. It's chilling when you consider that modern society is mostly dominated now by corporations ,and that their reason for existence is ultimately for money. Of course we all know this, but this film highlights it in a brilliant way, and shows an excellent example of the injustice. So this tale of an evil insurance corporation preying on underprivileged folk trying to sell them 'streetsurance' becomes quite moving. Rudy Baylor takes up the case against 'Great Benefit' who will not pay up on a life insurance claim that would be the only form of survival for a teenager dying with leukemia. Matt Damon portrays accurately the young, rookie lawyer who still has ideals and is not too cynical yet as to not feel uncomfortable about being presented with blatant ambulance-chasing. Danny De Vito is perfect as the bar-exam flunking, wisecracking paralegal with questionable ethics. In addition to a moving storyline and quintessential characters, the film is shot very atmospherically with locations that are more than just background and comment as much on the situation as the dialogue. Also there are some excellent pieces of lawyer intrique and humour that of course can be attributed directly to Grisham. The soundtrack was also something worth commenting on, it was never invasive and had a great jazzy, murky feel which summed up the moviue and the legal profession in general. If you're looking for a good way to spend a Monday Night, then watch this intelligent legal thriller, the story being relatively simplistic and with an odd extra piece of storyline about a very clichéd battered girl. This is a very high quality popular film.

He's likeable from the opening shots. Why we need to have his likeability gratuitously hammered into us throughout the film escapes me.He's a working class kid bartending his way through law school.  He's level-headed and idealistic, with just the right touch of savvy cynicism. He defends battered women (in a plotline that has no purpose other than to make us like Rudy even more).  He feels distaste at ambulance chasing.  He stands up for the poor and simple victims of corporate tyranny and exploitation.  He even does yardwork for his elderly landlady.How much more compelling to see him change and grow in the film, say, from a poor young lawyer with dollar signs in his eyes who tries to cash in on a lucrative insurance settlement only to realize that his clients are, well, his people.  We'd still like ol' Rudy, but we'd have a decent reason to.Claire Danes?  Fine work, but a superfluous storyline.  John Voight? Commendable, but just shy of the quality of Robert Duvall in A Civil Action. Danny Devito?  Either annoying or adorable, depending on taste.  Mary Kay Place?  Riveting as the mother of the young leukemia victim given the brush-off by an insurance giant.  Mickey Rourke?  Interestingly costumed and coiffed, but ultimately pointless.Thankfully we are spared the standard Grisham story of the young attorney of southern extraction who, in his hubris, commits the fatal and tragic flaw which sets the car chases in motion.  (Though we do get a delightful bugged-office twist, with a cameo, I believe, from Randy Travis.)It needed work, both in plotting and casting (kill the Danes storyline and replace it with more character insight and growth for Rudy; re- or decast several principals), but in all a satisfying and moderately thoughtful big budget film.

I did sneak a peek at a friend's copy of The Rainmaker, read about twenty pages filled with cliched characters, and I still can't figure out why his books sell millions. The movie version of The Firm was lacklustre, and I nearly nodded off during The Pelican Brief. On the flipside, I enjoyed A Time to Kill. So, it was with some apprehension that I tuned into The Rainmaker on cable. The fact that Francis Coppola directed it eased my worries a bit. Apocalypse Now was amazing, and the Godfather movies are classics. Coppola has a way of bringing out the best in even the most simplistic material. Matt Damon was the ideal choice to play the young, this-is-my-first-case-and-boy-am-I-scared lawyer who takes on a big insurance company. Mickey Rourke disappears too quickly as Damon's would-be mentor, but thankfully we have Danny DeVito around as a resourceful paralegal who shows Damon the ropes. There's an awkward subplot involving a battered wife (Claire Danes, unfortunately always sporting a fat lip or a black eye). Naturally, Damon feels sorry for her, and falls in love. Perhaps Grisham should have written a second book! No, let's not give him any ideas. The investigations leading to the big trial are well done, and Coppola does a great job setting up the courtroom battle. We can't help rooting for Damon as he fights to prove the insurance company's failure to pay a claim  resulted in the death of a young man. It's not exactly The Verdict. That movie was far more complex (and featured a superb performance from Paul Newman). Still, The Rainmaker delivers. And, I'm actually looking forward to seeing The Chamber.

I mean you can't think you wasted your time when you leave the theater. Concerning other aspects, I must say that I can't avoid to think of the similarity between the couple Damon-De Vito and the characters Don Quijote and Sancho Panza from the famous novel by Cervantes. As in the novel, Damon is a knight that fights for a lost cause, and De Vito is a practical man who always tries to take benefit from every situation. As the film progresses (and as in the novel) Damon transmits his spirit to De Vito and finally he fights for the cause with even more conviction than Damon (and he is even fat and short like the novel character...!) One negative point It's comforting to see the truth and justice prevail over everything, but I can't accept Damon as the final hero when he killed another man and nothing happened to him.

Armed only with his ingenuity and his partner's resourcefulness, Rudy takes everyone who underestimates his ability by surprise.  Of course having a sympathetic judge does help.

It was released in theaters here but for a short time. I've never heard of this film being on regular TV and not even in cable TV, and the closer I get of this film was seeing the DVD somewhere, and unfortunately I haven't bought it. And to found it on the internet was even the hardest task ever but it's certainly rewarding.I'm not much into conspiracy theories but I really think someone's hiding this film from viewers. Who could it be? Maybe Paramount itself, company that distributes this film isn't much interested in making it more available for exhibitions or selling. But the danger of The Rainmaker lies in a story about bringing risky and millionaire lawsuits against health insurance companies, and (here comes the conspiracy theory which I was referring), but maybe the real companies are paying Paramount to hide this film in the best possible way. The film remains criminally underrated despite having some favorable things about it.In The Rainmaker, Matt Damon plays Rudy Baylor, an promising and idealistic young lawyer, graduated from Harvard, trying his way into the law business working in a revolting case against Great Benefit, an health insurance company that denied an bone marrow transplant of Donny Ray, a young man dying of leukemia, something that was covered in their policy. Baylor's test is not only in this trial, fighting against Leo F. Drummond (an impeccable and inspiring Jon Voight) and his team of lawyers defending Great Benefit but also in dealing with his boss (Mickey Rourke), involved in some illicit business; with his partner Deck (Danny DeVito) who'll be of great help in bringing testimonies for his case and showing how justice and law really works outside of what law schools teach; and a semi-romantic affair he has with Kelly (Claire Danes), victim of an abusive husband he mets. And believe me, the film never slows down its rhythm at any of these segments, they're all interesting.It's a story about a man fighting for what he believes in a troubled, dangerous, greedy and unethical world but he also needs to make some tricks in order to survive in this same world. His first client before Donny Ray's family is a guy involved in car accidents and who don't have a lawyer to represent them in legal assistance (but it's not something Rudy gets proud of). Rudy is also counts with luck to get things done, I mean, who could have thought that the original Judge selected for this case (and not much friendly with Rudy and his case) would collapse and die, being substituted by a more correct and friendly Judge (Danny Glover)? Like I said, all the segments were interestingly well made but the one that really captures all of our attention (and this is a must when it comes in films like these) is the whole trial. Here's an exciting, electrifying trial and obviously there's surprises (the appearance of a key witness, played by Virginia Madsen), twists and turns, some funny moments and the most interesting aspect of all, it shows how the legal system works, it digs deep into tiny little things that can make a huge difference between winning and losing a court battle.Despite this being directed by Francis Ford Coppola, in one of his attempts to pay for all the costs of the troubled and overbugeted One From the Heart, which might sound like an film made for giving return in box-office less than being an intelligent and artistic film, The Rainmaker contains countless characteristics of his skillful direction, it's filmed and edited in a great style (one of those things that when you look back and watch the films made in the 1990's and then look at the ones made now, you feel the nostalgic feeling that, somehow, the films back then were better and this is a great example of that), followed by a nice soundtrack, and of course, the gigantic group of talented actors present here which also includes small appearances of Roy Scheider, Theresa Wright and Dean Stockwell, all in very good roles. Based on a John Grisham novel (he considers this his favorite film of all film adaptations of his work), this courtroom thriller is brilliantly memorable and it has one of the most original and realistic endings ever presented in films like these, it might look like an obvious cliché but then you have to wait to see more of what's about to come.

Desperate he receives employment from a notarize lawyer nicknamed Bruiser played by Mickey Rourke. Rudy meets Deck Shifflet played by Danny Devito, a lawyer who has failed the bar exam six times and is forced to fly under the radar in order to practice law. A claim denial from a major insurance company, which at first seems simple enough, is dumped on Rudy and Deck. A mother who has a son dying of Leukemia desperately needs money from the insurance company to pay for a crucial bone marrow transplant. As Rudy and Deck further investigate the case, they come to realize that they are in way over their heads. During the preliminary trial, the insurance company sends its big guns, a battalion of over paid top notch lawyers headed by Leo F. Drummond played by the infamous Jon Voight, who played an equally villainous role in The Manchurian Candidate. Rudy and Deck struggle to unearth the secrets lurking in the shadows of the insurance company, each time they think that they have found a lead, the insurance team of lawyers seem to have a rebuttal, leaving the two grasping at straws. The acting in this movie is superb to say the least. Matt Daemon cleverly gives his character the look and feel of an average man, trying to find his way through life. Danny Devito plays an excellent supporting role, playing as a mentor to Rudy and providing crucial transitions through out the story. Jon Voight makes a fantastic villain, by duplicating a stereo typical lawyer. When it came to camera work, the director (Francis Ford Coppola) made an excellent choice in keeping it all very simple. There are no fancy transitions or filters to distract viewers from the experience. The cameras always focus more on the actors themselves rather than what is around them. Both lighting and the set scheme are kept simple. The sets consist mostly of court rooms and small office spaces, sets designed not to detract from the action. Lighting seemed almost absent from the movie, the light seemed give itself more of a natural feeling to the movie, rather then being artificial. The music gives a real sense of time and place for the viewers of the movie. The music is very slow and easy going, there is no heart pounding action music. The music is mainly used to make nice transitions. Overall this movie is well made and worth viewing. The movie has an all-star cast that interacts well off each other's acting. Set schemes are simple and with good reason. The Rainmaker is more of a courtroom drama rather then a movie. Viewers who enjoy television shows like Law and Order will like this movie. Viewers looking for heart pounding movie with lots of explosions, will not find this movie interesting.

Rudy first goes to work for a well known firm headed by a compromising ambulance chaser(Mickey Rourke)and then bolts with a 'paralawyer' and new partner(Danny DeVito)and takes on a monumental case representing a poor client against a large Cleveland insurance company that has denied the same legitimate claim eight times. Rudy goes up against a ruthless adversary Leo F. Drummond(Jon Voight). In spite of its two hour plus running time THE RAINMAKER is ambitious, powerful and a genuine 'pot boiler'. The supporting cast is made up of more than apt players like Danny Glover, Claire Danes, Virginia Madsen, Mary Kay Place and Red West. Damon is fresh and full of vigor.

It is quite faithful to the sequence of events considering that a great deal has to be fit into a couple of hours. Necessarily, there is plot/character compression, but it doesn't detract significantly from the story. The real problem is the portrayal of the court case between the Blacks and Great Benefit. In the book there is no doubt that the executives of Great Benefit are utterly wrong, nor is there any doubt that they are going to be soundly thrashed. What makes it a great read is the righteous pleasure we get as the execs at Great Benefit are caught lying over and over again, and are forced to face their wrong-doing. Unfortunately, the movie makers do not trust the material here, opting instead to create a fake crisis. They make it appear that Rudy and the Blacks might actually lose the case by first destroying the testimony of Jackie Lemanczyk, and then saying that Donny Ray's leukemia was a type that would not be cured by a bone marrow transplant. This is completely contrary to the book and greatly damages the integrity of the story. It is stupid and unnecessary. Also, there is a real problem with the fight scene between Rudy and Cliff. In the book Rudy mortally wounds Cliff in self-defense and Kelly tells Rudy to leave to avoid the police. In the movie though, after Rudy leaves we clearly hear (off camera) Kelly hitting Cliff again with the baseball bat. The implication is that Cliff wasn't dead yet and Kelly was finishing him off. Why did they think that having Kelly make a calm, conscious choice to kill Cliff was a good idea? This is really wrong. This movie had the potential to be great, but instead is mediocre simply because the writers did not trust the material. Too bad! And by the way, why did they play such inappropriate music during the first half of the film, as if it was supposed to be a screwball comedy? Awful!

Can inexperienced Rudy take on the fat cat corporate sharks and dish out some justice ?This is a polished, well made, well acted courtroom drama from a bestselling novel by John Grisham, whose legal thrillers were very popular in the nineties (The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Client). I'm afraid however I don't think much of the plot - greedy insurance company versus terminally ill kid coughing up blood is a bit too hackneyed for me, and when it throws in fisticuffs with the jury, company documents with mysterious missing bits, and last minute witnesses having affairs with the defendants, my Credibility Proximity Warning lights start to flash. It also has a lengthy subplot involving a battered wife which is touching but has precisely zero relevance. In my view, stories should be tight, focused and original, and I'm not convinced Grisham's are. That said the characters are rich and the drama has some good points to make about the legal exploitation of the US working class, as well as many funny scenes, like the one where DeVito walks down to the hospital and presses his card into the hands of patients in traction. Its strongest suit is the cast - Damon is suitably bewildered and well-intentioned, DeVito holds everything together as the shyster evidence man, Voight is toothy and evil as the corporate pit bull, an unbilled Glover is the judge, Madsen (Dune, Candyman) has an eye-catching part as a bitter and sullied ex-executive, the late great Scheider shows up at the end as the CEO, and Coppola alumni Rourke and Stockwell shine in off-the-wall parts as a mumbling one-step-away-from-prison legal embezzler and a bad-tempered emphysemic judge with a very short life expectancy respectively. The batty old bird is played by Teresa Wright, the young star of several forties classics (such as Hitchcock's Shadow Of A Doubt), aged seventy-seven and making her final film, and West in the small part of the Dad shows how it's possible to create a thought-provoking and fully-fledged character with literally no dialogue. They're all fun to watch strutting their stuff and riffing off each other. In the end though, this is a disappointing movie for me, purely because its scope falls well short of its director's talent. It's a good movie, but it's a safe movie - it looks familiar, it makes you smile and gasp at all the right points, and the heroes win. What makes Coppola's movies great is when he doesn't make them safe. Most people would say this is a better film than One From The Heart, but not me - while that movie may have its flaws too, it's completely original and unlike anything else; it's an artist putting himself on the line (and in that instance getting savaged for it) but injecting his soul into his art. The Rainmaker is a solid bet, an agreeable thriller, but unlike its director it's nothing special.

Where the film goes wrong is that it concentrates solely on Rudy Bailor's story. I can't think of a single scene in which he doesn't feature. His opponents are only ever seen in the courtroom. To me, this single thread wears a bit thin when expanded to fill a two-hour film. Several concurrent threads would have helped to maintain the pace. Mickey Rourke, as Rudy Bailor's mafia lawyer boss Bruiser Stone is sadly under-used. The same goes for Jon Voight as Rudy's legal opponent Leo F.

Newman plays Frank Galvin, burnt-out alcoholic lawyer. Danny Devito plays the Jack Warden role. One case focuses upon a boy stricken with leukemia in which the insurance company will not cover a bone marrow transplant. The other film's focus is upon a woman who enters a hospital to give birth and is given the wrong anesthetic. The surprise witnesses are similar too.

But little of his recent output can compare, and certainly not 'The Rainmaker', a by-the-book adaptation of a typical John Grisham courtroom thriller.  Grisham's greatest strength is that he actually makes the legal process seem interesting, but three-dimensionality is not necessarily his strong point, and the ending is disappointingly straightforward.  Rudi Baylor, the hero is this case, is a young, inexperienced, under-resourced, poor, idealistic lawyer fighting a just case against an evil corporation (and, just if we weren't convinced, saving an impossibly beautiful battered wife from her brutal husband at the same time).  It's a shame it's all so obvious, as there are some interesting ethical points here.  Baylor wants to fight for justice and lawyers who defend the wealthy and wicked come in for major criticism,and it's a real point that the richest can, up to a point, afford to buy the law. But the basis of an adversarial legal system is that both sides have the right to representation, and viewed from one perspective it's not a lawyer's job to pre-judge the case.  Also, with no-win, no-fee, a lawyer can get personally rich fighting the good fight, while other lawyers earn little giving the most despicable members of society the right to a fair hearing in court. The question of what makes a good lawyer, in moral terms, is hard to answer, but this film does not want to address these issues even when Baylor calls on the skills of his criminal ex-boss, this is presented as a justified action, so clear is the merit of his case.  Sidney Lumet's 'The Verdict' is a far more ambiguous, and hence stronger, treatment of similar material; and besides, Paul Newman can act Matt Damon into the ground.  The verdict on 'The Rainmaker' watchable but unremarkable.

Well,  wrong this movie went.  Within the first 5 minutes it starts to veer left and just heads right on South. Funny thing is, if you plucked out each element and looked at it on its own you couldn't complain.  Maybe the score should get some complaints.  Sure didn't help any and probably hurt.But it's just flatter than a pancake.  There's only a couple of small bumps that almost give it some character; Danny Glover and the psychotic husband. Well, slams aside, there's a lot of good performances from the actors, D.P., art direction, sound people, etc.  Guess we'll have to blame the Chef Francis for this disaster.

With good characterizations and a good tempo in its storytelling, it is amazing that this movie is bad. The music is aggravating, quickly and constantly changing from a comedic, quirky score to a dramatic, depressing one. And the case Black versus Great Benefits seemed totally off key as to what would truly happen if such a case were to arrive.It is Tennessee. Rudy Baylor passes law school to be thrust into not only an ambulance chasing life, but a big case against an insurance company that refuses to help a young man's life.The casting is what saves THE RAINMAKER from being a joke. The 'green' look of Matt Damon and the opportunistic appeal of Danny Devito save much of this garbage from being forgettable. THE RAINMAKER remains true to the novel in some ways, but the story is just too unbelievable at times save for some smart moments. Just another law movie to be thrown around.

Perhaps the only redeeming aspect is the talents of Danny DeVito, cast as Rudy's ever-scheming partner, Deck. The most frustrating aspect of the film is that the characters are all cast properly, but the actors did not reach their full potential due to sloppy editing and an incredibly slow-paced plot. Granted, this is a courtroom drama, not an action movie, but the plot is so fragmented that it's hard to stay focused on the Great Benefits Insurance case. Although true to the book, the Miss Birdie and forbidden love subplots bog down the film with slow, uneventful scenes that do little to challenge Rudy's beliefs and substantially strengthen him as a character. If you've read the book, then you may enjoy this adaption for what it's worth--namely, DeVito's acting and a few lawyer jokes to pocket for later.http//bitesizemoviereview.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"A sad interpretation of the book","Date":"4 March 2005","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":" I am so tired of the movies made from books that eliminate important facts and change items to appease the viewer. First things first, the monologue begins the movie detailing some of what they found unworthy to shoot on film. Missing in this is how Rudy lost his job to the boys at Tinley Britt, but I guess that little bit of conflict was unnecessary huh? We start the movie when Rudy gets his job with Bruiser and that is about half way through the book. Left out again is Rudy's best friend, Booker, and the stress he is feeling over his lost love and his eviction and bankruptcy. The bankruptcy is mentioned in passing but that is it.This is forgivable until we get to the trial. What is left out Involvement from his professors, the section U discovery with his new found lawyer friends, and a large part of conflict between Kipler and Drummond. Danny Glover is OK, but a more energetic and younger actor would have fared better I think. If you read the book, nothing goes wrong for young Rudy and the judge is so partial it is scary, but we missed major points of the movie without that conflict building and the total embarrassment of the big shot lawyer by the judge and new attorney.Danny Devito was AWESOME as Deck, and he had the ticks and mannerisms down pat. Damon was decent but not real dynamic.If you have not read the book, this is not a bad movie I suppose, but I can divorce myself from the inconsistencies enough to realize that the courtroom drama was not all that compelling either. Considering how good the first three book to movie conversions went, this was a chance at redemption after the Chamber. Not a very good movie, and more support for reading a novel over seeing things interpreted on film.

It uses different techniques to bring upon compelling material in an audience. These techniques are fresh and entertaining, but do not necessarily allow this film to have the chance to be a standout movie in its gender. So there you have it, an avowed overview of the content of this review a film that stands as good, but is still nothing to get exited about.The picture stars Matt Damon as Rudy Baylor, a novice lawyer who has just recently finished  law school. His character narrates the film, and at times, explains a little too much of the story to us. He has chosen to become a lawyer not because of his father, who used to beat him and his mother up, but because it has been his lifelong dream to become one. In fact, he is so desperate for work, Rudy excepts a job from a corporate fraud in which the only other standing attorney in his firm is a short and suspicious man named Deck Schifflet. The two of them soon become partners forming their own independent law firm with next to zero cash in hand. The next step in forming an attorney? Finding a client. And that is exactly what Rudy and Deck intend to do. The two of them stumble opon an insurance company scandal featuring a young man dying of a curable disease, with his parent's near bankruptcy restricting him from receiving treatment. Rudy claim's the insurance company refused to pay them medical insurance. The company claims it was all a misunderstanding. The fat cat lawyer in charge of the defense is Leo F. Drummond, who is played perfectly by Jon Voight, who has about a dozen other powerful attorney's representing his client as well. During a particularly effective scene where the two opposing sides meet to discuss matters at banquette room, we see the prosecution in the hands of inexperienced Rudy alone, representing an underdog in over his head. While the defense side represents ignorance and experienced power by expressing many experienced and mighty lawyers. This scene serves as a golden moment in the film.The film offers a good, constant point of view through Damon's position. Before the movie is over, he'll induce a love story that belongs in a different film. In it he helps eliminate the troubles of a young woman. Even as this romantic subplot distracts our attention away from our main focus, the big trial case of insurance fraud, the movie manages, through a distinct view point, to overcome this problem and turn it into something engaging. Matt Damon is a little shaky in his leading role here. But then again, under the circumstances, his character should be a little on the nervous side.The success of The Rainmaker' is backed up with a cast of confidence. As I've already said, Damon is somewhat iffy in his role, but Danny DeVito, his accomplice, offers hilarity and relief. Young actress Claire Danes is at home here as well, appropriately portraying her character with confusion and hardship. Veteran actor Jon Voight offers just the right amount of overpowering material to allow his character to challenge the audience. And even the minor role from Danny Glover, as the main judge, has some fun with his character. Overall, The Rainmaker covers fresh ground in its gender of trial dramas. It has a lot of fun with its plot, and is held together with consistency and a firm structure. The story is at first a bit unconvincing, but before the end of the production, it is as involving as A Civil Action (1998), or even Night Falls on Manhattan, (1997). Although clearly not as good as that film, or many others, it is still a prevailing attempt at an overly familiar subject.Brought to you by Paramount Pictures and Constellation Films.

Otherwise, I never would've been able to comprehend what was happening in this movie.  What went wrong?!  Characters and sub-plots are introduced then discarded repeatedly throughout the entire movie. For example, it is never fully revealed why Bruiser left his practice or what happened to Birdy's will.  Why introduce them if we aren't given all the information about them?  The entire film had a rushed pace to it. In short, I think this movie fell very short of its potential.  I expected a much greater film from Francis Ford Coppala.

This film, at best, is loosely based on John Grisham's novel and does the book no justice. While Matt Damon (Rudy Baylor), Danny DeVito (Deck Shifflet) and Jon Voight (Leo Drummond) are outstanding in their respective roles, it is more the substance of the film that is lacking. If you've read the book, you'll know what I mean. The film starts halfway through the book with Rudy already working for Bruiser Stone (who is played quite effectively by Mickey Rourke, I might add), and gives no background as to why he's there or the circumstances that led up to his employment with Bruiser. The viewer is then led through the trial process quickly and with virtually no tie-ins to the deep emotional impact of the case on Dot Black and Donny Ray. The viewer is given no insight into the relationships between Rudy and Kelly Riker, Rudy and Dot Black, or even Rudy and Donny Ray. There are several events in the film that are completely contradictory to the events and even the sequence of the book. I could go on for an hour, but you get the picture. In short, if you've read the book and loved it as I did, you'll probably hate the film. If you haven't read the book or read it and hated it, it's possible you may enjoy the film. I myself found it deeply dissatisfying.

A young idealistic lawyer played by an up and coming well buffed pretty boy actor starts work at a law firm whose somewhat shady and cynical characters are played by well known actors. The first half of the movie is taken up by subplots that show the young idealistic lawyer to be a great humanitarian always on the side of the underdog with the second half of the movie having thriller elements coming more and more to the fore .Honestly you could cut and paste the above paragraph for every review of a John Grisham adapatation and no one would notice . Having said all that THE RAINMAKER is entertaining even though you can easily spot the flaws like how on earth could Matt Damon`s hero pass his exams and go to the gym to get a body like that , and of course it`s just little overlong like all Grisham movies .

I find it infuriating that so many kind comments have been posted about this movie.From the start I viewed Mr. Baylor as sleazy as Bruiser.  The first hint we have of his unlawyerly behavior is that he admits he has been evicted. Well, one isn't evicted without cause, especially one with legal skills. In short, this means that Mr. Baylor was evicted with cause.  This is but the first of his legal transgressions which make him, in my opinion, wholly unfit for the practice of law.Defense counsel in this diatribe is equally disreputable.  He bugs Plaintiff Counsel's office, engages in discovery abuses, etc.Mr. Grisham had done a great disservice to the legal community.  The layperson will see this film and think this is the way lawyers operate. Well it isn't.  "}]
