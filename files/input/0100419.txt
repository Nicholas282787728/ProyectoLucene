What about kids torturing animals like flies or frogs?Sure - this comedy is far of and unrealistic,  but so are cuuuuuuute and sweet  family  movies.So - I quite like the movie, it's a black comedy which is a nice counterpoint to sweet &  cute comedies like Home Alone.7 / 10  "},{"Title":"This Is Funny","Date":"12 September 2004","Score":"22 out of 31 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family","Review":"  I'm not a fan of comedies but any movie that starts with a scene of school children writing to their penpals with the following dialogue  Dear Queen Elizabeth .

I would recommend the comedy being mostly removed and it being done as a drama.. maybe a bit of a psychological case study type movie. The premise of a kid who is different finding love and acceptance is a good movie formula(like Martian Child). Even some of the scenes could even work in the drama version.A few that spring to mind are Junior's first night when Ben has a heart to heart with his new son in the kitchen. The scene is actually nice and touching. Ben really comes off well and Junior seems like a decent kid in the scene. The other is when Ben is free of the wife and Junior and is happy till he finds the picture. Another scene I'd keep.Overall, the movie is okay. It is very mean spirited and one has to wonder as Junior sets up his nasty pranks how no one notices him doing the things. The kid is a major brat and could stand a spanking or two. Jon Ritter's character is the only really well done character in the film.The drama version wouldn't have to be that much different plot wise really. Here goes Drop the opening of him being tossed from home to home. Just give a little exposition in dialog later. Give a bit of neglect and maybe some abuse to add weight to it. Open with the boy (give a name other than Junior (to generic))getting into some trouble and being scolded. Nothing psychotic like the comedy version. Make him an outcast still and the other kids are mean. Kid figures if he isn't liked, he will pick a role model who isn't nice... like a criminal (drop the stupid bow tie though.) Cut to the kindhearted dad and the mom. She can still be a bit of a witch and want the child for the selfless reasons. But the dad wants to be a good father and make a difference in a child's life. Heck we could make him just a single father. Keep the aggressive grandfather role. He can be the same jerk and not care for Junior since he is adopted.Junior acts out to get attention and gets in a fight with another kid who teases him. Dad sits down the son and talks him through his troubles. Kid still does stuff that is wrong but nothing like the awful pranks like in the 1990 version. He does it for the real reason a kid like that would. He sees any kind of attention as a good thing.Over the course of movie the boy starts to try and model himself after his new dad as he finally feels more acceptance. But when he tries to do something nice for his dad he ends up doing something really bad (like wrecking the car into a house or something). Fearing he will no longer be loved, he runs away. Dad desperately looks for his son and comes to the boy's aid. Ends with dad and son forming a bond of love and the boy beginning to heal.Cut, print, Oscar...There same basic plot and a lot of elements, but a more realistic approach. Instead of a sadistic child who laughs with glee at things that could have caused someone's death, we get a realistic scared child craving attention.

Problem Child came along just before the more sophisticated Home Alone, and blew all competition out of the way. The film has great gags, brilliant acting from everyone, and a witty dark side which few directors can properly show. Unfortunately, most people see it as juvenile, and it has become one of the most hated movies ever. However, it will always be one of my all-time favourites, and even though i first saw it when i was 7 or so and can see why it is so despised, i still find it hilarious.Junior is an orphan. Abandoned by his parents, he did the rounds at various homes, never staying at one place for too long because he never fit in, or rather- he was as one character says- 'wicked'. Junior finds himself at a Convent school where he soon starts trouble. The Administrator, Peabody sees that the Nuns want to get rid of him, and when he hears that a husband and wife who can't have kids are looking for a child to adopt, he cons them into taking Junior with them. Everyone's happy. However, the family soon realise that Junior is no angel, and want to get rid of him, but Ben Healy his adopted father sees that he is just a lonely kid who keeps getting shoved around. When Junior's hero- a murderer gets out of prison he comes to visit, kidnapping Junior and Flo Healy, Ben comes to the rescue.The film has too many funny moments to mention- the opening montage with Junior growing up, the scenes with the nuns, the camping trip, the baseball game, and even small things like- 'Look a giraffe!'- 'Look a fist!' make this film a comedy which deserves so much more respect than it will ever get. The dark side, the violence are neatly balanced by the fact that Junior just wants to be loved, and the film can be seen as an effective satire on the whole adoption process as well as a comment on modern parenting. Riiter is perfect as the father, warden is brilliant as old fashioned Big Ben, Yasbek is good as the annoying Flo, and Oliver puts in a stunning performance, stealing every scene he is in. Unfortunately he seems to have disappeared from the spotlight when it so dearly needs him. For all round laughs they do not come much better, and every kid should see this. When you grow up though, don't hate it just because it seems childish and amateurish, love it as it should be loved. 10 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Strange comedy","Date":"6 May 2001","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family","Review":"  Problem Child is one of the goofiest movies ever made.

Upon arrival he burns his bedroom and hurls the cat at grandpa who tumbles down a flight of stairs. Other antics include urination on a campfire, and placing firecrackers on a girl's birthday cake.

He causes chaos at the orphanage, then he causes havoc in Ritter's life, and he isn't even sympathetic in the end when we're suppose to care.

He is adopted by a loving man and his wacky wife. The laughs keep coming as the boy pushes them to the limits.Problem Child is one of the most unfunny and horrible movies ever to play on my television set. It's copies should be taken out and burned on a large public bonfire. Basically the movie tells the story of a man (played by John Ritter) and his gold-digging wife who adopt a kid named Junior, who is without a doubt the worst child ever to appear in front a movie camera. The two think that maybe they can reform this demon of a child, but throughout the course of the movie, he does one absolutely horrible thing right after another. It's people like Michael Oliver who give a bad name to child actors, seriously, only about ten minutes into the movie, I felt like I wanted to take a wrench and beat the kid to death with it, or even better, burn him with a flamethrower, slowly and painfully. Okay, maybe that sounds a little bit harsh, but really, if you watch this movie, and see just how obnoxious and bratty this kid is, you'll see what I'm getting at.Michael Richards (in a pre-Seinfeld role) plays Martin Beck, a serial killer, that Junior idolizes. What the f---? Idolizing a murderer? But then again, this is Junior that we're talking about, so it does make a little sense. Jack Warden is wasted in his role as Big Ben Healy, the father of John Ritter's character, who absolutely hates Junior. I was on Big Ben's side, and if I would have been in the movie, I probably would have gotten rid of Junior the very minute that I saw him. But as for who is the lowlight of this film? You guessed it, Michael Oliver, who plays Junior. Junior is even worse than Damien Thorn, believe me, when you see Junior and all of the bad things that he does, you will probably be wishing that you could warp yourself inside the television so that you could kick that stupid little brat right in the face, as he is such an obnoxious and smart-mouthed kid.All in all, Problem Child is bound to come up when you start talking about what you think would be among the worst movies that you have ever seen. Oh, and if you're wondering just what kind of trouble Junior causes, I'll tell you. Basically, he destroys trailers with a bulldozer, he beats up kids with a baseball bat while the adults just stand around and do nothing, he sets a room in fire, and he does much more. And like I said, he idolizes a serial killer. The only reason I watched this whole movie was to see that horrid kid get his comeuppance. But did he get his comeuppance? A resounding NO! He got away with all of it! Probably because we are supposed to feel sorry for him, because he's just misunderstood. He is not misunderstood. I understood that kid perfectly. He was a vile, obnoxious, arrogant, rotten, and spoiled little brat that deserved to be given a good thrashing, and a hard one at that.BOMB/10 "}{"Title":"Ahhhh look a Smiley Pie....","Date":"28 March 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Family","Review":" Junior is hardly a model child.

It's up to Ben as he undertakes a rescue mission to get Junior back from Beck before he plans on hurting him.For a film that's directed by Dennis Dugan, made so soon after Home Alone, and under an hour and twenty minutes, its not too bad.It's full of clichés and troupes, and there's no prizes for guessing how the finale will conclude, but it does its job like a McDonalds would, fills you full of garbage and hits the spot for a while, until self realisation kicks in.Ritter carries the film, and really puts his all into the doting dad, sometimes too much. The same cannot be said for the child members of the cast.

You rarely see raunchy humor in a kid's movie these days&#x85;(Animal abuse, sex jokes, etc. etc. and a high speed chase with guns) but it fail to live up to the idea of being Family-friendly which kind of hurts the movie in viewer-ship and thus it kind of bomb in the box office.

I picked it up and sat down to once again subject myself to the madness that is Problem Child. And lo and behold I was actually very impressed by it this time around. Of course when I was younger I just laughed at it and that was it. But now I have evolved into a full-on movie geek I can now appreciate its qualities as a film. I'll start with the infamous bow-tie killer - the inimitable Michael Richards (aka Seinfeld's Kramer) I hadnt seen Seinfeld when I first saw this movie, so it was avery pleasant chuckle i had watching him enjoy the role of Kramer amped up a few notches into a serial killer with a penchant for bowties... John Ritter is fabulous as always, the guy can't NOT be enjoyable to watch...he's just one of those male actors that I substituted for a father figure in my life so I'll always like him...may he RIP. I absolutely love him in this role - as the only one who is sympathetic to Junior, and the only human being to treat him with any real respect and kindness. He shines in this role and is a pleasure to watch. Amy Yasbeck does a good job as his money-grubbing-wife (just take the scene where Ritter's character convinces her to adopt...how she throws the cat away like a magazine she's done reading...very funny stuff). But the real light should shine on little Michael Oliver. I don't know if he went on to do anything else, but he's great in this. Look closely - it's an amazing little performance he gives as the rambunctious Junior. He's not a terrible kid - in fact, i found this time through i was much more sympathetic to his character. He's acting like any kid with half a brain would if confronted with these circumstances. Take the baseball game these guys are there chanting at him son of dork, son of DORK! and the coach was laughin along with em...I mean...who wouldn't take to them with a baseball bat?? And I absolutely loved the bit where he has just put the bow tie on and looks down out the window at the kid being adopted, leaving the orphanage. His gaze has I am going to be serial killer when I grow up written all over it! But I actually felt sorry for Junior a couple of times during the movie...especially when he's hiding in the church confession box and hears Mr Healy (Ritter) say he is going to return him to orphanage...my heartstrings were definitely pulled at watching Junior's reaction to this news. And that, to me, means its a good performance. Another classic is the progression of self help books we see Mr Healy reading. At first it's How to be great dad, then How to discipline your child and then finally, The Exorcist...classic!

There are so many classic, hilarious scenes that have been ripped off by other films. Michael Oliver was great in the first two Problem Child flicks, I wonder what ever became of him. He is truly the center of this film. He's not a cute kid -- He's ugly. He's foul mouthed and he's a brat (did I mention he hates clowns?). You can't help but watch this movie with a grin on your face. Some movies can't be held up to such high-standards. You cannot compare a Big-Mac to Filet-Mignon. They are both tasty, but they are of two different worlds. Just enjoy Problem Child for what it is a good way to kill a Sunday afternoon.P.S.

Big Benplans on running for mayor of Cold River;        The Healys decide to adopt and are conned, by Mr. Peabody, to adopt Junior. The nuns are all relieved to see him go. On Junior's first day, the Healy's cat Fuzzball suffers a trauma and Big Ben is rushed to the hospital. Gee, I wonder how that could've happened.Junior's bedroom is a clown themed one. Junior hates clowns.       In prison, a notorious serial killer, Marin Beck, a.k.a Bowtie Killer, escapes! He's Junior's idol. Junior wears a bowtie as an homage to him. Next day, Ben and Junior go camping with another family. The night is quite eventful, which included a bear terrorizing every- one. Junior is also invited (forced into being invited) to little Lucy's birthday party. She's a brat. Even more so than Junior. Everyone at the party treats Junior nasty, so he get's back at them, by sabotagingthe party exploding birthday candles, frogs in the punch bowl, presents in the pool, and a pinåta filled with all sorts of stuff you'd rather have not splash onto you once you bust it.

This movie is not attempting to infiltrate anarchic ideals into the minds of young children nor is it aiming to achieve great cinematic status.  Much like a fairy tale or a cartoon, the characters are meant to be caricatured, people! In a world where people are either inherently benevolent (Mr. Healy) or the most, menacing, evil creatures that have ever walked on two legs (Mrs. Healy, Bow Tie Killer), the outrageous characters that bounce around the screen are culled directly from a kid's mind.  The exaggeration immediately appeals to children (and admittedly, even at 17, I laugh at the slapstick moments even harder), but it also contains many sophisticated tongue-in-cheek moments for older audiences.  For instance, one of the funniest moments is seeing Mr. Healy's pedantic interests progress from an optimistic self-help-how-to-raise-a-kid book to The Exorcist.  I'll be the first to admit that although I shun most run of the mill mainstream movies, I'll never resist a opportunity to watch this movie whenever USA Network airs it, which is quite often.

And you know what? I actually liked it!!I thought it was well-crafted from a movie-making standpoint it moved at a rapid pace, never bogged down, it had excellent cinematography, vibrant use of colors, somewhat multi-layered plot, good background music, etc. So, yes, from a movie *craft* standpoint, I felt it was indeed a good film.I thought everyone acted their parts exactly as I would have expected - everyone was either slightly (or extremely) over the top, with the Problem Child himself being so extreme he was almost cartoonish. And really, everything in this movie was meant to be an exaggeration anyway. Examples I liked the way Mrs. Healy was constantly equating having a kid as being little more than a sort of magic ticket to a higher social status in the local neighborhood. I really liked Gilbert Gottfried's character, demurely informing the hapless parents (John Ritter and Amy Yasbeck) that Junior had been returned 30 times before THEY got ahold of him. And I liked Michael Richards, as the Bow Tie Killer (hadn't been with a woman in 15 years!), puttin' the move on the frustrated Mrs. Healy, and she was all over him!. (By the way, forget the kid - Amy Yasbeck was reason enough to see this movie (loved her hair!). I'd see it again just to drool over her!!)Anyway, I think you have to approach the movie for what it is a spoof and a lampoon of sorts. In that light, I found that it came across as a very clever, slightly (and slyly) cynical, spoof on parenting and child-raising.So what's the big deal? It WAS a good movie, pretty funny too. Let's all let our hair down for a change, get in touch with our inner naughty eight-year-old, and maybe have some fun with this kind of silly humor once in awhile.

It doesn't make much sense that even as a baby Juinor was a monster and the fact that he was adopted tends to tarnish that honored tradition, but this movie is so funny inasmuch as someone as young as Juinor has such a merciless sense of humor for such horrible practical jokes. The scenes at the orphanage I think are some of the funniest pranks he pulls off, but his escalation of his viciousness as he gets adopted is probably a bit on the far fetched side. Just as Juinor becomes too cartoonish, the style of the story changes as we see the results of his damage. John Ritter's degradation into a nervous fit is timed just right. Michael Richards' performance as the Bow-Tie Killer, though, is a bit subdued; sort of like Seinfeld's Kramer with an extra screw loose. Amy Yasbeck gives off a shrill performance as if she has seen too many episodes of Married With Children, and Gilbert Gottfried is a little under-used. He would have been a better foil for Juinor than Ritter. Michael Oliver, himself, in the title role has probably typecast himself as he rolls his eyes, mugs and laughs his demonic little laugh.

Secondly, I would like to say that I once loved Problem Child when I was 10 years old, and I still do even today.  Also, Beavis and Butt-head is also my favorite TV show of all time...  Problem Child is the first piece of entertainment of the '90s that fits into the category of no-brow humor.  No-brow humor is something that adults should find distasteful and something where a lot of the jokes are too sophisticated for kids to understand.  South Park is probably the most famous example of a no-brow show in the '90s.I would like to add, however, that many kids out there can handle a no-brow movie like Problem Child, I being one of them.  If you're a kid, in most cases, you realize that Junior is not a type of role model.  When I was watching it, I never once considered chopping off a girl's hair, stealing my parents' money, or any of the such.  I found it funny, though, and Junior is quite a well developed character.  Kids will realize he has been doing bad things since he was born, and that Junior will never be like any kid watching the movie.Most importantly, the values in the movie are right on.  The movie is about a kid that does bad things, but the moral of the story isn't It's ok to do bad things.  It's about a special father/son loyalty; it's about unconditional love.  Because every character in the entire movie is pretty despicable except for the father, the positive values shine out ever brighter than they would in an entirely typical, entirely positive family movie.  Perhaps I saw the movie at an older age than the kids that people that usually saw this movie I was 9 going on 10.  I think most people don't remember what being like a kid was like.  If a kid is too young, and I'm talking in mental years, don't take them to see it.  I think a well-raised child that knows not to emulate every action he or she sees on the TV screen could enjoy this movie every bit as much as I did and not be affected negatively.  A child that would be able to handle this type of movie should have a firm grasp on reality(important one), social-values, and the ability to follow a plotline.  And, in a pure Skinnerian view of the movie, Junior is never rewarded for the bad things he does.  An intelligent child should be able to tell that his father, who has genuine care and love for his new son, is angry at him when he does something wrong.  This, as much as anything, had a true effect on my as a growing 9 year old.

I consider the sequel to be the actual worst movie I've ever seen (check out my review for that one), but in all fairness, the first one is okay; just an average dopey movie.The premise of a mischievous little boy playing pranks is classic, from Dennis the Menace to Tom Sawyer. The character of Junior is much nastier and more mean-spirited than those kids, and the whole movie has a disturbed feel to it; for instance, a scene where he throws a cat at his grandfather and sends him to the hospital. One moment you'll have slapstick in the style of Home Alone, the next you'll have adult sex jokes, next you'll have sitcom-ish acting by John Ritter and Amy Yasbeck, and then for no reason, just random sentimentality where we're supposed to go aww that Junior and his dad are bonding.In another scene, Junior is playing a little league game...and ends up attacking all his teammates with the bat, sending them to the hospital. This isn't a funny like bit of mischief; this is out-and-out sadism a kid hospitalizing other children, and it's played for laughs! Eventually Michael Richards shows up and kidnaps the kid. Michael Richards? you'll exclaim, At least we know that he can be very funny. But he's given too little to do. The bumbling burglar character has also been used a lot in kids movies, specifically Home Alone. The thing is, this time he's a bumbling serial killer. Hmm, see what I mean that things are a little dark for a kids movie? I won't deny there are a few funny parts, such as a sight-gag with a fake uterus and the final joke with Yasbeck's character. I know the movie's also been criticized for insensitivity to adoption and orphanages, but I guess I'm not the right one to comment here.So, overall, it's a mediocre movie, but not a terrible one.

Who would take the idea of watching a malevolent little boy wreak havoc on others and deem it funny? The movie is not funny, ever, in any way, beginning to end. It wants to be a cartoon, but the writers don't realize that slapstick isn't funny when people get attacked by bears, or hit with baseball bats. It may be funny in cartoons, but not in a motion picture.The film's young hero is Junior (Michael Oliver) who, since he was a baby, has been placed at the front doors of foster parents for adoption. The families reject him, because Junior tends to give them a hard time.He is then thrown into an orphanage, where he terrorizes the nuns, and writes pen pal letters to the convicted Bow-Tie Killer (Michael Richards). He is soon adopted by Ben and Flo Healy (the late John Ritter and his wife, Amy Yasbeck), who are dying to have a child, in order to be just like every other parent in their neighborhood.Junior becomes a member of the Healy household, and Little Ben takes an interest in him, despite the fact that he destroys a camping trip by luring a bear onto the site, or throws a cat at his father Big Ben (Jack Warden), a bigoted politician.I think that we're supposed to care for Junior so that we can root for him when he gets his revenge on people. His new mother, Flo, is a bitch, his grandfather is completely selfish, and one little girl--who despises adopted kids--is such a spoiled brat.But what Junior does to get the last laughs isn't funny- -it's mean, cruel, and sometimes life-threatening.And what is the film's message? That kids should resolve problems with violence and vandalism? That they should seek friendship by writing to convicted killers? They definitely don't what it's like to be a bad kid. Junior isn't a one--he's just a sadistic, little twerp. There used to be a time when it was bad for kids to beat up others. Now, everybody's laughing when Junior beats up kids with a baseball bat.It's a shame that this movie has been marketed as a family comedy. What's worse is that Problem Child is rated PG. What was the MPAA thinking when they saw this? There's a lot of profanity and mean-spirited pranks here, that one may wonder about the dividing between the PG and the PG-13.Kids will enjoy this, but parents will be shocked at what is being depicted on screen. And to most people, Problem Child will be considered a guilty pleasure classic; a film that someone will shamefacedly admit to liking, even though the prevailing opinion, as put forth by more serious viewers, is that the movie is a piece of crap.

I just found it to be a plain bad, annoying film about a very, very annoying character. Judging from its all-too-obvious title and production (it looks like a low-budget late 80s/early 90s family comedy, which is what it basically is), I was expecting a cheap knockoff of Home Alone - and it's not like I liked that series either, maybe because I don't find anything cute about hell-raising little spawns of Satan, they're little devils who just tick me off and need to be disciplined.The problem is that &#x96; unlike, say, Matilda or even Kevin from Home Alone &#x96; this kid's just not likable or even particularly cute. Instead, he comes off as the movie's other characters describe him &#x96; a vile little spawn of Satan (the ginger hair, dead eyes, freckles and bad teeth only add to it) who delights in inflicting misery on others until way too late in the movie - it almost feels like the filmmakers decided that they needed to find a way to make the audience not woo for the little devil's death.The film unsuccessfully tries to walk a fine line between a violent naughty-child family comedy (a la Home Alone) or a semi-serious commentary on sensitive issues like abandoned children, adoption and parenthood. Instead, it awkwardly dips in and out of both territories. Adding to the stilted tone is the fact that in some parts it's actually quite dark if one bothers to give a below-surface thought to it &#x96; there's one particular scene where the defeated, blanked-out dad contemplates killing his adopted little devil while his wife fornicates with an escaped serial killer in the next room - in a PG-rated family comedy!Virtually every character in the film is paper-thin, overacted to the point of bad unintentional comedy and just plain disengaging or annoying. And my apologies to--let's see--Michael Oliver, who I'm assuming has now vanished in the dustbin of Hollywood's child actor has-beens (like most stars of such movies do), but here he's probably the most annoying kid I've probably seen in any movie with a child protagonist.Unless you've had a childhood with crappy basic cable channels that used to rerun movies like this one back in the 90s - even I caught this movie as a rerun on my crappy local cable (as they say, old habits die hard) - and as a result you have some kind of perverse sentimental value for it, there's no reason anyone should watch this, especially considering that that today (the Modern Golden Age of TV) there are so many great shows on TV to kill your time with.

How this film became a hit is beyond me because this is a completely inept and awful film. It's amateur hour from beginning to end as to its direction, writing, and acting.The plot a childless suburban couple consisting of a good-hearted, kind husband (John Ritter) and his shallow, social-status seeking wife (Amy Yasbeck) are conned into adopting the problem child of a Catholic orphanage. This repulsive child named Junior and played by the repulsive looking and utterly talentless Michael Oliver promptly turns their lives into a dysfunctional hell as he plays pranks on and physically assaults anyone who crosses him. Michael Richards in a pre-Seinfeld role makes an appearance as Junior's idol, a bow-tie wearing serial killer, and Jack Warden collects a paycheck playing John Ritter's creep-politician dad.Director Dennis Dugan, whose career has inexplicably spanned decades thanks to his long working association with Adam Sandler, either is completely talentless (a strong possibility considering his work with Sandler) or he simply didn't care (another strong possibility considering his work with Sandler). The performances across the board are unspeakably awful with the scenes with the kid actors appearing to have been done in one take with minimal direction. The performances of the various child actors shouldn't have passed muster for a grade-school play production, let alone a feature film! Still, the late John Ritter (a very likable actor) and Michael Richards were professionals and did what they could with their horribly written characters, but no one emerged with their reputations enhanced from this film. Due to being it being a surprise hit with undemanding kids, Ritter got roped into the even worse sequel but said never again to continuing on with the series.The ONLY redeeming value of this film is that it's so inept and so awful that its pure wretchedness actually may provide some unintentional entertainment value. One can laugh AT IT rather than WITH IT. Thus, I notched-up my rating to two stars instead of one. "},{"Title":"Filthy..

BUT..It had been done loathsomely this time, too loathsomely indeed, not only as a revolutionary move to shake things up a little, but also because the international taste wanted it eagerly at that very era.Look at movies like (The War of the Roses - 1989), (She-Devil - 1989), or even TV shows like (The Jerry Springer Show - 1991) and the time of their releases. Actually when vomit, excrement, semen, blood, along with bare old butts, ugly sex, etc.. became a reason to make you laugh, so this kind of works became a fashionable profitable thing to make ! Therefore it's not the desire to be different, it's the time when being polished turned into boring as well as unnecessary.After the end of the 1980s, bad taste established quite a personality in Hollywood to be assured branch of the comedy production, and a mode with fans all over the world. So instead of killing your parents or yourself, blowing up your home or else's, you go to watch problem child, man, bunch.. whatever the problem is ! At the 1990s and the 2000s, some movies took the revolution of the vomit to the next level, after adding some attractive factors to it as well; like good female nudity, sexual boldness, and forget about the drama, any drama; it's pure filth in glaring frame to have eventually examples like  Euro trip, American Pie, Kingpin, Freddy Got Fingered,.. (Refer to my comment about Euro Trip which entitled My List of The Most Disgusting Comic Movies Ever where I tried to analyze why we love this kind of movies even if we hated most of it !). I'm a screenwriter myself, and how I feel that making a toilet humor or any type of bad tasting is very much easier than anything else. Not because Hey it's the 2000s, and we're having very dirty minds already !, but ALSO because writing a comic movie which would make you think a bit became something not needed that much anymore those days ! So like (Problem Child)'s creed as one gifted god father of the genre; let's give them farts, let's give them nastiness, let's give them a child who extinguished the camp fire by the hard way.. And why not ? It's novel, distinct, and people will just empty their angry suppressed objections through it. In fact, the other sequels, especially number 3, reached the top of filth, and it's filth for the sake of filth more even for the sake of comedy sometimes ! Try to be reasonable.. OK. I loved the photo-montage of the birthday party's fiasco, the comic situation of (Jack Warden) telling the shocking truth unconsciously to all the TV viewers and his voters, the light parodies of (The Omen, The Shinning, Patton). But on the other hand, the performance was exaggerated, the laughs were violent and mean, the editing was nearly hysterical in a bad way, and the above-mentioned for sure..You can watch it as a turning point of the cinematic comedy, Hollywood thinking, as well as the international taste, or as a very important event according to the recent social anthropology. Or watch it to laugh and try to understand the real message of it  don't you ever think that much, otherwise you'll hate a lot of things, this movie could be one of them !

When I first saw Problem Child during it's theatrical release, I thought it was really funny at first.  Now that I'm older, I can say now that I am embarrased to have ever seen or even liked this movie and it's sequel that nobody wanted!      Kind of makes you feel sympathetic for John Ritter for even participating in this movie.  In other words, you'll feel sorry for the cast for being in this pathetic movie!  This movie isn't even for kids!  Or any age for that matter!  This flick makes children believe that anti-social misbehavior and acting like a little sociopath like Junior (Michael Oliver) is okay, fun and acceptable.      My best advice is to skip all three Problem Child movies.  Believe me, if you watch even one of the Problem Child movie trillogy, you will regret ever seeing it.

Dennis the Menace was cute. Let's just say that ANY movie for kids, about kids, whatever is better than this garbage. I agree that if you were under 8 when you saw this, you may have overlooked the sheer stupidity of its existence;  but that doesn't mean you can call this waste of film a kid's movie!I haven't enough energy to express my hatred for this movie. But I'll try as best I can.          This is a movie that is cliched to be a kid's movie, a copy of a copy, of....of a kid's movie, where kids are supposed to root for this demonic looking idiotic kid. But believe me, the kids who saw this are probably more confused than anything. Ask them WHY a boy, supposedly portraying a kid doing things THEY would do seems totally unrealistic to them. They would answer I don't know, but I was thinking the exact same thing!      I've always HATED this movie. Not because it's a bad example to kids, etc,etc. Because it assumes to make this boy look realistic and touching, (just because of a stupid ending to a stupid plot) and presume that all kids act this way. Well, kids are smarter than adults think, and they're not just going to like a movie because a fake-charactered boy they can't even relate to creates pranks just because kids think pranks are funny. Although <Home Alone> isn't too realistic in it's interpetation of 'Kevin', it's as real as it gets compared to this depression of a movie. I kept thinking a parody of icky Vicky, that dreadful girl robot from that scary 80's sitcom, would fall in love with this demonic boy and take him off the screen forever. I was hoping, anyway.   This is for kids who 'haven't seen the light' yet, or for adults who have never come into contact with a human child.-Sep "},{"Title":"Bad but WAY better than the sequel","Date":"21 March 2000","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family","Review":"  This movie is REALLY bad. John Ritter, Jack Warden, and Michael Richards all look embarrassed, and rightly so. The kid is a demon seed and does all sorts of horrible things. But there are two pretty funny scenes1.) The little bratty girl has a few unpleasant surprises coming at her at her birthday party. Who hasn't wanted to do something mean to the snotty little girls we knew in elementary school? 2.) When Junior drives the family car into the sporting goods store to the tune of Born to be Wild. For some reason, I think that scene is really funny.I was a Problem Child junky when I was younger. Now I can't believe how utterly awful Junior's pranks were and how dark-spirited the movies are. This one is WAY better than the sequel we were blessed with only a year later.

A comedy without a single laugh. A children's movie that I hated when I watched it at eight years old. A feelgood film that filled me with disgust and anger. The movie revolves around the adoption of the eponymous problem child - a vile piece of work who devotes his time to inflicting violence and humiliation on people who cross him, people who are kind to him, bystanders and animals. Yet the audience is expected to sympathise and feel sorry him, even despite the fact that he idolises a serial killer. Michael Oliver is completely wooden and unrealistic as the main character, but somehow this just makes him even more hateful. Everybody else apart from John Ritter play their poorly scripted parts as lazy caricatures, but this is actually worse for Ritter's character when he displays understanding and love towards the problem child he looks foolish and naive at best, and an enabler of violence and antisocial behaviour at worst. The problem child is never punished, and people never make much of an attempt to prevent him carrying out his misdeeds, even when he's hitting people with cars, getting them attacked by bears, or beating other children with a baseball bat while the adults stand around making faces. Just take the bat away from him! He's only about three feet tall! Twenty years later I still remember most of this film quite clearly, and whenever I see another film end with a repulsive villain getting away with appalling crimes, or a tyrant crushing the will of the only person willing to stand up to them, or whenever a complete monster walks to triumph over the bodies of innocents, the intended feelings of despair and loss are always mitigated when I think to myself Oh well, at least they were more sympathetic and likable than the problem child.

I can't say that about most Oscar winning movies. Problem Child introduced the excellent John Ritter to Amy Yasbeck. This movie brought them together in real life. I love John Ritter and now that he is gone, the movie is more sentimental to remind us what is lost forever. Of course, Problem Child has a great cast besides Ritter and Yasbeck, like Jack Warden as Ritter's father and of course the devilish Michael Oliver as Junior getting into all sorts of trouble. Not to mention Gilbert Gottfried as the adoption agent and Seinfeld's Michael Richards before he became known as Kramer as the serial killer pen pal of Junior's. I mean it is silly but I appreciate it at the end of a long day. Of course, it's funny and it reminds us what John Ritter meant to the world of comedy.

The people that have posted comments about how good this movie is either have a very low I.Q., or they're being sarcastic.  It's mind numbing in the sense that if you watch it you grow stupider.  It teaches kids that it is alright to do things that might kill people in real life because you will have a stupid parent that will never punish you.

A few of my friends and I decided to get together and see a movie, we wanted a comedy, and off we went to Blockbuster. We saw this on the shelf and said, This might be alright, let's check this one out. So, we rented it. Just for kicks. The movie turned on and we sat in total horror for the next hour or so. (One of my friends insisted that we continue watching it, saying to us It HAS to get better, maybe the brat dies in the end!) Well. It did not get better, and he did not unfortunately die. I was disturbed by this movie, I mean its bad when you start convulsing in a chair or start crying because a movie is so bad. I never actually wanted to kill someone before, but that kid, my god, I actually wanted to wrap my hands around his neck and hold on for several minutes, well after he stopped breathing and my fingers had left deep bruises in his neck. That boy is Satan. Never watch this movie, and never, ever, let your children see it. Like previous posts said this before me, HOW COULD THE FATHER JUST LET THE KID GET AWAY WITH THAT?!

I remember watching this when I was a kid, and can't decide if I would like it or hate it. Nowadays, that I know the differences between a good movie and a bad movie, I definitely know where this one goes. I'll make this quick, Problem Child is senseless, hokey and gross, but never in a good sort of way. I really am not looking forward to watch it again.The film suffers in miscasting and bad performances. Sure, John Ritter may be comfortable in such a role, but poor Jack Warden, he is sucked into a role that's unsuitable for a big name such as himself. But one of the most annoying thing about this movie is Michael Oliver, as the annoying adopted boy Junior. I hate almost all about that boy. His voice is atrocious and his antics, unbelievably annoying. Trust me, once you see that boy, you'll hate him for sure.But what startles me about this movie is the fact that a lot of viewers fancy this movie, despite how horrible it really is. Okay, it's funny sometimes, but eventually tiresome. The kid does it all because he wants to. I don't know who to hate more in the movie, Junior, or his enemies. But when I grew up, I knew, not who, but what to hate most. The movie itself.Okay, if the kids want it, buy or rent it, at your own risk. But trust me, it's a waste.Rating 0 out of 5.

No, he is not so much a brat, as he is a kid with severe emotional problems. A nice couple looking to adopt get rather suckered into adopting him and while the husband is a bit more willing to give this kid a chance the mother is not. Through in a bizarre Michael Richards character and the always annoying Gilbert Gottfried and you have yourself a rather bad movie with a few laughs in it here and there. I actually prefer the sequel to this film as I like the fact they brought Amy Yasbeck back as a different more likable character as there are one to many characters in this film that are thoroughly unlikable as it is. Even the kid is rather annoying at first in this one, and they kind of chill him out in the sequel too. The plot is simple enough though as the prospective parents go to adopt this kid that they think is great by the way the orphanage is throwing a party as they depart, they soon realize they have themselves a little hellion. Add to that this little hellion getting into contact with a convict of some sort. Not sure about this character, at first I thought it was supposed to be his real father or something. Not all that good, but I will pick this ahead of that Culkin kid any day of the week.
