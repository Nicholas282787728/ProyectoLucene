I hadn't really begun to appreciate foreign film yet so I had no idea what to expect. What I saw was an angel beyond description giving one of the greatest acting performances I had EVER seen, still to this day. This film is heart-wrenching in it's beauty and romantic tragedy. In fact it makes art of it. I went back to the theater to watch it six times, I even dragged friends along. Yes the film was brilliant, but what I went back to see was perhaps the most beautiful woman I've ever seen on the big screen. Isabelle Adjani's beauty in this film is breath-taking and her performance is one of the most intense and deeply moving in history. I have this film on VHS and DVD. I still love to watch it.

The scene where Rodin touch her art in the dark and leads him to a scene where their respective egos fight each other, discovering the deep scars let by their devastating passion is an highlight of acting. At his level, it can be compared to sunset boulevard or a streetcar named Desire.

I am amazed anytime an actor or actresses changes physically in the part of a film (and without tons of make-up and special effects, either!)and Adjani does this remarkably well! We as an audience are just as stunned as Eugene Blot when he finds Camille drunk and spiraling into the depths of madness. Her appearance is nothing less than shocking.The film as a whole is engaging with a whirlwind of emotions--rage, sadness, torment, bliss; by the time the nearly 3 hours are up, I am exhausted. Adjani and Depardieu are part of that emotional energy as they passionately go at it--sex, sculpture and anger; especially when it comes to the latter. It is almost worth it to stop reading the subtitles and listen to them rage and lash out at one another.Adjani is powerful in so much of this film...I am amazed she didn't receive that best actress Oscar she was up for. Her torment and pain is riveting--especially in French. I am glad they did not decide to dub this film into English; hearing Adjani sob and ask Pourquoi? Pourquoi? would be empty with her mouthing the words Why? why? in English.The film as a whole is a bit long, but overall is stunning. The sad epilogue is even sadder if you know that Claudel's remains were interred in a mass grave after her brother Paul failed to claim them from her original grave the asylums only interred bodies in individual plots for a certain amount of time; space was at a premium. So, the brilliant Camille Claudel's remains ended up in an unmarked grave mixed in with others who went unclaimed, as well. "},{"Title":"  Wonderful!

She fails not so much because of her tendency to make fatal mistakes but because of the shape those mistakes took in her mind.   This, even as lesser personages prospered (e.g., Camille's brother Paul, the famous Catholic poet and diplomat) because they were not adverse to espousing convenient beliefs for the sake of earthly success.   Many viewers will feel a strong affinity with Camille, not because they consider themselves geniuses but rather for the interior world she constructed that, without religion, gave the exterior world meaning.  I say she was without religion, but in fact sculpture was her religion--at least until her final failure to gain the respect and patronage of capricious buyers.  It was then that her religion (her meaningful myth) took the form of a conspiracy delusion.  Powerful people, she thought (mostly, the sculptor Rodin, who had been her lover), were out to get her, thwarting her every move.What we experience here is a thoughtful, scary exploration of the darkness that is a paradoxical part of all brilliance.

The imagery and soundtrack is lush, and the story focuses intensely on Camille's perfectionism and fortitude, all the while depicting her descent into madness, although some claim she wasn't mad, merely a woman ahead of her time, and thus ostracized.From what I have read of various biographies of Camille Claudel, I understand that she was a woman ahead of her time; she scorned the bourgeois, just as many artists, writer, and musicians did -- in the same way that modern artists scorn the common, small-minded, and narrow society (read Hermann Hesse's Steppenwolf for a good understanding of the artist's situation in society).Following the pattern of Vincent van Gogh and Franz Schubert, Camille Claudel was not a great promoter of her works, and, to make things worse, the bourgeois society, just like today, failed to understand her art (again, like the plight of Vincent van Gogh and many others).At her core, Camille Claudel was a true rebel, not because she wanted to be, but because she had to. Camille Claudel was a true artist, in the very deepest sense.

In any gallery in which they were exhibited they snapped heads; there are few figures that speak with such authority or superiority, mute testimony, like the Easter Island figures, to as much effort and skill.  And so the movie `Camille Claudel', in like fashion, snaps heads in its understated power and commitment to craft. 	  	Like Ansel Adams, Rodin stretched nature beyond what was possible &#150; they both showed us something that was not there and in the rendering made representations so striking they had no precedent and thus set the bar higher for subsequent generations of artists.  As history played out, the far less well known sculptor Camille Claudel made substantial contributions but her tie to Rodin (and eventually her personal decline) for a period in the late nineteenth century is the focus in this instance.  In truth, her story demanded to be filmed; she stands a remarkable artist and most importantly the passion, talent and influence (inarguably on Rodin) she possessed went well beyond the `colorful' label oft attached to the gifted. 	Historically, this film is probably not a bad representation of how events turned in her life.  There are many issues and turns, and years for that matter, the details of which remain unclear to this day.  But in its entirety this is a marvelous interpretation of the record.  And without doubt Isabelle Adjani was the right actor for the job.	 Stunningly beautiful, there are few women in history as arresting as Isabelle is; certainly Camille was not as lovely, but the resemblance is darned good as compared to actors chosen to portray historical figures in most movies based on true events and the people that were part of them.  That Adjani brings some of the passion is certain.  After all, bizarre, or at least socially unacceptable, behavior resulted in her eventual incarceration, so we know she was a handful.	Many of the key points of her upbringing are addressed; her father's stern and inconsistent yet lovingly supportive position in her life (this is more forcefully impressed on us as the years progress); her mother's complete non-support and dismissal of all that Camille does; her relationship with her less understanding and conflicted brother.  But it is the period when she meets and falls for Rodin (and he with her) and their consequent tumultuous affair runs its course that is actually the focus of the film.	Gérard Depardieu's contribution as Rodin is probably the best work he has done.  He looks (Rodin was 40 when he met the 21 year old Camille) very much as Rodin did in this period of his life.  His love for his work, Camille and promoting his own career are his passions.  We are lead through the minefield of his own making (his inability to get off a dime and marry Camille is their eventual downfall) and we are not totally sympathetic to his behavior.  But this is the stuff of real life; as Seneca said, all art is but imitation of nature and both his and her own work convey their conflicted convictions.          	The musical score haunts us, as it should, right from the opening of the film.  Almost never detracting, it instead correctly underscores certain points in the narrative; but it is the opening where we see Camille scooping clay from beneath a Parisian street (and this is a well-crafted sequence) where we feel the upsurge of powerful currents operating.  The music heightens our interest as we determine exactly what we are seeing.	Other nice touches in the film include an occasion where Camille and Rodin together study a model on a turntable, spinning the model about as metaphor for the emotional maelstrom gathering momentum.  We also see a great moment when Rodin is caressing Camille's face, intercut with shots of him working clay into an as yet unidentifiable sculpture.	What follows the breakup of Camille and Rodin is essentially a retrospective of the downslide of a remarkable talent.  The story of Claudel's own diminishing output of work and the steady erosion of her inability to cope with reality is frightening in its telling.  At a meeting with Rodin some time after they have parted company she remarks that she has changed, and offers that `Nothing that's monstrous is foreign to me'.  And so she truly (and sadly) withdraws into a world of her own making.	Rating Four Stars.

His presence is, to say the least, commanding. Watch the scene, when Rodin visits the family at their cottage, where the two lovers half-hidden behind curtains indulge in their lust in the front of the tableau, while father Claudel slaps his son at the background. This is crucial, for two reasons it displays that the actors here are working as an ensemble, and that the steeling and always, thoughtfully, underplayed tension between father and son, cuttingly explain Laurent Grevill's portrait of Paul Claudel as a believer's thrust undercut by a profoundly melancholic repression and the guilt of the witness who spills into being an onlooker. This is, perhaps, the grimmest intuition the film offers us in terms of the artist's relation to his place in society.All this is brought to sublime heights when Alain Cuny recites some verses of Paul Claudel not one of the film's tensions is left out and, yet, the instance breaks out of its context.

Claudel is at first naive and young, falling for Rodin and his grandiosity, he declares her work genius, but gradually undermines her spirit and mental health. We see a foreshadowing of his envy when he first meets Claudel, and comments that at least she still has a passion for her art, which he has lost long ago.The photography of the stark and cold Paris studio in February is haunting, we feel the cold as Claudel sets up her clay in the crumbling white studio, with no heat or fire. Paris is freezing in February.Claudel's family denigrates her ambition, except for her brother who empathizes but cannot really help an aspiring female artist (unheard of, and certainly a bane to Rodin's ego).Eventually her unraveling begins, as she feels Rodin is conspiring her downfall; Claudel had suffered a form of paranoid schizophrenia, interesting that as a female artist she garners less sympathetic reviews than the ego-maniacal Picasso or misogynistic Man Ray.Overall this film is a do not miss which deserves 10/10 for tackling a difficult and painful subject some would rather turn a blind eye toward women artists in history.

Isabelle Adjani won the Silver Berlin Bear at the 39th Berlin Film Festival in 1989 for her role in this film which tells the story about French sculptor Camille Claudel (1864-1943) and her relationship with impressionist sculptor Auguste Rodin (1840-1917) who became her teacher and lover during the early 19th century in Paris, France before the First World War.With warm, colorful visuals, atmospheric music and detailed milieu depictions, this precisely filmed character-driven drama finely captures the era it portrays and the development of an historic figure who became a true artist. Isabelle Adjani's interpretation of an ardent and self-disciplined young woman raised in a middle-class family who struggled with her art and with her love is remarkable, and so is Gérard Depardieu's performance as the love of her life Auguste Rodin.

This is a richly deserved nomination for a foreign-language actress. The many layers she presents are stunning... Claudel was a very young woman when August Rodin (Gerard Depardieu, also great)took her under his wing. Stubborn and possessed of a magnificent gift for artistic vision, Claudel was not what most at the time considered a serious artist. Rodin even used her to do his work, taking all of the credit. They fell into a deep, passionate love affair, which ultimately would be Claudel's undoing. If anyone does French, period-film obsessive love the best, it's Adjani! (Check out the Story Of Adele H., if you don't believe me!). She ages from eager young visionary to jaded, drunk old hag. Dissolving into paranoia, some quite valid and some just plain crazy, Camille has some of her greatest scenes toward the end of the film, especially when she tells a gallery owner that she is afraid to leave the house because she's afraid she will be robbed. It's haunting, brilliant acting. Showing the viewer how hard it must have been to be a female artist during this time, the actress shines.She was the Courtney Love of the turn of the century painters set, and Adjani does her justice completely.

BOTH characters were based on real women, both lived around the same time period, both were French, both suffered the same fate and both completely lost contact with reality and their personalities disintegrated in the end.In the case of this movie, Camille suffers from Paranoid Schizophrenia (with signs of Disorganized Schizophrenia as well), as her problems in life all are the result of August Rodin and people that work for him to help him destroy her career. While it is obvious from the movie that Rodin was a slug and mistreated her because he was a narcissistic, beyond sleeping with her and casting her aside, there was no plot by him to ruin her career. But, unfortunately Camille created an involved delusion that this was so--blaming her failures on him and not the fact that she was erratic and acted crazy (living in filth, having the entire first floor of her home flooded and doing nothing about it, etc.). I liked how Adjani handled this but I was especially impressed by the makeup people who made her look very haggard and old--she looked the part.This is NOT a feel good movie by any stretch of the imagination. However, it is well-made and compelling and well worth seeing and a good study of mental illness.NOTE TO PARENTS--the film has quite a bit of nudity.

'Camille Claudel' suffers from the same intrinsic problems as its predecessors ('Entre Nous' comes to mind). Too much style ... not enough substance. Make no mistake folks ... this is a very lavish (read expensive) production. Perhaps that is the problem. Too much time and money spent on production design and cinematography and not enough time on script development. This is supposed to be a character driven piece yet somehow the 'story' just gets lost in all that grandeur. It's only during the last 3rd of the film do we we actually get to see any sort of 'performance' from Isabelle Adjani. For the rest, both her and Depardieu are minnows lost at sea in a maze of bloated film sets awash with moody lighting.Yes .. the cinematography IS breathtaking so kudos to Pierre Lhomme. I beg to differ with other reviewers about the musical score tho. It's one of the worst i have endured in recent times. More often than not it seems to be totally out of place (and out of context) to the scene we are witnessing ... almost as if it had been scored without actually *seeing* the film.I cant help but feel how this story would have been handled by a director with some understanding of the nature of art, but more importantly ... the ARTIST. Those having seen Jacques Rivette's 'La Belle Noiseuse' will understand. And for those interested in Depardieu driven historical pieces, seek out (the hard to find) Le Colonel Chabert. He's performance in that film is exquisite.This is an overly melodramatic film and a sad waste of money. They could have made 3 films for what this one must have cost. Not recommended.

This is an excellently photographed film, rich in detail, with marvelous acting. It is also totally depressing and way too long.I thought Isabelle Adjani's beauty was heart-stopping - absolutely luminescent. Those eyes, that skin - she is one of the great beauties of all time. That depressed me also, in the age of Brittany and all the other blonds. I suppose it's the foreign versus American perspective but give me my druthers, and I'll take Adjani's looks -- and presence -- any day!This story is being made into a musical by Frank Wildhorn for his wife, the beautiful and talented Linda Eder. I can't imagine a worse subject.

Skip it at all costs. Please, for the safety of others, do not watch this film. If by sheer chance you do pick up this film and you have not realized it, call HAZMAT immediately. Let them know that you have seen or are holding this film and you will need an amputation immediately. Keep your hand in cool water, and wait with a bottle of anything until the paramedics arrive. I promise, it will be all over soon!Grade * out of *****  "},{"Title":"A Sleeper","Date":"21 June 1999","Score":"0 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, History","Review":"  I saw this movie and thought it was a sleeper.  Sometimes I can get into intellectual Romantic movies.  This movie just did not move me.  I felt like it was about one hour too long. Camille is portrayed as a very sympathetic sculptor, who loses just about everything.  I thought the whole movie was just sad, and downcast.  If you like tragedies, you MIGHT like this. I just thought it was too long, which meant it has many unnecessary scenes, which ultimately lead to about one hour of boredom.  I would not recommend this movie.  If you want to see a good romantic tragedy go watch Titanic. "}]
