If you allow yourself to identify with the Patricia Arquette character, you will find it to be a very moving story of a woman regaining a sense of purpose to her life, and finding a new will to live.Arquette's performance is brave because it is purposefully wooden -- it's a way of defining her character's spiritual death, her complete lack of a desire to be alive.  She moves through life like a zombie because her family has been murdered and she can't see the point of living.  What is moving is how in the course of the story, she is reawakened -- by the Burmese landscape, by the beautiful quality of its people and landscapes, and by the primal choices she is forced to confront.Boorman supports this visually (and Hans Zimmer supports it with one of his most gorgeous, haunting scores) with an often static camera and with a propensity to shoot through glass, windows, windshields, etc.  We are on the outside looking in, just like Arquette.... until she finds herself deep in the jungle and is forced to choose whether or not to fight for her life.I recommend the 1954 movie THE PURPLE PLAIN as well.  It's a similar story in a similar setting, and makes for a fascinating comparison.

It's often difficult to do make a political point and still tell a good story (consider the highly political but rarely-entertaining final season of Ellen). Beyond Rangoon finds a good balance between politics and storytelling.I already knew that Aung San Suu Kyi had won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, and knew something about the oppressive political situation in Burma, so the political message of the movie was mostly a dramatization of what I already knew. But I thought the movie did a good job of telling about Aung San Suu Kyi and the mostly-faceless dictators who have for years tried to silence her. The device of presenting an unfamiliar setting through the eyes of a character that viewers can identify with is fairly common, but it's quite well done in this movie.Of course, the real measure of the movie was its entertainment value. Arquette was excellent as a young woman whose sister took her to a distant, unfamiliar place to shake her out of her depression over the violent deaths of her husband and son. She is convincingly detached and depressed. Her grieving condition gives her a clear reason for her distracted wanderings into the thick of a dangerous situation she does not understand, something she'd otherwise be much too intelligent to stumble into.Once the dangers become so obvious that she can see through them even through the cloud of grief, she's trapped, with no easy escape. That sets her on a path of adventure where she needs her intelligence to survive. The writers deserve much credit for making her intelligent and resourceful enough to deal with numerous dangerous situations, while still finding a plausible reason for her to be foolish enough to get into trouble in the first place. The directing is strong also, keeping up the tension throughout the race to escape the forces of the dictatorship.This movie had additional impact on me and my wife because of other events of the same time period. We were preparing for a trip to India, and heard news reports of Western tourists who had been taken hostage by a terrorist group in India. Avoiding isolated terrorists in a peaceful democratic country is quite a different matter from escaping an oppressive dictatorship. But the movie and the news shared the element of avoiding danger in an unfamiliar country. That common characteristic gave the movie meaning beyond the strength of its own skillful storytelling. The movie illustrates the international tourist's worst nightmare.

While there, she becomes entertwined in very real political upheavel. The film depicts the marches and rallies and protests realistically, and shows massacres that are hard to watch, but need to be heard. The political upheavals that really happened in Burma in 1988 were never heard or talked about in the US, and needed to be. Aung San Su Kyi was a woman who was trying to bring Burma (Now Myanmar) to democracy, but was denied by the government. She still tried to lead her people to freedom, and the struggle still exists today. The film has powerful writing, directing, cinematography and acting. The absolutely chilling and powerful score by Hans Zimmer lends riveting power to each scene, and fills triumphant moments with triumph. Patricia Arquette portrays the American, Laura Bowman, with depth, very frozen by the horrors of her loss, I tried finding something in those stone statues, but nothing stirred in me. I was stone myself, but slowly she sees the meaning of her life and others in her journeys throughout Rangoon and beyond. A terrific film. And it needs to be watched.

From the traumatic opening to the uplifting ending, you will be amazed at how well put together this film is. Patricia Arquette amazingly portrays Laura Bowman, who we meet as a shut-down and quit despondent young doctor, unable to deal with her grief over the loss of her husband and son. Throughout the course of the film, as she is trapped in Burma, witnesses the Democratic uprise and massacres in the capital city of Rangoon, flees for her life, and saves her tour-guide's (U Aung Ko's) life, she is regaining her will to live. This may seen contrived or heavy handed it is not. John Boorman, a master at spiritual and emotional conflict, paints the film with broad strokes, and often uses symbolism to capture Laura's emotional state, and physical predicament. Patricia Arquette, as usual, gives a wonderfully convincingly and believable performance as the emotionally wounded Laura. What Arquette does amazingly, in any role that she plays, is give us a window into her character's heart without words. Every time she is given a close up in the film, the audience is given insight into her character. She does not need to speak to convey emotions, or be over the top. Some critics were harsh on Arquette's performance in the film when it opened on August 25, 1995, deeming that she was flat or dull in the role. I found her characterization dead-on, staying well away from the melodramatics that typically are part of an actor's performance when having a personally tragedy take place. She is on shock and is reserved about her feelings that is just as normal as screaming lashing out at those around you. I am hoping that Warner Brothers releases this title on DVD very soon. With Arquette's hugely successful NBC drama Medium bringing her to household name status, not to mention an Emmy win and now 2007 nomination, it would be in the studio's best interest to do so. Hopefully there will be extras, with the alternate ending. Do not by pass by this film. It is one that you will certainly not forget after seeing.

First The blue-screen shooting is terrible with many darklines still left around the actors, this is most visible when they are on the raft in the river. Second The movie is too short. This movie is only 1h 35min and that is too short for a movie of this kind. Because of its shortness it fails where movies like Killing fields and Salvador triumphs. It is impossible to unite with the actors and actresses world in so short a time and therefor one only looks at this movie and don't feel anything about the horrors that it is supposed to make you upset about. But there is at least one thing good about this movie and that is the performance of Arquette - very convincing and colorfully done, but why didn't you give her an other half hour to give us more depth?

They seem to rely on emotions, sometimes clichéd (not always a bad thing, and you do handle it well, in that your people say what one would expect a person to really say in that situation, even if it has that feel of a cliché), and lots of water and green vegetation, mud, earth, breath in the cold, dragon's breath, stuff like that.Your films remind me of David Lean and David Attenborough, which makes sense, but, as you would probably agree, more dreamy.A possible misgiving is an expectation set up with your stuff that right away tips me in a certain direction, and takes away possible surprise.Not so with Beyond Rangoon, which I found was beyond the others you have done that I am most familiar with (Emerald Forest, which I need to see again, and Excalibur).Beyond Rangoon is the story of one woman set against the backdrop of events in Myanmar (Burma).  The story makes no attempt to give us a comprehensive picture of those events, just an introduction, but it is a solid introduction.

I always like Patricia Arquette, and her leading man in this film is just great. Actually, she's the lead in this film, and that is what is great.So much of the film is told with film language, that is, images, that I can see some critics being a little impatient with it, but it is probably because they overanalyze and find it fearful to feel anything too deeply.Anyone out there wondering if this movie is worth it should watch it to find out.

All the fire of his blazing courage and outrage are blended in this incredible portrayal of the dilemma of modern Burma. There is probably no military dictatorship anywhere in the world more brutal than that of Burma, which surpasses even the unlamented tyranny of Saddam Hussein for cruelty and sheer evil. It was like that when this film was made, and it is still like that now, 16 years later. Nothing has changed except that Aung San Suu Kyi is 16 years older. She is played delicately and to perfection in this film, in a brief and moving scene where she gracefully walks up to soldiers pointing rifles at her, brushes them aside, and passes on. In a sense, she is not just the Conscience of Burma but the current Conscience of the World. For she remains faithful to a cause which the world has heartlessly abandoned. Because there is no oil in Burma, it will not be invaded by the United States, Tony Blair will not go there with his pious platitudes and grin of a madman, BP will not ruin the coastline, and the arms industry must be content merely with selling guns for the population and 'rebels' to be murdered, not for invading troops to be opposed (what a pity there is less need for tanks and fighter planes, not to mention drones). Why is it that the Burmese population are so thoughtless that they allow themselves to be shot with simple rifle bullets, so that cannon shells are not required? The Burmese military really are bad customers, they kill on the cheap. But of course, like the Nazis, they get plenty of raping and torture in first, as what fun is it being a vicious brute if you cannot lord it over the people you are about to massacre before you do so? Even a Burmese soldier has his vanity. The most amazing performance in this film is by a Burmese man whose own name is the same as that of the character he plays, U Aung Ko. This is the only film in which he ever appeared, according to IMDb, so he was not an actor but 'a real person'. (Note do real persons exist on screen outside of documentaries? This is an existential question for cinéastes.) In trying to find out more about this man, I googled the name and discovered that there is another U Aung Ko, actually U Aung Ko Win, also known as Saya Kyaung, who is closely connected with the present sinister regime, probably a relative but certainly not the same man as our hero in the film. Then I discovered that our hero lives in exile in Paris, having left Burma to live in France in 1975 (where he had previously studied at the Sorbonne), where he is married to a French woman, has assisted in the preparation of a documentary film about his country's plight, and works as a translator and language teacher. So that's who he is. The other lead in the film is Patricia Arquette, who gives a magnificently stalwart and powerful performance and clearly endured a great deal of physical hardship in doing so. The two of them work very well together and generate significant chemistry (not of the romantic kind but of the rarer kind based on understanding and friendship), which helps make the film such a spectacular success. Frances McDormand appears early in the film as Arquette's sister who has to leave her behind because she is forced to leave Burma with a tour group while Arquette is stranded while she waits for travel papers from the incompetent US Embassy. McDormand is, as usual, wonderful, but then she is one of our most admired actresses, who never disappoints. Arquette has been widowed and is recovering from intense grief, and as a result of her amazing adventures which ensue 'beyond Rangoon' when she gets out into the countryside (officially barred to foreigners), she finds a new meaning and value to life in helping others. Several of her companions are killed along the way. There are many excellent performances from young Burmese, or actors who play Burmese, since obviously this film could not be made in Burma (it was filmed in Malaysia and Thailand) and several of the players are really of diverse ethnic backgrounds. We see many horrible massacres and rampant violence and oppression taking place continually. Unfortunately, though many films with an axe to grind have tended to show these things for tendentious purposes, in this case I fear it is all too true. It does not appear that one can exaggerate on film any of the atrocities committed either by the Nazis of Germany or the Burmese military of today. This film really should be shown in schools. It is such a powerful lesson about the real world, so inspiring and horrifying at the same time. And yet those same parents who are content to let their kids sit around all day watching meaningless blood and gore on the screen with fictitious 'action heroes', and play computer games where everybody gets rewarded for killing other people (is that sick or what?), would doubtless complain because there are many grim real life situations portrayed here. Such is the 'hypocrisy of suburbia' into which real life rarely enters. We should all be giving copies of this film to all of our friends. And if the politicians were not all such thickos, they might even do something about the West's foreign policy.

Still I have an excellent digital VHS copy in English with subtitles and Nicam Stereo so my qualm is more one of principle than a frustration at not being able to view the film. As to the film itself, this is an excellent all-rounder with good picture quality, more than satisfactory soundtrack, lively plot involving suspense, emotion, sadness, frustration, feeling good and exotic surroundings ( for a European ). How true the film fits in with the reality in Burma I have no idea, indeed, that is less important, the essential thing is that entertainment-wise, it is a success. One soon becomes attached to each of the main characters and I admit to having my heart in my mouth during the final crossing-the-river scene. It's a shame we hear so little about countries such as Burma and this film at least gives some insight into the country. Has the situation changed since 1995 ? The events which are to occur later this month seem to answer this question with a resounding No and the regime in place seems to be as brutal as ever, not even sparing the lives of monks, let alone women or children !

The story line is gripping, and the inner and outer journeys are paralleled carefully and delicately both cinematically, and in the story line. I've watched this film at least six times, and it really holds up to scrutiny. It is particularly relevant today, given world events. Check it out, you won't regret it!

A holiday to Burma with her sister seemed like a good idea to get away from it all, but when her passport was stolen in Rangoon, she could not leave the country with her sister, and was forced to stay back until she could get I.D. papers from the American embassy.  To fill in a day before she could fly out, she took a trip into the countryside with a tour guide.  I tried finding something in those stone statues, but nothing stirred in me. I was stone myself.  Suddenly all hell broke loose and she was caught in a political revolt.  Just when it looked like she had escaped and safely boarded a train, she saw her tour guide get beaten and shot.  In a split second she decided to jump from the moving train and try to rescue him, with no thought of herself.  Continually her life was in danger.  Here is a woman who demonstrated spontaneous, selfless charity, risking her life to save another.  Patricia Arquette is beautiful, and not just to look at; she has a beautiful heart.  This is an unforgettable story. We are taught that suffering is the one promise that life always keeps.

However a midnight walk brings her into the middle of a student demonstration where she loses her passport.  Left behind by her tour group she begins tour of discovery through the troubled country led by U Aung Ko.  She discovers a world of atrocities that have not been exposed to the media.There's no denying that there is a great story here &#150; it is a powerful tale of injustice, military rule and massacres that happened away from the public eye.  However this film does not really tell that story.  Instead it focuses on an American doctor on holiday in Burma who allows us to see all these things.  However it comes across like it's about her rather than the country.  She is seen as the most important character and we have a subplot about her overcoming the loss of her family in the US.  It takes away from the central story and makes this feel like a soap.Of course it needn't have been like that.  It's only a terrible, flat, lifeless performance from Arquette that does this.  She is so flat that it's hard to care about her and it comes across even more like a soap.  She gives us shock, self-righteous indignation etc all under a monotone voice over than made me want to sleep.  She manages to come across as more important than everyone else in the country and it's as she only sees events in terms of how they affect her.  Outside of Arquette the support cast are good &#150; U Aung Ko in particular, but McDormand and Grey are OK.The film continues with Hans Zimmer's standard `Far East' score (compare this to Black Rain to see what I mean) and Arquette discovering herself and spuing philosophy everywhere.  However at the end the film acts as a metaphor for why the US didn't know about events in Burma &#150; because no one cares about massive deaths unless a Westerner is involved.  We see in on the news everyday &#150; hundreds killed in a third world country is relegated to the end of the news, after a story about what Brittany was wearing that day!  But if one American was killed then it would be the lead story with politicians running from all corners to comment on it.The film manages to take a terrible, emotive story and make it into a beautifully shot drama about one American woman who only sees things in terms of how they affect her.  Boorman has a good try but really needed a much better actress to lift the script. "},{"Title":"A powerful story.

I felt a complex mix of feelings about the people there, something like compassion and admiration at the same time, together with a bit of rage because I feel that no one, neither the countries of the world, nor themselves, is doing anything effective to end this shame. I think these feelings became directly from the movie, and that they were intended when it was made, so it is a successful movie. The desire for peace, the quest for enlightenment, the respect for life sometimes leads to subjugation. In fact it is the Buddhist Burmese culture who has left the doors wide opens to their dictators. But, how can you feel angry about these poor people?

While it definantly isn't the greatest movie, or even one the best movies of it's kind (The Killing Fields is better) it does at least attempt to tell a necessary story.I think the method of introducing Laura into Burma was a bit contrived. First of all, Burma isn't exactly the easiest country to visit, especially in the late 80's.  Secondly, if you did make it Burma, your passport would not get lost.  A sane person would make darn sure they knew where their passport was at all times. With that in mind, I'm sure the screenwriter knew that was weak, but needed something.  Patricia Arquette's performance was understated, and I just didn't buy that she was a doctor.  However, at least she didn't overact the role, which often happens in movies like this.  U Aung Ko was good, but also understated. The end is hard to follow, since most of the dialogue is in Burmese, with people translating for Laura.  It would have been difficult for Laura, and is difficult for the viewer as well. Another plus is the strong SE Asian scenery in the film, which was enjoyable to see.  "},{"Title":"Sad...

There are lessons to be learned here.  One of Patricia Arquette's lines sums up on.  To Americans if it didn't happen on TV it just didn't happen  There is a lot of truth to that.Another is that at one point she thinks that just because she announces she is an American Citizen that soldiers will part and let her pass.  It doesn't work that way.The scenery is beautiful.  The acting is all decent.  THE PROFESSOR is especially good.  Mainly though I care about these characters.  Francis McDormand and Spaulding Gray are fine but their appearance is short, so they don't matter much.  Patricia has guts.  In the hands of a lesser actor this could have turned out very badly.  As it is love or hate the movie you should still come away with the idea that there still exist military dictatorships in the world in this century, and until one of our own is hurt we ignore their oppression.Aung San Suu Kyi, is the female political leader in the movie.  In real life she won the Nobel Peace Prize.  She was only recently released from house arrest. The W. Bush administration, as of the date I write this, is attempting to pressure the military government to engage in talks with her and re-form the government.  The Burmize government was under such scrutiny that is changed the name of the country to the Maynamar Republic.  The U.S. Government has yet to recognzie the new name.If you don't wnat a message in your movie don't watch this one.

The rest of the cast as well as the photography keeps the film at an acceptable level. Not so the music from Hans Zimmer, which, as often happens in other films with his music, one senses the plagiarism as he wanders about from cuasi-Isham to almost Vangelis forms; Boorman's directing was rather loose at times and some poor editing did not help.  Notwithstanding all this, the film maintains interest precisely because it is Burma &#150; now Myanmar &#150; which is the true protagonist of the unfolding story &#150; not the actors. It is the tragedy of Myanmar, hardly ever in the headlines, that keeps interest for the discerning viewer.A second viewing of this film recently confirmed this way of watching the film for me.I was in Burma (then) in 1971 rebuilt Japanese war vehicles converted into little buses ran the streets of Rangoon; nearly a quarter of a century later Boorman was filming the same vehicles! From the fabulous insult of Shwé Dagon north to Pagan and Mandalay and east to Karen country around the lake at Inlé, repression was evident at all times. The poverty of the filthy streets in the capital with open drains and sewers &#133;&#133;&#133;.. and amidst all this the incredibly beautiful British colonial architecture of the Government house presiding over the mess. The Shwé Dagon pagoda displays that magnificent heritage of 10th and 11th Century Burma as well as many others around the country, but is an insult to the peoples striving to live in the ruins of a despotic régime.If Boorman sought to illustrate this, pity indeed he did not do it 25 years earlier. But whilst the mixture of races &#150; Indians, Bangladeshis, Laotians, Karens and other indigenous Burmese races &#150; continue to suffer, but the repression does not affect interests of other nations, above all the US, there is no Nobel Prize which will change the course of events, and no film will do it either. With its back to the world, shut in inside its frontiers, the tottering régime stumbles on in no direction, stagnating in its own mire, and shunning anything anyone may say or do about the situation.So you can see that my interpretation of the film is rather tainted, a very personal point of view. But do not be dissuaded the story line maintains a certain coherency, though at times Patricia Arquette running and running and running at times had me almost laughing.

This is a kind of cinema a great deal of people will, in full honesty, describe as important. And that's fine and all, but...come on, folks, just admit it Patricia Arquette ruins the entire thing. The story is certainly an important one, and its Hollywoodish, romanticized treatment is a cheap price to pay for making casual western moviegoers aware - not necessarily of the actual history or anything, but of the simple fact that Burma is a place that exists in the world and that, by the way, its people live under a repressive military dictatorship.The locations are gorgeous, and perhaps the cringeworthy moments of maudlin, hamfisted romantics and the unintentional shadow of colonialism (this is pretty much the opposite of the subaltern speaking, and if you think about it, PatArq's character's decision to insist on visiting the countryside was motivated by selfish reasons and possibly resulted in at least one person needlessly losing his life) can be excused by the fact that this was made during Clintontime, pre-911 and all that. But there's no excusing PatArq's terrible acting. Maybe I didn't see it on a big enough screen or something, or maybe it compounds with the fact that this movie feels downright dated, but she should have focused more on playing skanks who wait tables at diners until they are swept up in some criminal scheme by a poorly-shaven dude. Her doctor was about as believable as lawyer in the entire Legally Blonde franchise. I could go on and on, but who needs another paragraph lambasting PatArq?In the end, there's just not enough crab in this Rangoon for me to recommend it off the Boorman menu.
