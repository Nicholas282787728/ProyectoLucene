Not that I have seen them all, and not that there's much competition. This was such a dreadful year in Hollywood I'm swearing off Oscar day. But this IS an amazing film (as is Girlfight). Let women direct more, I say, and let budgets be slashed in subatomic particles. Most importantly, let people who have stuff to say, say it. All the other ones should wait for inspiration.One of the amazing things about this film is its pace. It is breathless, and you never quite stop laughing or gasping or having some variety of intense edge-of-your-seat emotional reaction. Which is amazing, because the plot is so complex, it could easily have gotten lost in chaos. Even as you laugh, the tension doesn't let up. The stories unfold rapidly and dramatically and with full comic timing, and you never quite stop marveling. We are not treated very often to this kind of inventive filmmaking.If you've lived in LA for any significant length of time, you'll realize from the start that this film is not meant to be realistic. The MTA scenes at the beginning are so un-LA, so colorful and happy, you know this is going to be a grand fest of the imagination and the heart, not a tale of urban life. (For one, people on MTA buses tend to sit dejectedly, not to have a collective laugh&lovefest). Similarly, the ethnic angle is more life-as-we-would-like-it-to-be than life-as-is. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. In fact, it's so refreshing to see race on film without having to trudge through misery, pain, and blood, you want to weep with gratitude. What's Cooking? is full of big themes treated with similar lightness broken families, same-sex relationships, tradition vs. progress, parenthood, urban violence, gender roles, politics... Even as it packs it all in, the film does it all seamlessly, treating it as the stuff of everyday's life it in fact is (funny how movies tend to deal with one issue at the time, and how we've grown to consider that a good thing).But lightness is not glibness or superficiality. There's a big heart and a big sharp mind at the center of What's Cooking? and problems get taken seriously. Clearly, since this is the world as we'd like it to be, most things find some sort of satisfactory conclusion by the end. And that is more than all right, because we're tired to see gays and people of color go down, families drown in waters to thick to negotiate, and all the vast repertoire of disasters that make critics think a film got it right. Nope. Not here. But the world as we'd like it to be can still be a POSSIBLE world, and this is ultimately the exhilarating nutshell of What's Cooking? that joy is not beyond our reach, the pain can give way to healing, and that, hell, we can, maybe not perfectly but nonetheless, all get along.Well done!

I first saw it four years ago when my sister was home from San Diego state for Easter vacation and we rented the DVD the following day from Blockbuster. Some of the most talented names in film (Oscar-nominee Alfre Woodard, Oscar-winner Mercedes Rheul, Lainie Kazan and Joan Chen) and up-and-coming talent (Dennis Haysbert of FAR FROM HEAVEN and the ALLSTATE commercials) star in this terrific ensemble film with a brilliant script and first-rate performances most notably from Woodard, Rheul and Kyra Segewick. The story (set throughout the Fairfax district of L.A.) revolves around four different families (focusing primarily on the women of each) all of four different ethnicities one African-American, one Hispanic, one Jewish and one Vietnamese and the family conflicts they deal with over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Woodard's family is dealing with a marriage that is on the brink of a divorce with two subplots of an extremely irritating mother-in-law (Ann Weldon) and a troubled son in his early twenties; Rheul's family is confronting the fact that she has separated from her husband (Victor Rivers) and has moved on with her life and has a promising relationship with her boyfriend (A Martinez) despite what her son wants. Kazan's family is up in arms with her daughter (Segewick) involved in a lesbian relationship with her recently married life-partner (Julianna Margulies). Chen's family is most definitely the most dysfunctional while their daughter is involved in a relationship with a young white boy, their eldest son uses his midterms schedule as a false pretense to avoid coming home for the holidays and is seeing Rhuel's daughter and Chen's teenage son has been suspended from school for stealing a test while also being dangerously involved with a gang. One highlight of the films is where Woodard's friends come over to her house for Thanksgiving dinner and their rebellious, uptight teenage daughter wants nothing to do with any of them. When confronted by Woodard's mother-in-law about what she and Woodard's little daughter and her friend are doing, she states that we're playing Thanksgiving... she's the mommy, she's the daddy and I'm the alcoholic, cult-worshiping, Satanic stepmother! The story moves in a very transitional pattern alternating between the four families with very interesting scenarios for each. Gurinder Chadha (director of BEND IT LIKE BEKHAM and the upcoming BRIDE AND PREJUDICE) has really outdone herself with the unique and oft-times exasperating ties that bring these families together. Another engaging aesthetic in this film (possibly the most important) is the incredibly diverse variety of delicious food each family cooks throughout the midsection of the film in preparation for the holiday tradition. You can almost smell the enticing scents of the apple and pumpkin pies and the turkey and mashed potatoes as well as the Asian and Hispanic dishes. The special features on the DVD of the films offers six different recipes as they were used in the actual film.This is one film that my whole family and I love to watch every year on Thanksgiving and one we watch throughout the year as well. Go rent it sometime this weekend and see what you think. I really think you'll love it!

It follows four families (black, Latino, Jewish, and Vietnamese) during their holiday celebrations, with all the messes that crop up during big family gatherings. Each of the families has its own problems, which are to some extent intertwined.An example of one of the family messes A young man in the Latino family bumps into his father (who had moved out some time earlier) at the grocery store, and invites him to Thanksgiving dinner. His mother is furious, because she doesn't want anything to do with her estranged husband, particularly during a big holiday event.The acting and directing are very good, but the writing and editing are really wonderful. The cast is huge, but the editing manages to make it easy for the audience to keep track of everyone. It's full of laughs (and some light drama), but aside from some stereotyping, mostly realistic. Even though there are quite a number of name actors, the screen time is divided among the cast to fit the story, not to fit the actors' egos -- an impressive balancing act for the director and producers.The food scenes, aside from a few kitchen disasters, were enough to inspire quite an appetite. It's a good thing the Seattle International Film Festival scheduled the screening in the afternoon, so I could have dinner right after the movie.This is one of the best recent comedies I've seen.

More often than not, these little reunions manage to bring out the worst in people and unpleasant episodes from the past get dredged up and brutally dissected for the thousandth time.  Or your parents may take turns pushing your buttons (which of course they programmed in the first place) and endlessly aggravating you with a never-ending barrage of life questions.  When are you getting married?  When are we getting grandchildren? What do you intend to do with your life?  Small wonder that the suicide rate increases exponentially around these times of joy.Rather than limit herself to one family's deluge of dysfunctional dialogue at Thanksgiving, writer/director Gurminder Chadha, zooms in on a multi-family multicultural view of the holiday.  We are introduced to the Jewish family with the lesbian daughter and her lover, the Hispanic family with the philandering husband and newly liberated wife, the cross-generational Vietnamese family's struggle with old traditions vs. new realities, and the successful yet fractured African American family. Happy holidays!Unlike The Big Night where food is intended to inspire pure sensory decadence, or Like Water for Chocolate in which it takes on a mystical, magical quality, Chadha's uses food to illuminate the contrasts between the families in the piece.  While turkey is served as the main course at every dinner table, it is prepared, cooked and presented very differently by each family.   The roasted polenta, fajitas, spring rolls and homemade macaroni and cheese that supplant the side dishes typically associated with Thanksgiving - corn, cranberry sauce and mashed potatoes - further enhance the feeling (and reminded me that I had missed dinner).  But movies do not live by food alone.What sets this film apart from its contemporaries is not its parallel, intertwining plots, or the setting, but its execution. Any of the plots could easily provide enough fodder for a full-length movie, which makes their skillful amalgamation in 106 minutes that much more impressive. This is more remarkable when one takes into account that no one in the voluminous (there are dozens of speaking parts) and talented ensemble cast is there as window dressing - every character is solid and has a clearly defined purpose. Rarer still is the fact that the lion's share of screen time is devoted to the development of strong female characters, which might explain what drew Mercedes Ruehl, Julianna Marguelies and Joan Chen to the project. My praise has not yet ended.The dialogue is realistic and well written, and the situations, though sometimes tongue-in-cheek, familiar and believable. The pacing is quick, slowing down to take a breather only when the audience needs it, but never leaves the viewer behind.  The editing is tight and clean, rarely allowing any one scene to run too long.  Finally, the cinematographer deserves congratulations for the exceptionally sumptuous food shots, I swear I could smell the turkey.  In movies, as in life however, nothing is perfect.The movie does lapse into stereotypes in several instances, for example, could anyone be as truly annoying and clueless as the character of Aunt Bea (played to wonderful excess by Estelle Harris)?  I hope not.  The film also goes to the sentimentality well a little too often and the ending, while clever, is contrived.  While noticeable, these flaws are merely mildly distracting, and do not overwhelm the film.As the saying goes, I laughed, I cried, I cringed, it was an experience. * Make reservations to catch this delectable dish as soon as it's served up at your local theater.*I didn't actually cry, I just got a little something in my eye.

Is it weak to want to hold the family together? So many holiday or family gathering movies (like Avalon and Hannah and her Sisters and Eat Drink Man Woman) have been made by men and they always felt off balance to me compared to my observations and experiences. Here the women in the kitchen are symbolically and functionally at the center of the meal preparation, the meal and the families. Other women directors have been successful at portraying a single ethnic group's family issues, such as Double Happiness or Nancy Savoca's True Love. But this is a multi-ethnic All-Americans Thanksiving in L.A. (reminding me of the children's book Molly's Pilgrim) an L.A. where people from different traditions (Vietnamese, Chicano, African-American and Jewish) all integrate the trappings of the Pilgrims into that basic of ethnic identity--food-- to intersect in unexpected ways, at work, in the community, in their homes and in their hearts.It's an impressive cast of actresses in particular; it's noteworthy that such a stellar cast would do a small indie -- clearly they jump at the chance to get meaty roles for women.The audience laughed, and cried, and gasped.

But underneath, we see also the similarities of the joys, pains, and struggles as the various families deal with the reality hidden beneath the holiday veneer.As the family members connect with and disconnect from each other and with members of the other families, the surface is pulled away, and we see what is really underneath the pleasantries and polite facades. This is a very accurate depiction of the sadness and humor that surround family holidays, and the film might be a good thing to watch just before or during such holidays.

The powerhouse actors portraying gentle characters were magnificent. The way the stories perfectly combined shocked me, and the movie kept me very intrigued and put a smile on my face all way through. In LA, on Thanksgiving day, four multi-cultural families deal with their dysfunctional relatives.In the Avila family, a Hispanic-American clan, Elizabeth's (Mercedes Ruehl) son, Anthony (Douglas Spain), invites his estranged father Javier (Victor Rivers) to dinner. Meanwhile, her daughter Gina (Isidra Vega) has invited her boyfriend Jimmy (Will Yun Lee), who is Chinese.In the Nguyen family, an Asian-American clan, Trinh (Joan Chen) is always in a battle with her daughter Jenny (Kristy Wu), who has found a gun under the bed of her brother's (Brennan Louie) bed.In the Williams family, an African-American clan, Audrey's (Alfre Woodard) **SPOILER** husband Ronald (Dennis Haysbert) was having an affair at work. Meanwhile, their estranged son Michael (Eric George) has quit college and come home for Thanksgiving, to celebrate with Grandma Williams (Ann Weldon) and the Moore family (Shareen Mitchell, Gregory Itzin, Mariam Parris).In the Seelig family, a Jewish-American clan, Rachel's (Kyra Sedgwick) parents (Lainie Kazan, Maury Chaykin) can't deal with her being a lesbian with Carla (Julianna Margulies), and must hide the secret from Aunt Bea and Uncle David (Estelle Harris, Ralph Manza).I must begin by saying all of the principle actors, except Kristy Wu and Julianna Margulies, did an amazing job.Mercedes Ruehl gave a stunning performance as Elizabeth, a woman who couldn't go back to her cheating husband. Douglas Spain and Isidra Vega did excellent work in their supporting roles, while Will Yun Lee brought smiles to your face all the time.Joan Chen was magnificently wonderful as a Vietnamese woman who wants to stick to her Asian customs. Kristy Wu is a terrible actress, but her acting doesn't rain on this parade of a movie. Brennan Louie had a truly minor role, so there's not much I can say about him.Alfre Woodard was so damn amazing that I was about to lose my mind, she was really good. Dennis Haysbert was nothing out of the ordinary, but decent. Eric George had a very minor role also, but he did good. Ann Weldon was very entertaining and I would have loved to see more of her. Gregory Itzin and Mariam Parris had small roles, but Shareen Mitchell, in the small amount of time she was on, was jaw-dropping amazing and a huge scene stealer! Kyra Sedgwick is a great actress and she really pulls this role off. Lainie Kazan and Maury Chaykin are absolutely flawless&#151;there's no way you can't love them. Julianna Margulies did a horrible job. She was obnoxious, stupid, and one-dimensional. Estelle Harris and Ralph Manza had small roles, but they acted them out hilariously.I must say the writers of the film handled each family very well, never giving the audience too much of one. Thanksgiving is a difficult time and just because it's Thanksgiving now&#151;not everything is all happy and peachy. The film portrayed that message greatly.The most intriguing family was the Williams one. It had very well-put together plot lines and it was delightful to watch the actors, because they all did wonderful. They were the sort of 'perfect' family that had it's problems revealed piece by piece.The next most intriguing family was the Seelig one. Kyra Sedgwick was the glue of it and everyone, except Julianna Margulies like said before, turned in really good performances. The lesbian issue is handled very well and there are some gentle scenes of joy.The third most intriguing family out of the four was the Avila one. Mercedes Ruehl left a huge impression in her role and so did every single person that had anything to do with the Avila plot. The story-line is interesting, although at times there are senseless scenes.The least intriguing family is the Nguyen one. It's the least intriguing, but still very intriguing. Joan Chen's performance raises it to a solid 8 on my list and the supporting cast, besides the intolerable Kristy Wu, did great. The stories were a bit dramatized, but it was still good.ALL IN ALL What's Cooking? is my favorite movie of 2000 and if there's only one movie you can see from that year&#133;make it this one!

For the Nguyen's part, the parents try to keep the traditions of the grandparents while worrying about the acculturation of their children. In the Avila household tensions arise when one of Isabel's children invite her estranged husband to the same meal that she plans to unveil her new boyfriend. The Williams family have Audrey trying to keep a whole raft of secrets from her visiting mother-in-law. At the final house, an elderly Jewish couple struggle to come to terms with their daughter's lesbian partner while also hiding it from their visiting sister and brother-in-law. As the turkeys finish cooking, things come to a boil at each of the meals, resulting in tears, hurt, fights, revelations and some healing.This is a rather ambitious story that doesn't quite manage to rise above the level of melodramatic soap opera but still produces an enjoyable and busy film. The film focuses on four family dramas &#150; each of which could have been a film in there own right with good writing. The decision to make this an ensemble piece with no one story dominating the running time means that the film is never dull but also reduces the penetration we make into the characters and lives in each case. This reduces the emotional involvement we can possibly feel because the stories are fairly superficial and the characters are tick boxes rather than coming across as convincing people, and their problems are fairly simple and not as deep and involving as they could have been. However, even if this leaves it as a more professional daytime TV sort of movie, it does manage to avoid the syrup sentimentality of those sorts of movies and is the better for it. The collection of stories may well mean that I never was moved that much by any one of them, but it did make the film easy to get into and kept it moving and busy.The cast really helps as well; none of them really has the material to shine but they are part of making it feel professional (as opposed to the overwrought delivery so common in tvm's). Woodward, Haysbert, Chen, Margulies, Sedgwick, Ruehl, Harris etc, all give solid performances and help make up for the deficiencies in detail in the material. The way they all work together within their specific stories is important to and I felt that they all did well with what they were given even if the material wasn't there to allow any of them to really deliver anything approaching a barn-storming performance.Overall this is a film that it is easy to pick holes in because it doesn't really excel as an emotional story because it has so much to cover but it does do each story well enough to keep the film moving, engaging and enjoyable. Nothing earth shattering then, but a warm story with enough going for it to make for a good film with solid delivery all round from the talented and unshowy cast.

The lesbian couple was one of the acts of pandering and could have been more realistically replaced by something more pertinent to a Jewish family. As the movie progressed I was able to look past the blatant pandering and look at what I thought was the basis of the plot. It never occurred to me that this was an attempt to show the multicultural diversity in one city or our country. Instead, I thought it was a good look at human nature in general, regardless of culture. Somewhere between Martha Stewart and Norman Rockwell we have developed an idea of what the perfect Thanksgiving and Christmas should be. We take this perception and then create it in accordance to our own specific culture. We think that certain foods are required and everyone will get along. As we all know the perfect Thanksgiving is only an idealistic goal very seldom achieved. Thirty minutes into the movie I was depressed because I have been through similar holidays. Maybe not with the same circumstances but nonetheless marred by burnt food, family arguments, etc. I thoroughly enjoyed this and would recommend any newlywed couple planning to host a holiday dinner for their combined families to watch.

The Vietnamese family is dealing with their teenage daughter's hormones, their younger son's school troubles, their oldest son's sense of family, and their youngest son's pure stupidity (although this kid's sub-20 IQ is not acknowledged, it's a vital component of the tension at the end) The Hispanic family is dealing with a cheating father, and the African American family is dealing with marital and father-son issues.  All these problems are studied in depth with a sympathetic eye.With the exception of the two Asian teens (Kristy Wu and Jimmy Phan), the acting is really good.  These two seem to think thrashing about aimlessly is a substitute for emotion.  While there are some stupid characters in the movie (e.g., Anthony Avila who sides with his cheating dad), their motivations are generally logical and well-developed.  Mrs. Avila (Mercedes Ruehl) is especially impressive in her strength, emotion, and empathy.On a side note,  I don't know if you've seen immigrant families, but the parents generally don't have time to work out 5 hours a day to look as good as they do in this movie.  They're too busy running video stores and such. This and the barely-noticeable accents of the Vietnamese grandparents, are glaring distractions in a movie that tries to show the reality of multicultural life in LA.The movie wraps up in that annoying typical Hollywood ending with the bad guys suddenly realizing the errors of their ways and making amends with the people they've wronged.  If a big-budget movie ended like this all the critics would be up in arms about it being a pandering feel good piece of Hollywood drivel.

This time...theres no need...but i WILL be off to see this one again if not again ) I admit i knew little of What's Cooking and to be honest i like it that way. Going into a film with no pre-conceptions. I guess i expected a fairly average 'done before' story line and boring underdeveloped characters. Well...scene one...i was sold..this movie is fantastic.I love the way that What's Cooking draws on a somewhat universal experience- in Thanksgiving, while at the same time highlighting that this one day is so very different for people. It chose to show this difference across a spectrum of cultral backgrounds The Asian family struggling with tradition, the Hispanic family dealing with a family breakdown; the African-American family facing infidelity and rebellion and the Jewish family struggling with conformity. Strangely through such different stories it was plain to draw something from each one and relate back to your own experiences.This i think was one of the strongest points of this movie....it deals with something that most people are familiar with. Holidays with family that we love to hate and hate to love! The holidays that we can't wait to end but then can't wait for them to come around again. Even in the music score this was reflected (listen for the 'same but different' tune!)differently by all but still in many ways the same.The characters were perfect..you felt you knew them- again i think it comes down to relating back to your own experiences... You could take something from each one. I think that he cast was brilliant. I couldn't single out a single performance..this one was a team effort that paid off in a big way. Of the whole movie i would pick maybe one scene that seemed 'off'. The revelation at the Jewish table seemed to be played a little out of context of the characters. It just didn't seem right i guess but other than that i loved everything about this flick! i loved the movie, i loved that it wasn't predictable, i loved the music, the feel, the atmosphere, humour and warmth.It's not very often that you go to a movie and sit for the whole time with a smile on your face and if it wasnt that in this one it was an equally moving emotion. The best way to sum up this cleverly structured peoples piece is that it is incredibly warm. I had tears in my eyes for practically the whle film from laughter, fear, anticipation, sadness or a little bit of everything all at once! That in itself signifies the imense depth this film created from its inocent simplicity of just looking at life and people at their best and worst! I liken it in many ways to 'Playing By Heart' in its structure and insight into everyday people issues, but this film was far better in its reach to the audience and more powerful and sublte in its storyline.

In this case, an ethnic Thanksgiving stew that simmers, always with good taste, until it is very well done.  Director Gurinder Chadha illuminates a vast number of characters (a whopping 41 speaking parts) bathing them in the warmth of a vision that brings every individual to palpitating life.  The families' foibles are portrayed with so much humanity that the audience surpasses ethnic boundaries to identify with them all.  And Chadha shows us, in the best way possible - by example - how to embrace, and delight in, the diversity we find among  the groups, within them and, consequently,  within ourselves, too.In this film, the food prepared in each family circle for Thanksgiving marks and defines not only collective differences and affinities but individual preferences and dissensions, as well.  The dinners are lovingly prepared, sumptuously presented and equally tempting in many quite original ways, so much so that I was moved to suggest to the producers that a cookbook would be a logical item to promote in conjunction with the film.   Not at all surprised, they responded that work on such a book was, in fact, underway!I think Chadha should earn an Oscar nomination as best director for this film and the cast a nomination for whatever award exists for best ensemble performance.

The images touch sensory memories that extend the visual vocabulary. It is both enjoyable and intellectually satisfying. But this pedestrian film fails to evoke those memories.The Joan Chen connection seems one worth following. She is sort of a minor phenomenon, which I first noticed with `Autumn in NY.' that film's subject was just as unremarkable as this. But it was so well constructed I spend all my viewing time marveling at the craftsmanship. As an actress, she's understated -- a contrast to the hispanically demonstrable Ruhl, but very apt. A study in dramatizing the Asian woman which is quite a challenge since the starting point is deliberately undramatic.

But somehow it fell short of my expectations.  It gave us four ethnic families, but failed to give us some depth to the material.  The film's take on issues is often too shallow to serve any lasting, meaningful merit on such an important cultural topic.What most critics failed to see is that the truth is, most people have very little idea about many other cultures in this world.  So we just accept what we see on the screen.  Perhaps this contributed to the flawed script, which pigeonholed the families into what we might expect from families of African, Hispanic, Jewish, and Vietnamese decent.  Mind you, it seems though that the writers are trying to be as politically correct as possible, and the genuine attempt on being culturally diverse (which many people appreciated, including me), the film is marred slightly by the lack of true, unbiased understanding of different cultures.  Hence, the result looks like a bunch of families living out their stereotyped stigma.  I loved one scene around the African-American dinner table, where the girl reminded everyone that today their families can enjoy eating Turkey, but at the cost of real Americans who suffered colonialism.  It was the best scene of the film, and unfortunately it was a very short scene.The script needs a bit of polish, and has only touched the tip of a bigger iceberg.

We see four families ñ   Jewish, Latino, Vietnamese and Afro-American as they prepare for   Thanksgiving. These people have done alright ñ they live in a   comfortable leafy suburb in Los Angeles ñ and there is a turkey on   every table. (Actually one turkey is hors de combat but the Colonel   comes to the rescue). Each family has its own domestic drama to play   out as the bird cooks. The Jewish Princess comes home to the Seelig   household from San Francisco with her lesbian lover, the latino son,   coming across his estranged father in the supermarket, invites him to   the celebration to his mother's dismay, a couple of kids have formed   cross ethnic romantic relationships unbeknown to the parents, one of   the Vietnamese kids has got himself into a gang and an Afro-American   kid has taken direct action against one of the politicians, who happens to be his dad's boss.    The story is told with a great deal of cross-cutting, but is easy to   follow and the strong ensemble cast are generally very believable.   Maury Chaykin who is only 48, is totally convincing as Herb Seelig, a   doddery gentleman who seems to be at least 70. Mercedes Ruehl as the   sultry and fiery latino mother and Joan Chen as the Vietnamese mother   are also impressive. Estelle Harris makes an appearance in the Seelig   household (as George Castanza's mother, it seems). Her fortunately   small part is a total caricature which stands out like a sore thumb   against the other solid, measured performances.    The director, Gurinder Chadhan who is Anglo-Indian, wrote the script   with her L A born Japanese-American husband, Paul Mayeda Berges. She   has the outsider's eye but resists judgment of her characters. They are   all nice people anyway ñ no crooks or criminals on Thanksgiving, though   there's plenty of teenage angst.The food at each household is a study   in itself, turkey being the only common dish, and it was fun to decide   where I'd most like to eat, once the domestic dramas were over, that   is.
