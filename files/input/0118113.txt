These characters really act as if they are best friends.  One great accomplishment of this film is that it is about everyday events which are transformed into having importance because we see the characters giving them importance, without it being heavy-handed.  Another is the dialogue these people are comfortable being cynical with each other, without being mean spirited.  This is a small film with a big heart.

After some years they have met again as adults and their friendship has a different kind of meaning to both, if anything it is stronger than before. Whereas Amelia has found love and is graduating for a professional career as a therapist, Laura, on the oder hand, has found a job in a newspaper, but her love life leaves a lot to be desired.Nicole Holofcener, the director, takes us to meet these two women as they go through their lives in present day Manhattan. Having seen this film when it made its commercial debut, we decided to take another look after almost ten years of being released and we can report the film is still fresh and quirky as when we first saw it. The director, whose Lovely and Amazing was also a worthy successor, treats her subjects with a light touch and the result is a film that gives the viewer a good insight about human relations in a cinematic form.The best thing going for the film is lovely Catherine Keener, who is an asset no matter what she is playing. Ms. Keener seems to be a natural for the movies. The camera loves this actress who has a style of her own and who, in comedies such as this, makes perfect sense as her directors clearly capitalize on her uncanny sense of how to play the quirky characters in which she has excelled.Anne Heche, on the other hand, makes a perfect Amelia come true. Ms. Heche is a good actress that always brings something to the roles she plays. Amelia, the young woman in this film, is at a point in her life where she has to make decisions about her relationship with Frank, who clearly adores her, and her own career as a therapist.The supporting roles are basically the men in the two friends' lives. There is Frank, who is living with Amelia. He wants her to commit and marry him, but she has doubts before she says yes. Todd Field makes a good impression as Frank. Bill, the video store clerk likes Laura, but feels betrayed when he hears a message Amelia has left on the answering machine where she calls him ugly; he takes offense and decides to drop Laura. Kevin Corrigan is perfect playing this man. Finally there is Andrew, an old flame of Laura's who has broken up with her some time ago, but has remained friends. Liev Schreiber is good in this part.Walking and Talking shows a talented Nicole Holofcener at her best. The film shows us a director who knows a lot about the complicated balance of the relationship between two caring friends.

Anne Heche is - as always - on great form; and Liev S is very good too. A lovely little movie, often a little too low-key for its own good.

Good characterization, realistic dialog (no slap-stick cheap tricks, farce etc.) and capable actors.I have seen Friends With Money which was a disappointment compared to this and Lovely and Amazing. This film succeeds because we care about the characters, Anne Heche as the therapist, trying to control her wedding, Catherine Keener as confused and disappointed single again friend. Andrew and Laura (Schreiber and Keener), Frank and Amelia,(Ann Heche and Todd Field) two couples just trying to make things work. They have to find humor in minor things. Kevin Corrigan adds humor as Keener's sometime date, who finds out he is referred to as the ugly guy.Liev Schreiber adds a good element to the film. Keener's former boyfriend, he is there for her, even as she pursues Corrigan who works at a video store...Jeez look at him...I thought I could relax for once... Keener says as she wonders why he has rejected her.This has been compared to Sex and the City, but there really is no comparison. A one hour TV show vs. film; this film has resonance; we will remember and want to see these characters again, they are not cardboard cut-out characterizations. TV has to be more polarized, due to the medium and time limits, hence the characters are more superficial and obvious.(Could we picture Kim Catrall in this film, I don't think so). I am surprised Nicole Holfcener has not surmised this, and realized the casting mistake in Friends with Money; if someone has a too-TV persona, they do not necessarily translate to film. That was one of the problems with FWM.Also the performances in this film were not preceded by the personalities. Heche is believable, amusing and sympathetic. Catherine Keener is quirky, interesting and multi-layered. Liev Schreiber is funny, a good friend and we want to see more of him. Please, Ms. Holofcener, for your next film use film actors, not people who had a high TV Q or were married to a film celebrity for a brief period. It makes a great deal of difference, and the finished product proves this to be so. 9/10 "},{"Title":"A precursor to  Sex and the City","Date":"9 January 2005","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Hip, witty, likable precursor to Sex and the City. The film has a Woody Allen feel, but with a 90s feminist slant. Set in New York City, the camera follows the romantic trials and tribulations of its two lead females (in two exquisite performances from Keener and Heche). The dialog is bristling with insight and vigor unlike many films of that era that Hollywood mass produced as so -called romantic comedies. Yet this film is much more than a romantic comedy. Inspired by Woody Allen's more intimate and small-scale New York films, it adds its own voice to that tradition. This is definitely on of the better indie comedies of the 1990s, and stands the test of time even after the demise of Sex and the City.

Therefore, losing her childhood friend Laura (Anne Heche) as a roommate has been tough. Laura has moved in with her boyfriend and is on the verge of becoming engaged. That hurts, as Amelia has not had good luck with men. She is forever phoning her best friend, nevertheless, for advice and for support in coping with life's problems, from a sick cat to a former boyfriend/pornography addict (Liev Schreiber). Laura, a counselor, does her best to be available for Amelia, but wedding plans and minor tifts with her intended leave her with less free time than ever. Will Amelia learn to just stand on her own two feet, for goodness sake? This is a quietly thoughtful film about friendship and its boundaries. Keener is wonderful as the friend who relies on others to help her through life's ups and downs. Even the most cherished friendships need room to breathe and Amelia has to learn this the hard way. Heche is likewise very fine as the beautiful lady who appears to have it all but may, in fact, have some flaws, too. Todd Field is great as Laura's fiancé and Schrieber gives a nice turn as a commitment phobic, sexually obsessive addict. All of the production necessities, from costumes to sets to direction, are quite nice. Then, too, the script is quirky, funny and original as well. No, this is not a thrill-a-minute adventure, so those who eschew slower paced, dialogue-driven films will want to skip over this one. Yet, if you adore romantic dramas brimming with life, humor, and important statements, here is the film you've been looking for. Walk to the nearest video outlet and peruse the shelves until you grasp this little gem in your hands.

Keener is perhaps not the most versatile performer, but she's always compelling on screen and even just being herself is more than enough.Holofcener has a way with actors coaxing credible and funny performances from all. It's a very talky affair with not enough meat on it to make a lasting impression. But her talent is crystal clear.

Although Keener is cranky throughout, she eventually proves to be an interesting, supportive friend.The performances are all terrific. Mr. Corrigan may be most memorable, as the horror movie geek Keener labels The Ugly Guy; watch for an outstanding scene as he overhears a message on Keener telephone answering machine. Some back-hair might have helped him look more ugly, though. Then, again, hairier Rafael Alvarez does seem prove excessive hair isn't so ugly. Wonderfully ironic to see Randall Batinkoff (as Peter) play a waiter so well, and an actor so poorly.

Never a dull moment. The film avoids sliding from comedy into tedious sentimentality, and this is due to the fact that it's an independent film and not one of those Hollywood formula comedies that run out of jokes halfway, then hide behind clichéd boo-hoo-hoo crap. Only the last few minutes get a little schmaltzy, but not in any sort of irritating way. The film is more down-to-Earth than some other films of this kind; it avoids pretentiousness creeping into the dialog - the script's aim being to be humorous and not preachy. The only pity is that the film is rather short. Many funny scenes, a lot of which stem from a very original approach to humour; the biopsied-mole-gift incident, Corrigan laughing about a cat having cancer, a patient who lies about his problems just to be interesting to Heche, Keener renting out pornos for her ex-boyfriend, Keener refusing to finance her ex-boyfriend's high long-distance sex-on-the-phone phone bills, Keener getting upset at Schreiber after he honestly answers her question about why they split up, Heche complaining to her fiancée that their sex-life is getting predictable (+ a detailed description of why it's so), Keener refusing to even consider the idea of an execution of my cat (very funny wording), or - one of my favourite moments - Heche's fiancé referring to hers and Keener's music as vagina music (i.e. the sort of 90s American-generation-X-girl-on-guitar, acoustic plinka-plonka, trite, oh-so deep, and utterly uninspired and dull radio crap, practiced by such talents as Heather Nova, Lisa Loeb, Jewel, and the like).

So if movies that are in the 'thirtysomething' mold aren't to your liking, don't stop here. (The star, Catherine Keener, even looks like she'd fit in perfectly on that TV show.) On the other hand, if you like nothing better than a film that revolves around characters and their relationships, I don't think you'll go wrong giving this one a try.How you feel about the film will of course be determined by how much you care for the characters, and I found them likeable enough to give it a positive rating. Amelia (Keener) is the confused one here, who doesn't want any more than a platonic relationship with her longtime male friend, and can't figure out why she can't get a worthwhile relationship going with any other man. Her best friend from childhood is Laura (Anne Heche) who seems to have everything that either of them wants as far as a relationship goes. Laura is soon to be married, which doesn't help Amelia's frustration any.The movie doesn't ever get overly serious about things and stays enjoyable throughout. Keener is fine in her role and Heche seems to do well in every film she's in. This is a strong first-time effort by the writer/director, Nicole Holocener. I think she made the film she set out to do. It will be interesting to see if in the future she has anything more or different to say.

'Walking and Talking' is the first slice of life film from the same director who's made gems like 'Friends With Money', 'Lovely and Amazing' and 'Please Give'. All films mainly focus on the relationships of women. The center of 'Walking and Talking' is the friendship between Amelia and Laura. Holofcener and her actors Catherine Keener (a regular in the director's films) and Anne Heche do a superb job in depicting a friendship that is not always about hanging out and partying.What Holofcener portrays is a bond that has changed throughout the years for these two women but become stronger than before. They are open to each other, honest, judgmental without worrying about hurting each other. Feelings do get hurt but at the same time it is this honesty that is the strength of their relationship and what gets them through the tougher times.The director has cast Catherine Keener in all her feature films and has done so in distinct roles. In all these films, Keener's character is searching for satisfaction whether it's in marriage, friendship, human nature. The characters, though similar in many ways, also have distinct qualities especially in the way they cope with their problems and the people surrounding them.Of course, needless to say, Keener fits all roles to the T, turning in some of her best works. Anne Heche definitely holds her own. Liev Schreiber is adequate. Kevin Corrigan is great. Todd Field does a fine job too.On the technical side, it's nothing too flashy. Everything flows smoothly. The score gives it the right level of whimsical touch. The locations are beautiful yet simple.In the end, 'Walking and Talking' is a universal human story about friendship.

It's the sort of film that some will think is the cat's meow while others will despise it like it's a child molester and both points of view will be valid. That's because while this movie is well done, what it does is so blisteringly ordinary. Just about anyone who watches it will have moments of emotional recognition for what's going on in the story and most will spend the time in between those moments plaintively waiting for the talking and walking to go anywhere.Amelia (Catherine Keener) is a single woman in New York City. She has a lifelong best friend named Laura (Anne Heche) who's now living with a boyfriend (Todd Field). Amelia doesn't have a boyfriend. She does have an ex-boyfriend named Andrew (Liev Schrieber) who hangs around like Cosmo Kramer from Seinfeld. Amelia's also got a cat dying of cancer and a video store clerk/horror movie fan (Kevin Corrigan) who wants to bone her.As soon as Laura's boyfriend proposes to her, she starts fancying other men. As soon as Amelia gets comfortable with settling for the video store clerk, he dumps her for saying he's ugly behind his back. Andrew has a father with Alzheimer's and a pseudo-girlfriend in California whom he wants to dump right after he has phone sex with her. Amelia feels abandoned by Laura not always being there for her and Laura can't always be there for her because she's actually gone out and gotten a life of her own.Now take all of that and coat it with 2 ½ inches of well written but mostly inconsequential blather and you've got Walking And Talking. It'll work for you if you like the performers, enjoy having a waterfall of very short scenes splash over you and appreciate examinations of humanity in utterly unexceptional circumstances. It'll feel like a potato peeler across your forehead if you want characters that are likable, need a story to have some propulsion and don't want to watch a motion picture that's less interesting than your own life.Catherine Keener does a wonderful job playing a woman you really wouldn't want to know. Anne Hech is as good playing a woman you would want to know but would have a love/hate relationship with. Liev Schreiber is okay, except for the fact that Amelia and Andrew's relationship is written as though Nicole Holofcener has never met a man, let alone dated one. Ex-lovers can certainly break up and still find a way to be friends. That way is not going to be like it is here, where Amelia treats Andrew like her gay best friend and Andrew behaves like he's her gay best friend. That's an odd way for ex-lovers to relate and requires a lot more explanation than it gets in Walking And Talking.Which is a complaint that could be levied against much of this script. While the film is already too long as 86 minutes, the story feels like significant parts of it are regularly being skipped in order to show you scenes that would normally be cut out of a film to tighten it up. None of it's bad, but you can't help thinking there's something more important you should be seeing.If you like dramas where the drama is muted, comedies where the comedy produces more knowing grins than giggles and romances where you don't particularly care if the lovers get together or not, give Walking And Talking a try. If you can take pleasure from craft for its own sake, give Walking And Talking a try. If you want a movie that doesn't remind you of the inane conversations you've had with your own friends, find something else to watch "},{"Title":"Nicole Holocenfer's first....is best","Date":"15 June 2010","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Even in her first film back in 1996, Nicole Holocenfer has always been the best at conveying so much feeling, with so little.'Walking and Talking' is an impressive Nicole Holocenfer starter and possibly her best as it gets everything just right in that Nicole Holofcener way. It doesn't over due with the bonding motives drenched in the appropriate music that Nicole Holocenfer can't see the cheese in and has induced in her more recent films immensely. This first effort also spawns Nicole's signature comedy of finding the hilarity in smug, annoying and odd strangers(who we all loathe), and in the funny but horrible shallowness of her characters in which has made Nicole known for making comedic movies since then. The writing here is more raw and youthful with Nicole's feelings as a girl and a woman, maybe because of the times but this makes for more original, interesting, and entertaining dialogue and performances.'Walking and Talking' unlike Nicole's later films, also doesn't hit you over the head with the acts of one dimensional characters as each character properly goes through a vary of feelings and moods as they each go through various different situations of life, more so like real people. With this, (unfortuantely unlike her other films) she doesn't make the men in the movie side notes and props. They get a say too and convey almost as much emotion as the female characters. Nicole Holofcener's point in her movies maybe to make women the forefront of her movies and to make men the props, but I personally find it insulting and typical to do this, so it was perfect to see her first effort was true to everyone.Nicole's direction style, especially with this entire, tells us shes not afraid to make things wacky to convey a character's thoughts and emotions even in a story of real-life, and with her camera direction as well, she always makes things feel interesting to watch as characters appear on the screen and as scenes coming along with a simple pan, although things going on in the movie are average life situations. And she never pushes a scene into a more sexually or exciting realm for interest of the viewer, as she keeps scenes in the reality of what it is depicting, which is wonderful because its real. She proves to be a big fan of the fade in and fade out into and out of sequences as its used here and in her later films, but it makes more sense in 'Walking and Talking'and brings certain meaning to certain scenes as appose to 'Friends with Money' but the fade out was interesting in that movie none-the-less. This direction style with the soft, awkward acoustic music to the scenes can be also seen as influential to the indie movie scene of 2000s with it's structure, to movies like 'Juno'.This is a great 90's time capsule and even unrated as a definitive 90's movie with it's great 90's soundtrack and band references, it's geek-tom fan fair, and laid-back lifestyles of the characters so significant to generation x.This first effort years ago, shows that Nicole Holofcener gets like no other the awkwardness of relating to ageing family members and ageing in general. The feeling of being lonely, and feeling that time is passing by and being wasted having your own ironic stupid superficial ideals hold you back from being with someone who wants to fill the void and who thinks your the bell-of-the-ball, and that you don't know someone can make you happy until you give them a shot, because you can't wait forever. This is also one of the most accurate films showing the jealously shared between to friends, of one having someone in companionship, and the other having no one in freedom. This is an important,intelligent and accurate film for females but at it's core its also a life study for men and women equally.May I also add, that no wonder Nicole Holofcener has used Catherine Keener all these years.... Shes a great actress. And This is proof that Kevin Corrigan has always been amazing.

But then, things start slid to fast from under her feet, her cat gets cancer, her best friend, Laura, is getting married, and Bill(her ugly date), hasn't talked to her in two weeks.. All this time, she keeps up the appearance, while helping Laura pick out a place for the wedding, giving Andrew advice about his relationship with a girl in California, treating her cats cancer, and trying to win over Bill. this is one of those films that everyone (apart from small children) can have something in common. whether they have commitment issues, as Laura has with Frank , or you still like your ex, like Andrew does Amelia, or you feel like the third wheel, just like Amelia does with Laura, or you feel very distant from your partner, as Frank does with Laura. we all connect one of these characters to ourselves or someone we know. Everyone feels like Frank sometimes, walking on eggshells, not having any say in anything anymore. Everyone feels like Laura sometimes, like everything is going to fast, and you want to go back and enjoy life as it was before. Everyone feels like Andrew sometimes, we get so close to getting back with an ex, and being rejected nicely. And Everyone feels like Amelia sometimes, when nothing is going is your way, and nobody is listening.

Sometimes you get a Being John Malkovitch, where it all pays off. More often than not, those end up like the films by pedantic pissant Harmony Korine (you couldn't pay me enough money to watch Gummo again). On the other end of the spectrum, though, are filmmakers who just try to make movies about people. These are simple movies without fancy handheld camera tricks, Vaseline coated filters, or the use of unattractive actors simply to prove that the world is ugly (One more time, Harmony Korine, I'm talking to you). They use actors who look like people, perhaps a little more attractive, but not much. And these people speak the way your friends talk, not the way a bunch of film school graduate students talk. Nicole Holofcener's Walking and Talking is a perfect example of the latter kind of film. Frankly, it doesn't aim very high, but then again it never feels forced, obnoxious, or pretentious (Last stab at you, Harmony Korine).Walking and Talking is frankly about just that, the movement of life and the conversations we have along with way, conversations with people we love, people we hate, and people we want to love. It has a wonderful awareness that sometimes good intentions go bad, that sometimes jokes hurt, and that sometimes dull doesn't mean bad.Amelia (Catherine Keener) and Laura (Anne Heche) are like sisters. Former roommates, they've always told each other everything, but now Laura is engaged Frank (Todd Field) and sometimes Laura, who works as an obviously pretty awful therapist, tells Frank secrets first. Amelia, on the other hand, is looking for love. She's proud that she can now be friends with her ex-boyfriend Andrew (Liev Schreiber) and that she can find attractiveness in the ugly video store clerk Bill (Kevin Corrigan). None of these characters are 100% successful at anything they do and they all seem to be living with illusions that there's something better out there for them. But rather than going looking for it, they rent videos, shop, and talk of the phone. And yet, as Holofcener makes clear, there's nothing unusual, tragic, or pathetic about this lifestyle.Holofcener's greatest skill is that she doesn't judge any of these characters and she does a wonderful job with the actors making their performances seem real. Unlike so many movie characters, you don't leave Walking and Talking wishing you had friends that were this cool. You leave realizing that your friends are very similar. Holofcener doesn't force any of the action, displaying no particular personal directing style in both the best and worse senses of the phrase. She doesn't do much to move the story along, but she also never distracts you.Since this movie came out we've gotten to know all of the actors better. Anne Heche became something of a media generated star. Catherine Keener was nominated for an Oscar. Todd Field featured prominently in Eyes Wide Shut, Liev Schreiber was in Screams 2 and 3, and Kevin Corrigan has been in 22 TV and movie projects in those 4 years. Several of these actors have resorted to schtick in other films (mostly Heche and Corrigan here), but in Walking and Talking they all seem casual and correct. It's a pleasure to watch them.Walking and Talking is very slight, but it's also memorable for the performances, the unforced writing, and a nice depiction of New York City that doesn't seem overly familiar. This is a solid 7/10, a good rental that loses nothing on the small screen.

Catherine Keener is one of the best actresses around, and she's particularly good at comic roles. The relationship betw. her and Heche in this movie is really touching and authentic. Few movies focus on women's friendships w/ one another, and even fewer achieve this level of realism and complexity. Kevin Corrigan is deadpan hilarious as Keener's ... I guess you could call him a love interest, but that's not quite it. This is a very funny and yet a very sweet movie. --Frink-3 "},{"Title":"Funny story with real characters.","Date":"8 May 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  An excellent film featuring a slightly manic and wonderful performance by Anne Heche, leading a stellar indie cast.

I just watched it again at 35, and love it just as much now as I did then (I am ordering the DVD on Amazon). One of the best movies about relationships period, whether it be in set in the 90's, this decade or beyond. It is never cliché, never dated, and features a dream cast with chemistry to boot. It is funny, moving, and absolutely believable. The performances by Heche, Keener and Schreiber are top-notch, and it was good to see Randall Batinkoff in a small role as a struggling actor/waiter. A short and sweet gem of a movie, a definite must-see. "},{"Title":"See it for the great actors (esp. Corrigan & Heche)","Date":"30 November 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  I do believe that Anne Heche is a severely underrated actor.  She stands out in every movie that I've seen her in, including this one.  She switches from sympathetic and lovable to borderline nuts very quickly, and then switches back again.  No matter what one knows about her wacky private life, she really knows how to turn into a believable and sympathetic character on screen.  In fact, all the actors in this piece are quite good.  Another standout is Kevin Corrigan, as the geeky clerk at a video store.  The movie has good dialog, but the plot is sentimental, ending with a presumably happy wedding. It's essentially about the love between two female friends, and how it is affected when one of the friends becomes engaged.  The one who is engaged (Anne Heche) becomes wrapped up in herself, and engages in behavior likely to end the engagement and the friendship.  The friend (Catherine Keener) dates an inappropriate man (Kevin Corrigan) after breaking up with a man (Liev Schrieber) for an unidentifiable reason.  The fiance, Todd Field, is stolid and lovable throughout, although a bit off-center, which is why Anne Heche has her doubts.See it for the actors--they were good in 1996 and they're good now.

Especially if you're not trying to come across as a Guy that's not emotional. If you are, don't worry. The movie runs less than 2 hours and you can sit back and eat popcorn while your date is busy watching the mid life crisis of dating that the movie showcases. All kidding aside, this is a nice little movie. The film is pretty much a talkie in the sense that the movie consists of people talking and talking and talking, and sometime walking and talking. A film about relationships and dealing with past and present lovers by talking it over, Walking and Talking has a perfect cast of characters that keeps your interested in what's happening throughout the movie. The simple direction by the film maker only adds to the dialog of the movie, which makes up about 95% of the movie!

"},{"Title":"Moderately Involving Character Study","Date":"1 May 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  	How new relationships and the inevitable changes that occur with the passing of years affects two lifelong friends is considered in `Walking and Talking,' directed by Nicole Holofcener.  Amelia (Catherine Keener), has achieved a track record of disastrous relationships with the men in her life, and currently she is unattached and in therapy.  Laura (Anne Heche), on the other hand, is about to become a practicing therapist, but more importantly, she has a successful, long standing relationship with Frank (Todd Field), a jewelry designer who has just, in fact, asked her to marry him.  Laura is concerned about how Amelia will react to their engagement, especially in light of the fact that the only guy who seems to be interested in her is Bill (Kevin Corrigan), a video store clerk who Amelia simply refers to as `The ugly video store guy.'  Confusing matters somewhat, as well, is the friendship Amelia insists on maintaining with Andrew (Liev Schreiber), an ex-boyfriend with whom she had an obsessive relationship.  And so it is that Amelia and Laura find themselves at a crossroads; regarding not only the direction of their individual lives, but the future of their relationship with one another.  	Working from her own screenplay, Holofcener shows some insight into human nature and the course one's life is often compelled to take.  It's a fairly perceptive examination of emotional vulnerability, as expressed through the character of Amelia, as well as of the strength of resolution we find in Laura.  It's a thoughtful presentation, focused through the interrelationship of the two women and the three men in their lives, which develops a profile that pretty much covers the entire emotional spectrum.  And Holofcener does it realistically and effectively, avoiding stereotypes while making her characters believable, if not necessarily sympathetic.	Keener is the most engaging of the bunch, affecting a naturalness while painting a vivid portrait of an emotionally challenged, somewhat confused and directionless young woman perpetually mired in an emotional wasteland; all of which Keener conveys extremely well.  And Heche does an excellent job with her portrayal of Laura, who is somewhat self-absorbed, and who has obviously developed on an emotional level quite different from Amelia.  She comes across as rather cold at times, which keeps her at arm's length from the audience, but it allows the viewer to make an even stronger connection with Amelia, whose situation is one with which many will be able to identify.  	Field makes a good impression here, making Frank more than the typical male caricature to which a part like this often succumbs, and Schreiber gives a good performance as well, as something of the masculine counterpart of Amelia, though a bit more on track with his life.	Kevin Corrigan makes Bill the one with whom you can most readily empathize, however, as he captures the emotional complexities of his character with an extremely subtle, understated performance.  And it's through Bill that we gain valuable insight into the true nature of the other characters.  It's a supporting, but pivotal role, sensitively and effectively rendered by Corrigan, who is a terrific character actor, and a definite asset to this particular film.  	The supporting cast includes Randall Batinkoff (Peter), Joseph Siravo (Amelia's therapist) and Vinny Pastore (Laura's Devil-Seeing Patient).  It covers rather familiar territory, but Holofcener does it quite well, and makes `Walking and Talking' an entertaining, if only moderately involving film.  She has a nice touch, and though it may not be anything ground breaking, with the presence of Keener and Corrigan, especially, it certainly makes this endeavor worth a look.  I rate this one 6/10.       	     "}]
