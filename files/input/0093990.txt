Made in 1987 it surely looks like it was made earlier. It even looked like a drive-in flick. The acting was okay, no big names here. Joe B. Barton (Buddy) was also seen in Blood Diner made in the same year. Don Barret (Lester) was seen in two more flicks. maybe the one who made it was Sherry Leigh who did stunts for a lot of B-flicks. The story is very simple, an abandoned slaughterhouse is the ideal place to party for some youngsters but naturally it turns out awry. Not only that, the place is for sale but the owners don't want to sell it and are out for some revenge. The killings aren't gory but they do have some red stuff. But it's low on killings, only in the beginning and the end, in between it's blah blah. Easy to see it was low budget. Just have a look at the end, it stops with a freeze, up to you to guess what is going to happen. Some say it's a slasher, for me it isn't. It was clearly made out of that era and nothing is added to name it a slasher, no points of view or whatsoever.

The killers pig squeals are funny rather than frightening. The mixing of comedy and horror can be tricky to pull off, but it just about stayed black enough to work here. The opening shots of pigs being slaughtered were darkly humorous and I particularly liked the excessive ketchup on chips scene.I liked all of the characters and even wanted to see more of their teenage tomfoolery. In critique it does all feel rather lightweight with not much content. Settings such as the dance aren't exploited as they could have been. In particular more could have been made of the deaths, especially those towards the end. Whilst some of them were surprisingly nasty, they were all fleeting and could have been extended to add to the black humour. There weren't really any scares to be had, despite some enjoyably atmospheric eerie music.I would also have liked to have seen an added chase scene and a bit more thrust towards the climax. I did enjoy the freeze frame ending but it could have done with a bit more energy immediately before getting there, as it was slightly anticlimactic. Overall Slaughterhouse offers a slight, but fun time for 1980's slasher aficionados.

But when his daughter & her friends enter the slaughterhouse on a dare one stormy night, the stage is set for a grand scale massacre of, blood flowing, arm hacking, head crushing, ground up bodied, bonanza. SLAUGHTERHOUSE is a very rare horror film, that is pretty tough to find these days. Released by NEW WORLD VIDEO back in 1987, SLAUGHTERHOUSE was always a favourite of mine when I was a kid, it was pretty scary. I saw it a few times more over the years, but after 1997, I never did lay eyes on another copy again until just recently, when I stumbled upon an old VHS copy & let me just say, SLAUGHTERHOUSE is just as much fun to watch today, as it was back then. The acting is not to bad & is a cut above most horror film performances in other 80's horror items. I recognized a few familiar faces amongst the teen cast JANE HIGGENSON (SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT 5 THE TOYMAKER) & the lead actress also starred in another favourite horror film of mine, the weird & scary, DEMON WIND. The direction as also pretty decent, with director RICK ROSSELER delivering plenty of good gory scenes in his script, tight pacing & a decent amount of suspense. SLAUGHTERHOUSE is pretty fun, but just like most directors who helmed a good or bad horror item back in the 1980's, he seemed to disappear from the scene & it's such a shame. After this film, he only had one other movie to his credit, where he served as a production assistant in 1992. I definitely think Rosseler could have made a name for himself in the indie horror scene had he done more & I definitely would have tried to follow his work within the genre. The film also pays tribute to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) with the slaughterhouse adorned with animal bones, skins & rotting animal carcases lying about. Sadly long forgotten in the horror community, SLAUGHTERHOUSE deserves a fairly decent DVD release full of extra's. It's head above most remembered horror films of that era & it's even more of a shame that we didn't get to see the further adventures of the villain Buddy in further sequels. As a franchise, SLAUGHTERHOUSE would have rocked.

Clearly this was the intention of writer/director Rick Roessler from the opening sequence, but it seriously devalues any threats of suspense and tension that might be brewing and leaves an unsatisfying taste in the mouth. Buddy's Pop is cartoonish in tone too but Don Barrett makes a fair old go of it in the eye rolling/teeth gnashing department, so some kudos is due there.The last third however, does make up for these shortcomings somewhat with an atmospheric climax in the meat plant chamber of horrors where most of the cast are quite harshly dispatched in brutal fashion before the freeze frame cliff-hanger brings us to an unexpected full stop.Keeping the murderous pig farmers in the shadows would have added a much needed air of mystery and surprise and may have pushed it toward the realm of 'minor classic' and, possibly, a higher rating.

It may be due to the macabre atmosphere that meat packing plants are stereotyped as, or possibly that I have worked in the meat industry before. But whatever its potential, it makes for an ideal place for morbid acts to follow where no one may hear you scream within the pale, blood-stained walls.And such a setting couldn't work any better than a film that sums it up in its title Slaughterhouse. With comic relief and parodies sprinkled throughout, Slaughterhouse (1987) pursues a group of a half-dozen teens looking to have a good time on their upcoming holiday weekend (as almost every horror film from the 80s outlines), and decide to shoot their own horror movie at an old rundown slaughterhouse. But contrary to their knowledge, they will be at the wrong place at the wrong time and greeted, with a not-so-warm welcome, by an obese, cleaver-wielding, pig- snorting Buddy Bacon (Joe Barton).The film also follows three other individuals who are looking to possess and reincarnate the dilapidated slaughterhouse into a modern, mechanized meat packing plant. But that's not going to be so easy as the current landowner, Lester Bacon (Don Barrett), is against the contemporary method of meat processing and abides by his classic craftsmanship and sharp knives approach.In an effort to prevent his condemned slaughterhouse from making the switch, Lester and his son Buddy spare the hogs and decide to get their choice-cut chops from anyone who crosses into their boundaries. Looks like the old Bacon & Son slaughterhouse is up and running again, but this time hanging and aging a more prime selection.Right from the film's intro, director Rick Roessler sets the tone with the initial execution as a cleaver to the face that looks like a homage to the infamous axe to the face in the original Friday The 13th (or going back even further to Friday's admiration from Mario Bava's Bay of Blood), but of course with effects to a lesser extent. The film also features other slaughterhouse-esque kills, including one thrown into the grinder becoming crushed within the auger (which is probably the most grotesque), head crushing, several meat-hook hangings, but mainly it's Buddy having a good time swinging away his oversized cleaver. Above all, we must remember that this was produced in the 80s and, of course, it has its fair share of cheesy dialogue, cornstarch with red dye blood effects, and a Casio keyboard musical score (although I did find the brass music in the opening credits quite catchy). Having that said, Slaughterhouse still is able to present its audience with decent suspense building, a plot base, comic relief throughout its entirety, and some pretty effective slash scenes for its time (remember&#x85;80s). It's a film to have fun with and to enjoy the retrospect of a decade that released a different generation of horror that we look back on and love, in which we will sadly no longer see again in our new day and age.

There's a fair amount of gore, although the body count may not be high enough to suit some tastes. Writer / director Rick Roessler gives us a taste of what's to come with his pre-credit sequence, then goes through a little bit of set-up, eventually delivering respectable bloody mayhem for 80s horror lovers.Don Barrett plays Lester Bacon, a demented old farmer about to lose his slaughterhouse to foreclosure. He lives with a massive, mentally impaired son named Buddy (Joe B. Barton), who grunts instead of talks, and who is very handy with assorted killing implements. Buddy also gets along much better with pigs than with people. Lester finds that Buddy has a taste for murder, but implores him to save it for those who deserve it, namely those that are trying to take his business away from him. Soon enough, he starts to enjoy the experience.Barrett is a delight, and Barton is quite fun to watch, especially in one scene where Buddy goes on a joyride after slaughtering a deputy. The movie gets better as it goes along, culminating in what is actually a solid finale, as four friends that had been filming their own horror footage head right into danger by utilizing the slaughterhouse at night.

Quite a cult item, which obviously takes influence from Tobe Hooper's genre setter 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', with its eccentrically dark humorous streak making it so endearingly warped like that found in 'Motel Hell' and Hooper's sequel 'The Texas chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986)'. What a nice combination. Now what really works in its favour, is there's an actual plot hanging off the meat hook than just focusing on a bunch of rowdy teens (which this film does have) being pointlessly slaughtered (and it does happen). Hell the format isn't anything original, but manages to feel slightly fresh with it rancid slasher conventions and keeps things moving with always something amusing happening. What is a little disappointing though, with a title like that is the lack of gore, as the most sickening (or yummy) scene can be found in the opening shots (take a lesson in the trade) of pigs going through the gruelling slaughterhouse procedures. Nice fresh cuts. I found the whole experience more so goofy than anything else. Buddy (the obese, snorting and meat-clever donning killer) seems to be played for laughs. He sure knows how to cut someone up, and leave a mark. The script has its basic quips, but it sure loved to use pigs as it main talking point. It can get pun-overload. Death scenes are well done, with one or two creative efforts. The final set-up you see coming, but how it actually finishes only shocks with a depressingly ominous, but sudden conclusion. Director Rick Roessler (his one and only film) does a modest job, elevating some suspense, sticking in with energy, creating few moments of atmosphere and well-placed jarring sound effects. He knows how to keep it busy (or is it the quick-laced editing), as there's something to gain your interest. Standard humour to grisly violence and an odd reference here or there. Having two eccentrically odd killers couldn't do it any harm either. Don Barrett was a treat as the old coot Les Bacon and Joe Barton dominates as his fat, mentally challenged son Buddy who expresses himself through pig noises. Like you do. The rest of the cast are acceptable with a solid Sherry Leigh and William Houck. Jeff Wright and Donna Stevens have enjoyable roles too. Oh and I almost forgot. What's the deal with the majority of 80s horror films plugging some crappy band ('Vantage Point' get there foot in) and the soundtrack is a whole lot of noise. Random and at times strange cues.

I don't know","Date":"4 July 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Horror","Review":" I don't know whether to love or to hate this movie because, despite it being a obvious ripoff or omen to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre it wasn't all that bad. The one thing that it was missing tho was, female full frontal nudity, if there was some of that if the movie I would have rated it higher. The killer in this movie is a mentally challenged boy witch doesn't have anywhere close the the horror appear that Leatherface does and while running around he constantly makes pig noises which I thought was just stupid and didn't add to the scare factor of the movie. But it quite funny seeing how similar it is to the chainsaw movie. If you like horror movies you MIGHT like this.

Teenagers, police, and other unfortunate folks are being stalked by a father and son who live on the land of a decrepit, abandoned abattoir, pressed into bankruptcy due to an evolved mechanized processing system which prospers more within the county.The star of the film is Buddy(Joe B Barton), a massive, unclean, mentally challenged son, in overalls, of demented slaughterhouse father Lester Bacon(Don Barrett) who kills people that threaten his pops or pigs. He's very primitive in nature, and the film establishes his kinship with the porcine population..he even grunts like a pig instead of talk! The problem with Buddy is that he comes off so cartoonish, the character doesn't have the menace required. Lester is told by his lawyer and an arch rival hog slaughter businessman that he's being foreclosed if he doesn't except a substantial fee offered for his land, not longer used to process hog meat. So Lester takes his vendetta one step further by having his boy dispose of them in gruesome ways(..one is lifted off his feet, his face crushed, another is forced into a meat grinder). A group of teenagers are shooting an amateur horror movie, using the abandoned slaughterhouse as a setting which is how they come in contact with Buddy, sealing their fates. The final girl is Lizzie Borden(Sherry Leigh), not joking, and her father is the county sheriff(William Houck).Generic characters(..the cast do their best but have little to work with)and plot, relatively little profanity and features no nudity. The gore is at a minimum with director Rick Roessler having to find economic ways to make kill-scenes more cringe-worthy(..even without the graphic nature to back them up) due to lack of budget. Let's face it, not every low budget filmmaker had the fortune of acquiring Tom Savini's talents so they had to do the best they could with the finances available. Rick Roessler uses blood and certain camera angles to emphasize blunt force trauma to victim's faces/heads without the effectiveness of grisly carnage. Buddy's weapon-of-choice is a bone crusher cleaver with a long handle and he swings it wildly at horrified victims who get caught on the premises of his paw's slaughterhouse factory. Some characters have trouble getting their key in the ignition to start up their cars, with one female victim actually vacating her vehicle! Besides his cleaver, Buddy uses other hog slaughtering equipment to kill his victims. One positive is that the rural setting firmly plants SLAUGHTERHOUSE in the hillbilly horror category and is a nice change-of-pace from the usual squalor of city life(..or small town suburbia), but Rick Roessler isn't quite able to succeed in tapping into the terror such a location can often elicit. I felt the light-hearted and goofy tone, along with the kooky music had something to do with that.

Maybe some friends of mine were just a tiny bit too enthusiastic about it. I was hoping for something a bit more foul with a bit more tension. Instead, I got a movie were certain scenes bordered on comedy, if not, slapstick even (the one were LesterPigboyBacon started driving the police car). It could have been a more malevolent film and indeed, the killer was too clownish, and basically too stupid to come across as menacing. Plus, to satisfy the revenge-plot, only three characters had to be killed, and even that took ages for it to happen. Instead they threw in the pretty irrelevant subplot with the teenagers who want to shoot a horror-video at the isolated farmhouse, just to pad things out & up the body count (and most likely to try and give this film that popular 80's slasher vibe, to please a certain target audience). On the upside, I've seen 80's horror productions with the same budgetary restrictions turn to utter crap. At least that didn't happen with SLAUGHTERHOUSE. A fair enough film, for its low budget, thankfully with a few enjoyable kills in it. And a typical, clichéd frozen frame shock ending. That always rocks my boat.

If you like 80's slashers, you'll like this one. If it's not your thing, skip it One thing this film is sadly missing is female nudity. A slasher film with no nudity is like a Leonardo Dicaprio film with no gay fan base, unnatural somehow. Plus the ending is too abrupt.

In fact, it's one of the worst films I've seen recently and this is after watching SILO KILLER and SCARECROWS. SLAUGHTERHOUSE is as bad as SCARECROWS. Everything about it is truly pathetic. Being a big TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE fan, I had hopes that this film would be a fun rip-off. It's not. It tries to be funny and scary and it's not even close to being funny (in a good way or bad way) and it's definitely not scary. The only thing scary about this woeful film is the acting. I've never seen such bad acting put on film! The acting in an Ed Wood movie is usually better than the acting in this dreck. There's a scene inside the slaughterhouse, when the fat killer is above one of the businessmen and taunts the businessman with a weapon. That scene is the most pathetic example of acting I've ever seen in a film. I regretted watching this horrible film. It's bad and to be avoided at all cost.
