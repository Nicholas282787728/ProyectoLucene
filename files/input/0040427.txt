Literally. It is an accurate account of the 1947 manhunt for the most cunning criminal in the history of the Los Angeles Police Department. He Walked By Night is a turning point in the detective movie, displaying the real-life police procedures used in searching for a criminal, which include teamwork and technology, and showing far more realistic characters than other flicks did. Other movies of this era showed phony, daring detectives engaging in shoot-em-ups with criminals while wooing a woman. He Walked By Night captures reality in a stark and startling way, with excellent black-and-white photography from John Alton. Though Scott Brady was probably too young (24) as the lead detective in this movie, his realistic performance is a welcomed relief from the over-the-top camp performances from actors in other detective movies, such as Dick Powell's in Murder My Sweet and Alan Ladd's in every one of his detective movies.The realistic technique of this movie was so innovative, that Jack Webb (who has his first good-sized role in this movie) used this technique in making his 1940s radio show Dragnet. When he brought Dragnet to television in 1951, the style of the show influenced countless other shows, launching realistic police drama in television. This realistic style is very noticeable in TV shows today, such as Law and Order, and NYPD Blue.As influential as He Walked By Night was, it is also a finely acted, finely directed, well-written, and intense police movie. It is being re-released on DVD under The Great Cops Movies, so don't miss it.

Apparently the real-life Roy was named Erwin Walker -- aka Machine Gun Walker. Honest. Walker was indeed a World War II vet, a former Glendale PD radio dispatcher, and a brilliant student at Cal Tech. The true story is even better than the film Walker wasn't killed by police, and managed to evade the death penalty with a plea of insanity.

It has a semi-documentary look combined with many of the conventions of film noir (thanks partly to cinematographer John Alton). Many of the outside scenes were filmed in or around actual locations. Richard Basehart plays a loner who is well-versed in electronic technology, guns, and police procedures. He's able to stay one step ahead of the cops because his paranoia and attention to detail keep him in a constant state of alert. It's also helpful that he listens in with his police-band radio. For a time he confounds the Hollywood cops because he changes his modus operandi. He begins as a break-in artist who steals electronic equipment, but when he kills a suspicious young policeman and loses some of his tools, he turns to armed robbery of liquor stores. Nobody can find him because he travels through Los Angeles in its underground storm drains, where he has hidden stashes of guns and other survival equipment.    We also follow the cops as they make use of whatever little information they're able to gather on Basehart's character, and slowly they do close in after several missed opportunities and track the killer into the storm drains, where the play of light and shadow really takes over.    One of the cops in He Walked By Night is played by Jack Webb, and there's no question he got the inspiration for 'Dragnet from this film. For starters, He Walked By Night begins with a sky pan of Los Angeles and scenes of everyday Hollywood while the narrator gives a kind of this is the city speech. The police scenes are often very quotidian (sometimes to the point of being overly detailed), with cops tossing in small talk like how's the missus? glad to hear it before they ask other questions. Much of the pacing, attitude and overall feel of Dragnet, which began as a radio show a year after this film and then moved to TV in 1952, is already here.    The final scene in Los Angeles' storm drains (seven hundred miles of hidden highways, according to the narrator) provides probably this film's most memorable images. Its set-up and execution are remarkably similar to Orson Wells being chased through the sewers of Vienna in Carol Reed's The Third Man, which was filmed a year later and likely inspired by He Walked By Night. And who knows, it might also have given a few ideas to the makers of Them a couple of years later when they revisited the L.A. storm drains with their giant ants.    Ultimately, Basehart's character remains an enigma. We never learn that much about him. He Walked By Night isn't a great film, but it's an enjoyable look at postwar police work and primitive forensics.

Aside from the marvelous Satan BUG (1965), this film is probably Basehart's best--and as far as HIS acting goes, his best. He is one of the most cold-hearted and scary villains I have ever seen. This is because he is NOT larger than life or obviously menacing. Instead, he looks like any other guy and can appear nice and harmless--only to steal or butcher without remorse. At the same time, the film is NOT overly explicit or gratuitous--it's just a wonderful portrait of a brilliant sociopath at work.

To his amazement, the man surprises him pulling a gun and shoots him. The incident marks the beginning of a dragnet in which all police resources will concentrate in apprehending the criminal that killed one of their peers.Roy Martin, as he calls himself, is a young man with an unusual ability for everything electric. He likes to put things together, then tries to interest Paul Reeves, a businessman with an important clientele to lease the things Martin brings him. All goes well until the time he makes a tactical mistake. He leaves an equipment for television that turns out to have been stolen from the same man that Reeves has called to peddle the item.What the LAPD doesn't know is that Roy Martin has a way for evading the enemy. He has discovered the system under the Los Angeles streets for the heavy flash floods it experiences to make his getaway. He is a slippery man with superior intelligence to outsmart the police. Ultimately, the police gets a break that will put an end to Roy's crime spree.Albert Werker directed the impressive He Walked by Night, a 1948 film noir that went to be imitated by a lot of people in Hollywood. It also became the model of the television show Dragnet that came later, in which Jack Webb, who is prominently featured, explored some of the principles originated in the breakthrough film. Anthony Mann was also on board to help with the direction, and it shows, although he is not given credit for the work he did. Crane Wilbur and John Higgins wrote the screenplay in a semi-documentary style. It is a tribute to all the creators the film has survived long after it was first released. The best thing in the film is John Alton's black and white cinematography that captures the Los Angeles of that era in all its splendor.Richard Basehart made a cool Roy Martin. This was Mr. Basehart's third picture and he showed a great potential as the criminal that was able to outsmart the police. The supporting players, Scott Brady, Whit Bissell, James Cardwell, and Roy Roberts, among them, do a good job under Mr. Werker's direction.

Principally because of the diabolical cleverness, intelligence and cunning of a completely unknown killer.....The record is set down here factually-as it happened. Only the names have been changed to protect the innocent.Cracking little noir picture this one. Richard Baseheart is Davis Morgan, a cold and calculated thief and murderer. He is not only unknown to the police, but also to the Los Angeles underworld. Something which made him a terrifying ghost on the streets. Based on the real life case of cop-killer come thief Erwin Walker, who in 1946 struck terror into the heart of LA, He Walked By Night zips along at a frenetic pace but maintains all the darkness requisites of the Film Noir genre. Directed by Alfred Walker (aided by one uncredited Anthony Mann) and also starring Jack Webb (who used the piece as inspiration for the popular Dragnet TV series), the picture has excellent use of shadows and a brilliant finale down in the Los Angeles drainage system. Where the sound of guns and running feet is just ferocious. Baseheart is suitably chilling as a man coming unhinged by the day, whilst a home surgery sequence shows Baseheart to have had no small amount of ability. It's notable with Morgan's character that it's people he just doesn't like, there's a very telling scene with his dog that is sweet but at the same time saying so much about the man himself. This film reminded me very much of Edward Dmytryk's similarly fine 1952 film, The Sniper. So much so I'd say that as a double bill they be perfect for each other. With added plot worth in the form of early police forensics (check out the photo fit technique) and a largely unknown support cast adding a raw reality to proceedings, He Walked By Night comes highly recommended to fans of the Noir and Crime genres. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Technical Adviser Marty Wynn and Miscellaneous Observations","Date":"3 June 2009","Score":"6 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Film-Noir, Thriller","Review":" Fascinating and insightful to read the comments posted by Sgt. Wynn's son Charles (see comment #42 by annwynn). Police technical advisers are commonplace nowadays, but Sgt. Wynn's participation was a novel idea in 1948. This straight shooting approach does nothing to diminish the compelling drama told in this story (accurate depiction of the case it's based on or not). This film is among the best of the documentary style dramas of it's time with A-list voice over specialist Reed Hadley providing the narration. The brief travelogue guide and the tour of Los Angeles Police Headquarters in the opening segment little prepare you for the shocking murder of Officer Robert Rawlins. As a retired police officer, I can assure you that no dispatched call creates quite the adrenalin surge than that of an officer involved shooting. Like a Broken Arrow transmission in the military, all cops break off their current assignment to respond, just like in the film. The film doesn't glorify the drudgery of detective work, on the contrary, it shows that only tireless followup will often lead one to their suspect. This film is among those that piqued my interest in becoming an officer. I too commuted to work and back in uniform (to avoid dressing twice everyday) but Officer Rawlins' ambush was always in the back of my mind and I employed tactics accordingly (always address suspects or suspicious persons from outside your vehicle for instance).It is a bygone era when it was cooler to be a cop than a criminal. Modern films glorify acts of mindless violence and copycat crimes are commonplace. He Walked By Night not only shows the gritty side of policing, it rightly shows that the job can not be done without the help of citizen involvement. If only all sketch artists were as handy with their pencils as Jack Webb/Lee is with his slides. There is little doubt that the use of deadly force in the capture of Roy Morgan is justified and there is no glamour or glory in his death. Two bits of humor in the closing sequence are the apparent length of the battle lantern's cords as they stretch the length of the sewer system and speed in which the detectives/officers don their gas masks before the final confrontation. He Walked By Night to me remains the definitive model upon which all other such police dramas are inspired. Alfred Werker's pacing and John Alton's cinematography are flawless. I think this film is a fitting tribute to Sgt. Marty Wynn and all the cops of his era. I recommend it to everyone.

The methods used by the police and the killer couldn't be more different, as the LAPD place a high value on adhering to standard procedures whereas their quarry uses his considerable ingenuity and expert knowledge of electronics to outwit his pursuers. This all makes for a fascinating cat and mouse game which is compelling to watch and becomes increasingly intense as it moves towards its exciting and visually impressive climax.In the early hours of a summer morning, Roy Martin (Richard Basehart) is trying to break into an electronics store when he sees a police patrol car approaching and casually walks away. The police car follows him and when he's asked to produce some identification, Martin pulls out a gun and shoots the police officer at point blank range. Detective Sergeants Marty Brennan (Scott Brady) and Chuck Jones (James Cardwell) are assigned to the case by Police Captain Breen (Roy Roberts) but their initial efforts to identify the killer draw a blank because there are no leads to follow.Martin regularly sells electronic equipment to a dealer called Paul Reeves (Whit Bissell) who becomes suspicious after one of his customers recognises a television projector (which Martin had supplied) as one that had been stolen from him. After Reeves reports the matter to the police, Brennan and Jones wait in the dealer's office with the intention of arresting Martin but his eventual arrival culminates in a shootout which ends with both Martin and Detective Jones having been shot. Jones is seriously injured and Martin goes home and successfully operates on himself to remove the bullet.The LAPD are determined to hunt down Martin but he continues to keep one step ahead of them by regularly changing his appearance and listening in to their radio communications until Detective Jones has a hunch which enables the police to positively confirm the identity of the killer. This piece of knowledge together with information that they subsequently find about Martin's previous employment, soon enables them to continue their manhunt with greater speed and success than had previously been possible.Roy Martin's story is told in typical docu-noir style complete with the obligatory solemn narration (by Reed Hadley) and some acting which, by today's standards, is rather stiff and formal. Richard Basehart, however, is exceptionally good in his role as the psychopathic loner and World War 11 veteran who's cold, calculating and extremely ruthless. He's a particularly interesting character as he's both intelligent and highly skilled in some areas but also paranoid and a man of few words.It's widely acknowledged that Jack Webb (who appears in this movie as a laboratory technician) was inspired by the experience to create his own very popular radio and TV show Dragnet which also emphasised the value of methodical police work.He Walked By Night looks very realistic and is often suspenseful but its most impressive feature is John Alton's incredible cinematography which enhances the look of the whole movie considerably and contributes to the claustrophobic feel of certain passages. His use of low key lighting, deep focus photography and interesting camera angles is inspired, effective and dramatic and at times, bathes the screen in compositions which create a rather disconcerting atmosphere.

Yet although the flight of Basehart's Roy Martin has precedence over Welles' Harry Lime, and both are terrific thrillers, more people are acquainted with THE THIRD MAN than with HE WALKED BY NIGHT. It's probably due to the exotic nature of post-war Vienna, with such touches as the zither music, and the scenes in the ruins (and the classic moment in the Prater's ferris wheel). Also the last flight of Harry Lime has overtones regarding why Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) kills his old friend - is it to save him from the humiliation of a trial? That does not happen in the Basehart film.It's unfair, for HE WALKED BY NIGHT is a tidy and tense little thriller and police procedural. Told like a documentary, it follows Basehart's criminal career wherein he seems always one step ahead of the police. The film begins when he commits a murder in a robbery (he shoots a policeman) and flees leaving a remarkable set of skeleton keys and picks behind him. The Los Angeles police led by Roy Roberts start looking into whatever clues they have and realize they don't have really much. But Roberts has assistance from the crime lab (Jack Webb, in a prescient - pre-DRAGNET role), and detective Scott Brady as well as others looking into every aspect of the case. But despite some minor advances (they can see how clever the criminal is in the lack of fingerprints and traces) they are not getting anywhere. They get an opening when an electronics firm headed by Whit Bissell discovers that the devices that have been leased out for one Roy Martin are actually stolen items. Bissell is forced to work with the police, and a stake-out ends with Basehart shooting another cop (crippling him) and being shot himself). But Basehart (in a somewhat over-the-top sequence) removes the bullet at his home.That's his secret. Basehart plays the perfect loner. Except for his pet dog nobody gets close to this killer. In fact it is the only flaw in the story that nothing about the reason for Basehart's anti-social point of view is ever given. On the other hand, there is no psychiatric gobbledy-gook that we have to swallow to understand the poor man. For he is totally amoral, and vicious, and one can properly dislike him throughout the movie.But he is smart. He is an electronics whiz, and he has two radios on the police frequency to keep track of what they are up to. He also is clever enough to alter the method of his robberies (this before the use of profiling by police) to confuse the cops. Finally he discovers a perfect way to avoid notice by the police he uses the sewers of Los Angeles as a private highway around that wide city.The film shows how Roberts, Brady, Webb, and the other police gradually manage to get a picture of Basehart from the witnesses (one that Bissell recognizes) and then to zero in on his probable background. It is a film showing police procedural for what it really is - the pounding of city streets asking questions and questions and questions. Sometimes a break comes through, but frequently there is more that confuses the issue (when Brady - in disguise as a milkman - goes to spy on Basehart towards the end of the film, he meets a neighbor who says something evil is going on in the neighborhood, but turns out to be insane about a landlady). It is a film noir that works quite well, and should be better known. But it was not written by a great English author like Graham Green, nor was it directed by Sir Carol Reed. The more colorful film using that great climax in the sewers was still to come. Unfairly that was not the end to this irony. The best known film about the city of Los Angeles with a great fight sequence in the sewers is THEM, the science fiction film of seven years later. HE WALKED BY NIGHT deserves better renown, but it is hard to believe it ever will get it.

On its own, the film is said to have served as a virtual template for the DRAGNET TV series (whose creator, Jack Webb, appears here as a police lab technician).Richard Basehart's characterization of the coldly calculating criminal was possibly the most compelling to be depicted on the screen since the time of Fritz Lang's M (1931). His resourcefulness and devious nature clearly foreshadowed the more obviously maniacal villains of much later films, such as Scorpio in DIRTY HARRY (1971; as in that picture, the hero's sidekick eventually ends up in a wheelchair) and even Hannibal Lecter. Incidentally, the episode of the criminal operating on himself when wounded has since become a cliché (this was probably the first such instance in cinema) &#150; but the numerous shootouts were similarly potent.Also influential is the use of storm drains as both a haven and a conveniently invisible means of travel for the killer &#150; the most notable example, of course, being THE THIRD MAN (1949). Terse and suspenseful, the film is given an added sheen by virtue of John Alton's peerless cinematography (evident in the MGM DVD I watched, but not the various Public Domain prints in circulation; see the DVD Beaver comparison for confirmation).

On the surface it is a police procedural.  But there is a chace through the tunnels leading to the LA River that echoes the better-done chase through Vienna's Cloaca Maximus in The Third Man.  The bobbing flashlights, the hand grasping the sewer grating and finding it blocked from outside, they're all here.  (I forget which movie was released first.)  Then too these are the same tunnels that housed the ants in Them.  Jack Webb, a police technician here, got the idea for Dragnet during the shooting.  If Allan Ladd had a weakness for cats in This Gun for Hire, Richard Basehart as the hunted murderer has a dog that he treats lovingly and that, in turn, warns Basehart when trouble is afoot.  Reed Hadley narrated almost every documentary-style movie that appeared in the late 1940s, as he does here.  Richard Basehart and Roy Roberts, like Webb, went on to careers in television. The trouble begins when Basehart is walking alone on a night-time street in Los Angeles.  He stops in front of a radio store but then, seeing a police car approach, walks on.  The police car stops and the officer begins questioning him -- What are you doing here?, and I'll have to see some identification.  Since I have lived in Southern California cities I must point out that Basehart wasn't doing anything criminal -- except that he was WALKING.  In the cities of Southern California, like L.A. and San Diego, it's sometimes possible to stand on the sidewalk of a residential area and look straight down the street to its vanishing point without seeing a soul.  No pedestrians.  No kids playing.  Nothing.  Everyone drives a car; no one walks.  A pedestrian is suspect because he is a pedestrian.  I was stopped by police dozens of times on city sidewalks.  My landlord was taken to the local police station for walking his dog at night. Of course that's neither here nor there, and yet, if walking weren't so deviant an activity, there would have been no questioning of Basehart and no subsequent homicide, not to mention minor tsuris.  The performances are profient.  The script is adequate to its purpose.  The locations are well chosen.  Basehart lives in one of those courts, a dozen or so single-story duplex cottages built around a central garden.  It's the only way to live in L.A.  You are forced to see your neighbors daily, perhaps even forced to greet them.  The city as a whole is so thoroughly dehumanized that other kinds of settlements are as quiet as morgues and just as much fun.  The photography too is outstanding.  After dark the scenes are shot with strategically placed bright lights, night-for-night.  And there must have been some tricky problems in lighting the tunnel sequences, although they were handled successfully, though with nowhere near the panache of The Third Man.  The score is by the numbers and adds little. If there's any problem with the flick it lies in the way the director(s) handled the script.  The script sticks closely to exposition.  One guy does this.  Another guy does that.  Someone says something illuminating.  But it's played rather flatly, in a kind of cinematic monotone.  Nobody has any quirks.  The masculine banter between the cops doesn't ring true.  There is no humor anywhere in the story.  No one shouts, laughs, or even raises his voice.  Everyone seems to speak and act in carefully measured ways, a spoonful at a time.  Even when Basehart is banging Whit Bissel around, slapping his repeatedly, knocking him to the floor, and kicking him -- it's all done as if the actors were keeping one eye on their marks. This isn't a lethal criticism.  The movie isn't entirely lifeless.  It's just that an occasional rant would have rent its smooth texture.  It's still an interesting movie.  I've enjoyed seeing it over several viewings.

When the dealer of electronics devices Paul Reeves (Whit Bissell) is caught selling a stolen projector, the police finds the identity of the criminal, Roy Martin (Richard Basehart), and connects him to other unsolved robberies. Using the witnesses of his heists, they draw their face, but the true identity of the smart and intelligent criminal is not disclosed. The perseverance of Sgt.

Similar to but far superior to The Naked City, released the same year, the presentation is documentary style, including a somewhat hokey narration. Basehart is convincing as the killer.

He's got no friends, no girl, no job, yet he's one of the more fascinating creations in the noir pantheon. Just when you think he's out of tricks, he pulls out a shotgun as the cops close in. He's hidden one deep inside a storm drain for an emergency like this. Now we know what he does with his time-- he's a one-man army against the machinery of modern society.But wait, he's not against the plug-in kind of machinery. Martin's a closet genius at modifying the most sophisticated electronics, an untrained innovator with just that kind of intelligence. Does he do it for money-- it's hard to tell. We do know he's not above presenting someone else's work as his own. However, that demeaning aspect may simply be the script complying with Production Code requirements. Businessman Whit Bissell would like to partner up with the mystery man's skills, offering a research laboratory in return. But when Martin refuses with a knowing smile, we know he's got his own drummer. And, we also know that anyone who gets in the way of that drummer turns the science whiz into a cold-blooded killer.At first I thought it a mistake that the screenplay didn't fill in more of Martin's personal story, something that might get a handle on his extreme behavior. But on second thought, better to leave him a mystery man of rare and unfeeling talents. That way, we're free to speculate on a background instead of having to settle for some half-baked Freudianism circa 1948. The character strikes me as someone who has chosen to live outside normal bounds as a challenge to his ingenuity and resourcefulness, both of which he possesses in spades.And it's that, I think, which makes him an unusual crime figure. Time and again, he uses those qualities to defeat the relentless machinery of law enforcement, shown in its many scientific and professional phases. Basehart the actor manages a number of subtle shadings conveying a depth of character not shown by the impersonal forces of law and order. Not that the screenplay doesn't try to humanize the cops-- that's the point of the convalescent hospital scene and the crime lab joshing. Rather, for the professionals, it's a job. For Martin, however, it's something deeper, more interesting, but not necessarily admirable.The movie itself has an uncredited Anthony Mann written all over it, especially the scenes with Basehart. Director Mann, cameraman John Alton, and scripters Higgins and Essex are responsible, I expect, for pointing away from the rather dull procedures onto the noirish atmosphere of outlaw alienation. Of course, bit player Jack Webb saw how popular such procedures could be for a TV audience and spun them off into one of the 1950's most successful series. But it's the underground man Roy Martin, alone with his mutt dog and inner demons that makes up one of noir's most fascinating crime figures. And on a final note of irony, notice how close Martin comes to a last minute escape were it not for that diabolical god of the noir universe-- the Hand of Fate.

The evocative, film noir photography of the late great John Alton, who also lensed a couple of John Sturges films Mystery Street and The People Against O'Hara as well as Richard Brooks' Elmer Gantry, gives this lean, mean 1949 thriller an edge that neither its budget nor its action could have achieved in tandem. Alton's photography makes He Walked By Night the memorable experience that it remains. Good acting by all involved bolsters the film's credibility, especially a low-key Basehart registering brilliantly as a contemplative homicidal killer with a pet dog. The dog humanizes Basehart's elusive killer. The most overlooked performance is Whit Bissell as the timid electronics factory owner. Other commentators have provided relevant historical background for this atmospheric melodrama and they are worth reading if the historical background appeals to you. The noted film scholar Jeanne Basinger in her exemplary book about director Anthony Mann writers settles the issue of the directorial authorship of He Walked By Night. She points out that Werker received final credit for He Walked By Night, but Mann helmed all the scenes with Richard Basehart. Clearly, He Walked By Night qualifies more as a Mann film than a Werker effort. Critics have never ballyhooed this low-budget, superbly made, minor urban crime thriller, and this lack of critical recognition is really unfortunate. He Walked By Night provides top-drawer suspense entertainment in virtually every department. The only objectionable scene here involves a couple of detectives grilling a Chinese suspect. Not only does the man not know English, but also the detectives look like idiots for questioning someone that clearly doesn't understand English.He Walked by Night unfolds with several long shots of a Los Angeles city map. Racket Squad actor Reed Hadley delivers the prototypical description of L.A. that would open each Dragnet episode over similar shots. Afterward, Mann takes us first to the Hollywood Police Division where we learn that He Walked By Night is the case history of a killer. The scene shifts to a dark, quiet. tree-lined street late one evening in Hollywood. An immaculately dressed Roy Martin (Richard Basehart of Moby Dick) is prowling dark streets and casing an electronics shop. Equipped with lock-picking tools, he is about to commit burglary when an off-duty cop heading home, Office Robert Rawlins (John McGuire of Flamingo Road), spots him. Rawlins pulls over and questions him. When he asks to see some identification, Rawlins isn't prepared for the reception that he receives. Martin produces a gun from his suit and blasts away. Swiftly, the killer scrambles to his car, while Rawlins struggles to fire shots at him. In a desperate bid to stop Martin, Rawlins guns his sedan. Swerves it across the street and smashes into Martin's stolen car before he can get it cranked. Witnesses provide the authorities with a description, but Martin shaves off the pencil-thin mustache and begins on his next criminal endeavor. Later, we learn that Rawlins has died from his gunshot wounds.When he isn't committing crimes, Martin modifies his stolen equipment and then rents it out to Reeves Electronics Laboratory run by Paul Reeves (a bespectacled Whit Bissell) who urges Roy to join his firm. Roy brings in his television projection set and leaves before the original owner arrives. The owner identifies the equipment and calls the police. At this point, Captain Breen (Roy Roberts of My Darling Clementine) assigns Sgt. Marty Brennan (Scott Brady of Dollars) and Sgt. Chuck Jones (James Cardwell of The Sullivans) to the case and they question Reeves. Martin calls up and Reeves tells him that he has sold his television projector. Jones gets Reeves to tell Martin that he has his dough ready and to come in that night and pick it up. Later, Martin surprises everybody that night and shoots Jones, paralyzing him and knocking Brennan unconscious. In the process, however, Martin is wounded by Jones. In a scene that predates First Blood, Martin digs out the slug himself with sterilized doctor's tools. Meanwhile, the crime technician, Lee (Jack Webb of Dragnet) gradually pieces together information about Martin until Brennan suggests that he use something that allows witnesses of Martin's robberies to create a picture of him. It seems that Martin has been on a robbery spree and uses the storm drainage system underneath Los Angeles to escape from the authorities.Anyway, Captain Breen relieves Brennan from the case since the latter has made no headway in capturing Martin and Breen is feeling the heat from his own superiors. Later, during one of his visits with the recuperating Jones, Brennan learns that the Breen is trying to rattle him enough to come up with a fresh approach to the case. Brennan starts looking where he didn't before&#151;in the surrounding police departments. Eventually, he uncovers Martin's secret and his real name Roy Morgan. Breen masquerades as a milk man and finds where Morgan lives. The long arm of the law assembles with cops, guns, and tear gas to flush Morgan out. Predictably, Morgan flees to the storm drainage system with the LAPD in hot pursuit. They don't aim to let him escape their clutches again! This tightly-knit thriller is pretty good, even by 1948 standards. The police are depicted like idiots during the first hour because they constantly underestimated the resourceful adversary who even keeps a shotgun stored in the underground drain system. John Alton creates a marvelous sense of atmosphere with images that highlight the area above the heads of the participants. The photography in the storm drainage system is terrific stuff! Scott Brady is good as the cop determined to bust Morgan, and his Sgt. Brennan's one characteristic that is emphasized is his shortage of matches for his cigarette habit.

What makes it especially hard for police and detectives is Martin hasn't any prior convictions and has a keen ability to stay very well to himself.

After paralyzing a detective who was staking out the electronic man's place of business, Martin begins holding up several establishments such as liquor stores for cash.

The narrative device also serves as a tool for explaining key elements in the plot. We get both sidesthe point of view from both Martin and how he prepares & the law enforcement procedure at trying to get him. I believe a key to the film's success is the boy-next-door youthfulness of Basehart who doesn't have a face of a cold blooded killer until it twists in rage and we the unmasking of the true monster. But, the film is most importantly a study in how to catch a man who is so elusive that it takes much heartache and headache to catch him. The film's presentation is as cold as ice, like the killer, but is fascinating to see unfold over the duration.The final chase through the sewers is very reminiscent of Carol Reed's The Third Man, but was actually made a year prior to that famous film.

Having Jack Webb around adds to the Dragnet like darkness of the film. There is a police artist and some borderline DNA stuff going on. It's always a contrast between the amazing efforts made to identify the guy and the incompetence of catching him. One thing that brought back some memories.

Over the years, my brother and I would sit and listen to these stories being retold by the officers who worked the case. Comment #1 I can never recall him being referred to as Tough Guy. Comment #2 The movie, He Walked by Night was produced by the Eagle Lion Studio. My father was contacted and asked if he would give the technical direction. While doing so, he met a down-and-out actor named Jack Webb. Webb had a ten minute part as a lab technician in the movie and was not depicted as a detective. During one of their conversations, Wynn mentioned to Webb, It's a shame they don't have a radio show that depicts the actual policeman and the work that he does. At that time, the lead detective show was Sam Spade. They derived the title, He Walked by Night, to the fact that he committed most of his crimes at night. The film, itself, was not accurate. The use of the storm drains in the City of L. A. was strictly Hollywood. When Walker was captured he was located in a rented bungalow located on Argyle St. in L. A. Three officers, Donohoe, Wynn and Rombo, entered this location at 230 A.M. surprising Walker while he slept. A physical confrontation took place. Walker was armed with a machine gun at which time he succeeded in getting the clip into the weapon. Donohoe yelled, Shoot him, Marty! He's got the gun! Wynn took him down, striking him numerous times over the head with the butt of his 38 revolver. Walker, still struggling and in possession of the gun, Wynn then put the gun to Walker's back and fired twice. It was noted that when Wynn examined his gun, he had cracked the grip of the pistol. When Walker was placed in the ambulance, he asked Wynn, Do you have any kids? Wynn said, Yes, I have two boys. Walker replied, You're lucky because you came close to not seeing your kids again. At that time, he told Wynn, they will never execute for this crime and I will live to see the day where I will kill you. In 1959, Walker succeeded in escaping from Atascadero. Three days later he was captured. Wynn was forced to strap his 38 again after two years of retirement.If you desire any more information regard Sgt.

The film is set in Los Angeles, which is interesting considering so many of the crime dramas of this era are usually set in New York. Richard Basehart plays a sociopath who kills a police officer when he stops him on the street for suspicious behavior. Basehart is also an electronics genius, and he can hear radio police calls in his home. He also manages to elude the police for months -- this man is no ordinary criminal. He is smart, alert, and a complete loner. Detectives Scott Brady and Roy Roberts are the two actors who take the lead in tracking Basehart down. The film takes us into the streets of Los Angeles (population 2 million in 1948!) and in underground storm water tunnels, which Basehart cleverly uses for his get-aways from cops. This film is reportedly based on a true story about a killer who eluded cops for months and terrorized the city in 1947. The actors who play the cops are good ones, but it is Richard Basehart who is the real star of the film. He plays his part brilliantly -- he doesn't hit a false note. Basehart had the looks and talent to be a major player in Hollywood, but he never really became a big star. What a shame.

Yes, Officer Rawlins died some time after being shot by Morgan/Martin (Richard Basehart), and there was that hit on Detective Chuck Jones (James Cardwell), but he lived, and it didn't seem to me that murder was the focus of the story. It had more to do it seems, with the cunning displayed by Basehart's character in pulling off small time burglaries, then graduating to armed robbery, all the while leaving no clues and eluding authority's attempt to track him down.Nor does the film completely fill the noir definition with it's lack of a slick and dangerous femme-fatale. What it does have though for fans of these Forties era flicks, is Jack Webb in a nice warm-up for his radio and TV 'Dragnet' series, filling the role of a forensics cop who provides the first lead to Roy Martin's real identity. The neatest twist of the whole story, for me at least, was watching Martin maneuver his way around the underground LA sewer system, and pull a rifle out of a carefully selected hiding spot! Now there was a guy who did his homework.He Walked by Night is one of those ubiquitous public domain titles you'll find packaged by itself or in compilations of a hundred pictures or more. It's a bit slow in spots but generally manages to hold interest and entertain in a satisfactory way. Scott Brady fans will get a kick seeing him here at the tender age of twenty four but looking considerably older. A year later, he would travel cross country as a customs agent to go up against Yul Brynner in 1949's Port of New York.

The finest performance in the film, and the one that sticks with you, is by Whit Bissell. It was the only thing I vividly remembered from my initial viewing years ago when I saw this again recently. The killer is played by Richard Basehart. His approach is to portray the man as a cold and calculating person with no feelings, extremely clever and vain about his cleverness. However, although Basehart is entirely convincing at this level, there is no greater depth to the portrayal. And one reason for this is that the script does not give us any motivation for Basehart being a cold-blooded killer, and we are not at all convinced that he is really a psychopath. The story emphasis is on the manhunt with no clues, rather than on why this man is doing this. Scott Brady is robust as a police officer determined to find the killer. Jack Webb has a small part and many people have pointed out that this film was the origin of the famous police series 'Dragnet', in which Webb later became famous as the lead (it started as a weekly radio series with a notorious brief introductory musical theme which every kid alive at the time hummed). Apparently, the real killer on whom this one is based was named Erwin Walker, and he was pardoned by a particularly objectionable and bad governor of California named Pat Brown, father of the dotty Gerry Brown who also became a Governor. Too many Browns, not to mention Gordon! Down with all Browns. This film is just not as compelling as it should be. However, the highlight is definitely the use of the Los Angeles storm drains by the criminal, which must have inspired the later use of the Vienna sewers in 'The Third Man', although the idea of using sewers for renegades was really pioneered by the Poles of Warsaw, as depicted later in Wajda's 'Kanal'.

What distinguishes it from dozens of similar movies is the very energetic light-and-shadow work by cinematographer John Alton. Alton's brief must have been, in the first place, to disguise the low-budget deficiencies of the production (unable to shoot sound on location, unable to build elaborate sets); and he succeeds in covering them up, but then he keeps going, and going . . . until the film becomes a black-and-white graphic-arts explosion. (The editing is a let-down though, merely smooth and adequate, not up to the mark of the photography.) The sound design (although it wasn't called that back then) is sharp and inventive too, especially the noises and voices at a crowded streetside investigation late at night, and the echo after the concluding gunshot.A promising young actor named Richard Basehart, still new to films, plays the killer at the center of it all, and he holds us right from the start; but as it soon becomes apparent the film isn't going to explore his character, it turns into a hollow exercise. There's a scarily intense self-surgery - no on-screen gore, but we can read every detail in Basehart's face. The other actors are a drab bunch, especially the ones playing cops, with the exception of Jack Webb, who takes advantage of his colleagues' mopishness to indulge in some shameless scene-stealing it's petty theft - he ought to be ashamed. Dependable Whit Bissell plays a shopkeeper, dependably.

This movie seems to be ahead of its time in several ways. Unlike other crime dramas of the thirties and forties, there is a lack of hammy dialog, no girl with a heart of gold standing behind her man - either criminal or police officer, and no background information given explaining the criminal's motivation, or any of the other plot gimicks that run from the early talkie gangster films into the crime dramas of the post-war era. Also, there is no mystery for the audience to solve, as the actions of the police and the criminal are clearly shown to the audience. The only question is when and how their paths will finally cross.Richard Basehart, who portrays criminal Roy Martin in this film, really owns the movie. He shines as a relentless sociopath whose only tender spot seems to be for his own dog. Because he doesn't associate with known criminals and lives quietly, he is exceptionally hard to track down. Basehart actually has very few lines, but he is great at expressing his state of mind through his gestures and facial expressions. The film's excellent cinematography surrounds Basehart's character with cold, deterministic pools of light and darkness so that he really does seem like some type of shadow of evil that has descended upon the city. The killer in the film was actually based on real-life criminal Erwin Walker. However, wanting to concentrate on both the crime solving techniques involved and the habits of the criminal, this interesting and lengthy backstory was omitted to keep the film tight and fast paced.Erwin Walker was a brilliant student at the California Institute of Technology, a radio dispatcher for the police department in his native Glendale, and something of a hero as a lieutenant in charge of a radar unit on Okinawa during World War II. Walker returned from overseas duty deeply disturbed, and set out on a crime spree of more than a dozen holdups and burglaries to raise money for construction of a death ray machine that he thought would somehow make another war impossible. Twice Walker shot his way out of police traps, escaping through the labyrinth of storm drain pipes under Los Angeles and eventually killing a police officer. He was sentenced to death, but was later found to be insane by prison psychiatrists, and his execution was postponed indefinitely. California governor Pat Brown commuted his sentence to life in 1961, and in 1971 Walker was granted a new trial due to his original confession having been found to be coerced. Remarkably, he was acquitted at the second trial, changed his name, married, and took a job as a chemist somewhere in Southern California, never to be heard from publicly again.Thus, just or unjust, the inspiration for this movie had quite a different outcome than the villain in the film. Of course, in 1948, nobody would have dared write such a screenplay and have expected to ever work in Hollywood again.I had always considered Cagney's portrayal of Cody Jarrett in White Heat (1949) to be the first real off-the-wall psycho killer in a major film. But I now think that distinction should probably go to Basehart's portrayal of Erwin Walker in this movie. It's obviously a matter of opinion, but I can't think of a killer this menacing in a film prior to 1948.

We all know who the killer is &#x96; that's not a secret to the viewers. But we don't know if, when and how the police will discover who he is, and how if he will come to justice. I remember watching the first Dragnet series on TV growing up in the 1950s. Detective Sergeant Joe Friday was known to most Americans far away from LA. It's interesting that the star of that long-running series &#x96; and its return to TV a few years later for another four-year run, is in this film. Jack Webb here plays Lee Whitey, the head of the police forensics lab. I think he actually has a more lively character in this film than he played as the matter-of-fact, seemingly droll Sgt.

The story is set in Los Angeles in the late 1940s.This is not a whodunit. We see the killer's face early in the film. The plot is more of a cat-and-mouse game between the cops and the criminal, with the criminal usually two steps ahead of the cops. Midway through, this cat-and-mouse game plays out nicely in night scenes with minimal dialogue. Roughly two-thirds of the plot involves police making efforts to find the guy; the other third involves the criminal in his activities and his attempts to evade capture. One thing that detracts from the story is that although this criminal was a killer, most of the crimes recounted in the plot involve robbery and burglary, and that renders the story less intense.He Walked By Night is one of the first, if not the first, films to use composite drawings as a procedure to identify the perp. The film also has the distinction of being the production that led to the Jack Webb TV series Dragnet in the 1950s. Webb plays a small part in this film as a lab technician.Lots of shadows and stark B&W lighting yield interesting noir visuals. But the film stock is poor. Best visuals occur toward the end where the plot is set in a series of underground storm drains. The visual effects of flashlights, together with echoes in these cavernous tunnels, render some of the most evocative scenes in the film.Music is intermittent and nondescript. Acting is acceptable. The V.O. narrative is overbearing and annoying at times. It's obvious that the story is told, and the script is written, from the POV of the L.A. police department, not from Hollywood scriptwriters. As such, the overall tone is cold and clinical.A story that's based mostly on robberies and burglaries, and an annoying V.O. narrative, combine to make the film less intense and more dated than contemporary films. Yet He Walked By Night has some significant distinctions that make it important historically. And the script is interesting because the events really happened.

This movie does not deliver in that regard. The police procedure scenes are very documentary-style, even the way the police talk to each other, so you lose taught-ness during these scenes. Then, you will quickly cut to a taught, noir-style scene involving the bad guy's schemes. Interesting story and script, but the fact that it is based on a true police case necessitated the documentary style. But it tries to be a noir, too. I think what we have here is some sort of genre clash.Technically well made and filmed, and watchable despite its flaws in concept.

Howard Hawks did it some fifteen years before with `Criminal Code' and `Scarface', though he was more interested in the racket as a social phenomenon. `He walked by night' is a very crafted mixture of stylized noir and journalistic document, told both as a police procedural and from the viewpoint of the cold murderer on the run. It precedes a type of film explored later by Samuel Fuller (`Pick up on South Street'), Fritz Lang (`The big heat') and Joseph H. Lewis (`Gun crazy', `The big combo'). There's something stripped in the urban setting of this picture, a nakedness that is also conveyed by the acting of the performers. That's the best of the film. It's modern without being avant-gard (Nicholas Ray's pessimism was yet to come). The worst is the school-masterish intrusions upon the audience, especially during the first half. We feel the director at our elbow explaining, interpreting, interfering with our impressions. The mockery tone of the voice over that narrates eases this up a bit and at the end one wonders if the whole thing is nothing but a big joke, since our sympathy is with Basehart all the time, despite the cops' noble attempts.

Still the scenes with the detective dressed as a milk man investigating, the police surrounding the house and the climatic chase through the underground tunnels make for exciting viewing.

Base in LA of yesterday...not today.More or less directed like an episode o Dragnet. I used to love Dragnet when I was a kid and they had it in re runs on local TV.Unfortunately this movie feels very dated.The plotIn the Post-World War II, in Los Angeles, a criminal shoots and kills a police officer in the middle of the night. Without any leads, the chief of the LAPD assigns Sgt. Chuck Jones and Sgt. Marty Brennan to investigate the murder and apprehend the culprits. When the dealer of electronics devices, Paul Reeves, is caught selling a stolen projector, the police identifies the criminal, and connects him to other unsolved robberies. Using the witnesses of his heists, they draw their face, but the true identity of the smart and intelligent criminal is not disclosed. The perseverance of Sgt. Marty Brennan in his investigation gives a clue where he might live.

Jack Webb has a cameo as the police technical expert; it's easy to see that Webb lifted some pieces of the film for his Dragnet TV series.  Also of interest is the performance by a very young Scott Brady. "},{"Title":"Dullness of facts","Date":"29 August 2013","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Film-Noir, Thriller","Review":" This isn't real noir by my definition which is ruled by hallucinative memory, seduction and amused fate. But others define noir as a style, in which case this does have the shadows. It's from that genealogy of noir with roots in westerns and gangster movies with its purer landscape, crisper asphalt and desert god. Viewers who want simple and efficient world mechanics will find this to their taste, no frills here.Supposedly it's just the facts. But if you look at the cinematic facts of the movie?An omniscient Filekeeper narrates. None of the cops is distinguishable as a distinct human being. And no one does anything that doesn't serve the narrated facts on file.. Crushing.It isn't alone that times have changed, though we have since seen this template countless times on TV. It isn't even that the film is populated by simple folks, mostly cops, or the case is exceedingly simple, which it is. The Naked City of the same year takes a similar 'factual' approach but doesn't feel so stolid. It may altogether be that we're hardwired to much faster thinking and simultaneously a more nuanced 'real' behavior. It probably just comes down to stiff acting and script.I was amused by a scene where the police commissioner has gathered all the witnesses in a room to help profile a picture of the suspect. Needless to say the sketched picture turns out exactly like the guy we're looking for. But watch the witnesses as they fill in the details from memory, the cadence, the observations, the clean delivery. It's like you've gone into a bar where everyone has been told to pretend that he's in a bar.Still, remarkable LA. In spite of everything, I might include it in my Los Angeles project.Noir Meter 1/4 "},{"Title":"Typical second feature of its time.","Date":"16 November 2008","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Film-Noir, Thriller","Review":" This 1948 film noir is similar in style to Mark Hellinger's excellent 1947 movie classic. NAKED CITY which took place in New York City, One could say HE WALKED BY NIGHT is 'Naked City-Los Angeles'.Like any sequel it is not as good as the original.The main reasons to see this film today, are the following. It was Richard Basehart's first leading role, his first role was the year before in the much superior REPEAT PERFORMANCE.Here we can see the reasons why he became such a popular actor.Also we have Scott Brady in one of his usual fine performances. In a smaller but important role is Jack Webb, He & a buddy got the idea for DRAGNET from this movie,some of Dragnet's famous lines originated here.Also mainly for us OLDER viewers we will see 2 Child stars from the 1930's in a line up scene. Billy Mauch---Prince & the Pauper & Tommy Kelley---Tom Sawyer. We only see glimpsesIn the cast are popular actors of the time who were featured in that up & coming medium called Television.This movie is good, do not expect anything great. as it is nowhere as good as some of the comments noted here.Ratings **1/2 --out of 4---73 points--out of 100---IMDb 6 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Silly, but looks great","Date":"2 January 2001","Score":"1 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Film-Noir, Thriller","Review":"  The opening stentorian voice letting us know that this was all true was probably very effective when this movie was made, but it, and the movie, have not aged well. Instead of acting as a narrator, the voice merely provides an excuse for the director and screenwriter to get away with a movie that doesn't tell an interesting story.I accept this movie as an early experiment in re-staged documentary - one that fails that test also - but it doesn't hold together as a movie. The final climax isn't nearly as exciting as it should have been had this been a real movie, and the villain was a lot more careless than he was made out to be.Despite its faults, some of the shots are terrific, like the single flashlight in a running man's hand. Innovative stuff for the time in which it was made.

Right up until the predictable climax he wins every battle with the police, who are trying to identify and then capture him. The manner in which he keeps eluding his pursuers is just not credible. This is a thoroughly forgettable example of the film noir genre.  "}]
