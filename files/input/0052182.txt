Wendy Hill excels as the keeper of the hotel, herself involved in an affair with Lancaster. Rod Taylor and Audrey Dalton do well as the young lovers caught in the claustrophobic setting dominated by snooping elderly women.A very worthwhile, sensitive study of people trying to spend quiet days at a resort--very disparate people leading separate lives who must cope with their differences. Deborah Kerr gives a deeply felt, genuinely moving performance opposite Niven's blustery major and Cooper's exquisitely well-mannered but narrow-minded mother. Niven deserved his Oscar for his moments of quiet desperation and crumbling of character--but Kerr is equally fine and should have had Academy recognition for this role instead of just a nomination.Wendy Hiller is especially impressive and surely deserved her Best Supporting Actress Oscar as the innkeeper who deals intelligently and sympathetically with the various crises facing her guests.

It is a masterpiece of an intimate portrait of lonely people who reside at an English seaside hotel and how their lives are crisscrossed by destructive cruelty when they pretend to be what they are not.David Niven won the Acadamy Award--and rightfully so--for his portrayal of the lonely Major Pollack who embellishes his military past in an attempt to garner the adulation of the overly protected and withdrawn Sybil played superbly by Deborah Kerr. Gladys Cooper turns in a powerful performance as Sybil's mother, the hotel's matriarch and controlling force. Obsessed with stifling her daughter's independence, she refuses to allow Sybil any freedoms and snuffs out every one of her attempts to gain her own life. It is out of this twisted control that she poisons her daughter's respect and friendship with Pollack by attempting to destroy his reputation. The romance between Burt Lancaster and ex-lover Rita Hayworth weaves through the story as an excellent subplot. When Hayworth, a glamorous but lonely cover girl, shows up unexpectedly to get Lancaster, the pair thrash out their past failed relationship. The only negatives are Rod Taylor and his fiancée who are pretty much an afterthought in the film and do little more than provide a scandalous intermission for the Niven--Cooper confrontation. And Wendy Hiller, The manager and owner of the hotel, towers as the one character who stands up to Cooper and her poisoning of Niven. When Lancaster passes her up for Hayworth, she accepts it with dignity and character.It is, however, the final scene in which Niven enters the breakfast room after being shamed by Cooper's calumny that serves as the film's shimmering jewel. Kerr acknowledges Niven, the others follow suit and reocognize Pollack humanely, and you practically hear the audience applaud when Sybil stands up to her twisted mother. It is the supreme moment; for the characters have established a humane connection among separate tables. What a powerful finale as the camera draws back through the breakfast room window, the theme song tugs at your heart, and the guests resume their lonely lives.SEPARATE TABLES is a powerful drama and a fantastic study of the pain that springs from human alienation and distrust.

The stories involving Burt Lancaster and Rita Hayworth and the one involving David Niven and Deborah Kerr were presented separately. Fortunately producers Burt Lancaster, Harold Hecht, and James Hill had the good sense to hire Terrence Ratigan to stitch the two acts together into one well done coherent drama. Came out rather nicely.Burt and Rita's story involve a former married couple who's volatile personalities make it impossible for them to live together and their sexual attraction makes it impossible for them to function without. Lancaster is a working class writer and Hayworth is a chic fashion model. Different temperaments and different worlds. Lancaster in fact is now engaged to Wendy Hiller, the proprietress of the hotel everyone is staying at.Deborah Kerr is the shy and plain daughter of a domineering Gladys Cooper who is essentially playing the same role she did in Now Voyager. Kerr is attracted to the hale and hearty Major played by David Niven. But Niven is not all he claims to be. He's not a major from Montgomery's Eighth Army, but rather a former lowly supply lieutenant who never saw any combat. And he's got a sexual problem in that he likes to molest women in dark places like movie theaters. In fact he was arrested for it in a nearby town and is panic stricken that the rest of the residents will find out and see through him.The Major is one of Terrence Rattigan's most personal creations. Rattigan was a gay man living in the pre-Stonewall era when such topics were not talked about. Noel Coward was about as explicit as one could get in British society. The Major was a man playing a role in his whole life and gay people before Stonewall did just that, presenting a facade to the world at large. If Separate Tables were written today, I've no doubt David Niven's character would be explicitly gay.David Niven had one of the strangest careers in Hollywood. He was a man of acting ability this film certainly proves it. But producers always looked no farther than him as a debonair charming leading man. He carried a host of mediocre films by dint of charm. Separate Tables is one of the few films where he really does create a three dimensional human being.David Niven was also one of the most popular individuals in Hollywood. As charming in real life as he was on the screen, he was a great raconteur with a host of stories that kept everyone at gatherings entertained. His friends included people of all political persuasions from Humphrey Bogart to William F. Buckley, Jr. That and the fact that Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier split the vote being both nominated for The Defiant Ones got David Niven the Best Actor Oscar in the only time he was ever nominated.Ironically though the Oscar really did nothing for his career. He went right back to playing the same charming lightweight roles for the most part the rest of his life.Wendy Hiller got an Oscar in the Best Supporting Actress category. Her's is a subtle understated performance. She's a wise and compassionate woman that Wendy. In love with Burt Lancaster she sees what her duty is in that relationship and she's ready to be a friend to David Niven when Gladys Cooper wants him expelled from the hotel.What a pity Deborah Kerr never won an Oscar other than an honorary one in the Nineties as a lifetime achievement. Her role as Sybil is about as different from Anna Leonowens in The King and I as from the sluttish Mrs. Holmes in From Here to Eternity. Typecast as prim and proper ladies at first, a backup to Greer Garson at MGM, Kerr broke out with an astonishing range of parts in the Fifties. She never gets the credit due her.Intelligent and literate, Separate Tables is old fashioned considering the times it was written in. But the characters absorb you in their problems and you leave it with the fervent wish that they all find some healing together or apart.

A Grand Hotel-type of story that takes place at a quaint English inn by the sea, it features any number of interesting characters, marvelously depicted by a host of great talents. Thus, we get a love triangle between Burt Lancaster, his ex-wife Rita Hayworth (40 years old in this film and still looking very pulchritudinous) and the charming hotel owner Wendy Hiller, who really did earn her Best Supporting Actress Oscar here. We meet the repressed mess of a spinster played by Deborah Kerr, as well as her impossibly overbearing mother (Gladys Cooper, doing here what she did to Bette Davis in 1942's Now, Voyager). We get to know retired Army major David Niven, and learn his dark secrets. (Niven, too, earned his Oscar for this fine portrayal; he also costarred with Kerr in another 1958 film, Bonjour Tristesse.) And finally, we encounter a pair of young lovers, Rod Taylor and the yummy Audrey Dalton, who can't decide if they should marry or not. Many dramatic encounters abound (some of them sexually frank for 1958), and Hayworth's mature and adult performance might come as the pleasantest surprise of the bunch. Personally, I would say that big Burt picks the wrong gal to go off with at the film's conclusion, but I suppose that this is a matter of personal taste. The bottom line here is that this classic film is a wonderful treat for viewers who appreciate good screen writing and who relish deliciously served acting by a bunch of real pros. And this nice, crisp-looking DVD only adds to the pleasure. So do yourself a favor and check into the Beauregard Hotel!

His portrayal of an alcoholic man who gets a visit from his ex-wife (Hayworth) at the hotel he resides is again different from the boisterous, oafish guy that I always believed him to be when I was younger.  Also at the hotel are a varied group of characters &#150; including an oppressive woman who lords over her timid spinster daughter (Kerr) and a retired Army officer with some secrets, (Niven) who are all taken care of by the distant, yet sincere proprietress, Pat Cooper (the amazing Wendy Hiller).  The film encompasses all of their separate plot lines, and interweaves them gradually until the climatic ending.  There was no action in this film, just wonderful, straight melodrama and some great writing and acting.  A year later, Lancaster and Hecht, the producers behind this film, went on to produce `Sweet Smell of Success', which is infinitely more searing and dark, but it was interesting to see the precursor to that film.

It was very odd watching Bowles, whom I have seen playing so many upper crust comic types as in The Irish R.M. on television, here playing two serious parts a recovering alcoholic who meets his ex-wife at a hotel he is staying at, and a bluff, good natured military man who disgraces himself - and is facing ostracism as a result - in the same hotel. But these were separate plays, and each well done. Rattigan was a master (possibly the last one) of the well made play that Shaw condemned as artificial and fake. The well made play Bernard Shaw talked about was the type championed by the French dramatists Planche and Victorien Sardou. Structurally they were perfect, with the concentration on plot mechanism so strong as to diminish everything else. Shaw felt the play should say something. He failed to admit that some of his own plays (among his early ones) like Caesar And Cleopatra and Arms And The Man were well made plays, with his own wit added. He also failed to notice that in the hands of a good dramatist (like Rattigan) a well made play could be very strong The Winslow Boy, The Browning Version, Separate Tables - the credits prove the point.As has been pointed out in another of these reviews Rattigan rewrote the plays as one play. This was not too difficult, as the only character in the two who was the same was the hotel manager (Wendy Hiller). Her part was built up a little (in the original she is a close friend of the Burt Lancaster character - here they have a relationship). Frequently people recall David Niven's dramatic triumph and Oscar in Separate Tables as the disgraced military man, but Hiller won her best supporting Oscar here (she did not win it for her lead performances in Pygmalion, Major Barbara, or I Know Where I'm Going). She deserved it, as a woman who sadly sees her chance for happiness swept away, but pulls herself together because she is a grown-up with responsibilities. Lancaster and Rita Hayworth were formerly married (he a rising Labor Party politician, she a wealthy woman) only to find the tensions of his political career and their tempestuous relationship led to an act of violence that ended the marriage. But Hayworth finds she can't live without Lancaster, and he is willing to consider it again - as their play continues. Will they do it or not?Niven is a bluff, hail-fellow-well-met type, who claims he was a Major in the army. He happens to be very close to Deborah Kerr, the daughter of autocratic Gladys Cooper. Kerr is quite brow-beaten, but Niven encourages her to try to think for herself. Then it turns out he has committed a sin - he broke the law by performing a dirty act, and was caught. Cooper, who hates anyone who stands up against her, learns of it, and uses it to cause Kerr to break with Niven, and to then try to get the hotel to force him out. Will she succeed or not?Niven played his role with a degree of regret and humiliation rarely seen by his fans in three decades of film comedies. I have mentioned that he had a dark side, but this was one of the few times it was given full strength. It was worth waiting for, as he was superb.So too were Hayworth, Kerr, Cooper, and the supporting cast. Rod Taylor and Audrey Dalton were good as the young married couple. But typically good was old Felix Aylmer. As the mild mannered professor who is willing to listen to Cooper's arguments about the need to get rid of that pervert for the sake of the hotel's reputation, and then gradually gets fed up with her self-righteous egotism until he starts leading a reaction against it he gave a terrific performance. He too deserved some recognition, but only his fans can give it to him now.

Her Sybil is dominated by her mother (excellently played by Gladys Cooper), repressed, plain, and rather odd.  David Niven plays Major Pollock, a war-story windbag with some disturbing secrets.  Niven won the best actor Oscar for his performance.  However, on the second viewing of this film, his and Kerr's acting seemed showy and became a little irritating.  I'm not so sure they stand the test of time.The less shrill moments with Wendy Hiller (also excellent), Lancaster, and the lovely, involving Hayworth were a welcome respite.  Hayworth, more than anyone else, will break your heart in this film.  She makes you care about what happens with her character, Ann.  Perhaps their roles weren't as tied to an era as Niven's and Kerr's, but Hiller's, Lancaster's, and Hayworth's acting styles certainly seem more natural and real.Cathleen Nesbitt also turns in a warm and lovely performance as Lady Matheson.I definitely recommend this movie!

What anyone under the age of 30 would make of it, I cannot imagine. But for people old enough to remember having met or known people like the characters in this film (which is also a classic play by Terence Rattigan, revived from time to time on stage), this is a harrowing, searing examination of the interior recesses of fossilised people in a formal society of manners such as England was before the 1960s. The play/film is set in a seaside hotel at Bournemouth in England in the 1950s. It is peopled by lonely, stiff upper lip people who sit at separate tables in the communal dining room. The performances by numerous famous actors are absolutely staggering. David Niven gives certainly his finest performance in any film, well deserving his Oscar. Deborah Kerr leaves our jaws agape at her wholly convincing portrayal of a cringeing, crushed daughter of a tyrant mother who despite having entered middle age still says simperingly 'Yes Mummy, No Mummy' and is afraid of her own shadow. The film is actually dominated by two older women on the one hand, Gladys Cooper tyrannizes over the entire cast of characters with her Olympian certainties, pernicious control freakery, destructive and sadistic cruelty, all masked by 'proper manners', a 'concern for morality', and a view of herself as representative of a superior class of being, not to mention the upper class of society. She is one of those elegantly dressed older women who used to dominate all around them, gave themselves the airs of duchesses, or at least of the duchesses they imagined (since they had probably never met one), and who carried snobbery to its greatest heights. Cooper absolutely dominates the screen in every shot, and her arched brow or wrinkled nose of disapproval is enough to terrify a pontiff. And then there is the calm, emotionally ravaged, but practical and efficient hotelier, played by Wendy Hiller. She dominates her own scenes in turn, with her unique charm, and she well deserved her Oscar too. Poor Wendy has been in love with Burt Lancaster for years. But then his ex-wife Rita Hayworth turns up, whose cold glamour casts an arctic spell, and the intensity of her needs and her egotism threaten to turn the proceedings to ice, which will shatter into shards and leave everyone chilled at the heart. It is all done to perfection. Delbert Mann, who was such a brilliant director, here outdoes himself. The stagey 'set' of the hotel suggests a large, rambling stage set through which the camera relentlessly prowls. There is no attempt made to show 'the world outside', or to achieve realism beyond the walls of the Hotel Beauregard where the multiple dramas unfold. We all somehow understand that this is a play, but there is nothing uncinematic about it, quite the reverse. The underlying theme of all the stories in this film can be summed up in one word self-control. All of the characters' feelings are suppressed, all of their upper lips are as stiff as boards, all of their hearts are breaking, everything is appearance, but beneath the appearance there are the unheard screams, the cries, the agonies, the concealed feelings, and the sobs that are never heard because never uttered. The days when people could control themselves (albeit so often too much so, as we see here) are long gone. Nowadays it all hangs out, every last bit of it. Nothing is concealed any longer. And yet here we see a tableau of self-control presented to our eyes to remind us what everything was like just a short time ago, well within the living memories of half the people on the planet. And yet, as I said, no one under 30 could possibly comprehend even one iota of what is meant or represented by this study of a lost society, this museum of morals and manners that have all gone as completely as the dodo. There is such pathos in this film, as we suffer with these people whose torn hearts are pinned behind their backs, and who go through life helpless, flailing, and nearly lost. What a step back in time this is, so strongly and unforgettably portrayed. When the fossils are all inspected in the natural history museums of the future, will this one be amongst them? And will it inspire more awe than the triceratops? As an example of magnificent ensemble playing it is difficult to imagine this film being surpassed. It is an absolute masterpiece.

It's well worth watching if you want a good film that doesn't rely on these plot devices. However, before I get to the film in general, there is one odd thing I noticed early in the film. I knew that David Niven had been given the Oscar for Best Actor for this film, but I was bowled over by how incredibly broad and transparent his character was in the first five minutes of the film. To put it bluntly, he was the worst part of the film because I knew one of his big, dark secrets almost immediately--he simply came on too strong to possibly really be who he claimed to be! While 1959 was a pretty poor year for this Oscar category, to me Paul Newman clearly had a better performance of the nominees--clearly.The film is sort of like a slower paced and more subtle ensemble soap opera--kind of like what you might have seen if The Love Boat or Peyton Place had been written better and with less of the hysteria. And, instead of a small town or cruise ship, the location for this film is a rooming house in England. The concoction is very agreeable due to excellent writing and acting (aside from the one mentioned above). Burt Lancaster and Rita Hayworth were very agreeable and worth seeing--and it's odd Lancaster wasn't nominated for the Oscar instead of Niven (who, incidentally, seemed to have a lot less screen time!). However, my favorite in the cast was Gladys Cooper. This elderly actress was simply superb as the puritanical and overbearing resident. She was thoroughly hateful and this visceral reaction was why I liked her in the film so much.The film is so well done that it would a great film for young film makers to see (along with great 50s films like Marty and 12 Angry Men).

First, I was a terrible fan of Niven (odd, seeing as how I have seen very little of his movies) so of course, I learned what his Oscar win was.Separate Tables? Had no idea what that could be. In his bio, The Moon's A Balloon, Niven would refer to his Oscar win for the Major. He tripped going up the steps and received laughter. He sought to say I fell because I was loaded with so many good luck charms, . . .  but he paused after 'loaded' so it sounded like he was admitting he was drunk, and more laughter. He let it go at that. Lancaster, on the other hand, I had seen in From Here To Eternity, Rose Tattoo, Come Back, Little Sheba, Young Savages, Barnum, Airport and even The Cassandra Crossing so I had a bit of a clue what to expect from this guy, basically never blink and be ready to duck. I had actually rented Pygmalion to see both Wendy Hiller and Leslie Howard, and was thoroughly impressed by both. I knew Tables was her Oscar win as well, but still had no idea where she would go.Deborah Kerr. Totally new to me. Rita Hayworth. Ditto, but I did recall hearing about her problems later in life and what Gilda had done for her. Men go to bed with Gilda and wake up with Rita, she said. And a very young Rod Taylor!So now here they all were. Under one banner. I would get this movie in a set with Lillies of the Field, Mame and Pocketful of Miracles. Just something to watch and see what it is like, I thought. Then I would never watch it again. I just watched it again.It is truly watchable. This life, this existence, this order. Brittle and at peace. The boat is rocked, the cart is tipped. Will it steady once more?The occupants of the hotel are pretty much like a movie about persons trapped in an elevator. The criss-crossing is most prevalent when Hayworth and Kerr have scenes together. I wonder why no encounter ever occured between Hayworth and Niven? This was a totally different character for Niven and he made it work. It could have failed in lesser hands. Hiller was a prize. When I would first see her (I guess in Pygmalion) I thought she bore an uncanny resemblance to Vivian Vance from I Love Lucy, but she is much more than Vance could ever do. She maintains the air of what is going on in absolute properness right up to the end when she calls Niven Mr. Pollock and inquires about his staying.Deborah Kerr? She made me stop what I was doing every time. Taylor and who I take it is Audrey Dalton were the weak point. They should have been in the fishbowl, not observing outside. Cooper may have been an ugly old snob, but she is fun to watch. She even has her friend, Gladys, (notice that there would be a woman named Gladys and that Hiller's last name was Cooper, resulting in Gladys Cooper having to constantly call out to Gladys and Mrs. Cooper).She remains the only loose end however. How will Deborah now approach her mother after breakfast that final morning? The final scene at breakfast is a stunner to watch. I have watched just the end before, and after having watched the entire thing again, I held my breath, even tho I knew what would happen. I would inquire to my English mother what the title referred to; why was separate tables important, and I received a very British response. It is not proper to dine and associate with others not of your class and distinction.And yes, the feel of the hotel was apparent as well. You do feel like you know when someone turns a corner or exits through a door where they will be.Niven and Nesbitt would both refer to the television, but it is never seen. Good for the story, but a shame now, as it would be enligtening to see how these people handle television watching for this era.

Virtually every scene brings a powerhouse performance, even if the range of styles on view in this residential hotel is a lot wider than in any average movie.Any summary makes it sound grey and dull but Rattigan was quietly subversive and in its way, the ending is as revolutionary as 'If.' The Spoiler being that Brits at separate tables actually start to talk to each other!Planned as a vehicle for Vivien Leigh, who pulled out when husband Olivier chose not to direct it, the picture was well-received nevertheless and nominated for seven Oscars, two of which it won Hiller, who deserved hers and Niven, who quite frankly did not.Burt and Rita smoulder away in a different key altogether but that matters less and less. We get one of his classic still moments in the darkened bedroom. No one does still like Burt!I'm glad to see I'm not the only one to notice the delightful May Hallett as the eccentric horse-loving spinster. She's best remembered for Black Narcissus these days but this is just as splendid a piece of scene-stealing in a supporting rôle.I'm surprised no one has yet mentioned Fawlty Towers! This was clearly the model for the residents' list at that more comedic establishment the name of Sybil is here, even if the part changed rather a lot. The trans-Atlantic element was however preserved and the Major never unmasked or caught doing anything untoward in the Odeon! In its well-made way, Separate Tables is fully entertaining in itself; to rename it Waiting for Basil would be more than a little rude.It certainly won't please the kiddies but this is a film for grown-ups to catch up on.

This was typical of the era where the action takes place. Lonely individuals dwelt in these establishments because they couldn't, perhaps, afford other living arrangements. It is one of these seaside places where we are taken to observe how people lived and behaved in a civilized manner and formed friendships out of necessity to calm their own loneliness.The people one meets at the Beauregard Hotel are a motley crew indeed. There's the aging retired Major Pollock, who comes under scrutiny as the rest of the residents discover he is a man that loves to prey on unaccompanied ladies at the local cinema. The mere idea of having this sort of person among their midst sends an uptight Mrs. Roilton-Bell to ask the other guests to side with her in getting rid of this pathetic man. Little does she realize her own daughter, Sibyl, a spinster dominated by her mother, loves the Major secretly. His absence will be sadly missed by her because she has developed a fondness for the man in spite of all the faults and the lies this man tells everyone.The manager of the hotel, Ms. Cooper, has her own problems. She's in love with John Malcolm, a minor writer, that appreciates his whiskey much more than making a commitment to her. When his former wife, Ann Shankland appears one day, sends John over the edge. Secretly, he is still in love with her.At the end, things change quite a bit in favor of the disgraced Major Pollock, who heeds Ms. Cooper's advice and decides to stay after all. Where else could he live for what he is paying here? And the fact that he would have to stop seeing Sibyl, also weighs heavily in his decision, for he realizes he also likes the shy and sheltered woman.Terence Rattigan had written two one act plays which were adapted for the screen by himself and John Gay. The film was directed by Delbert Mann who showed an uncanny understanding for the material, loosely constructed to add the acting styles of Burt Lancaster, who was involved in the project and one of its stars, Rita Hayworth.David Niven, who plays Major Pollock, steals the film. He had one of the best roles of his career getting under the skin of this creepy old man who lies about himself to the other residents. He might be sexually starved and has to resort to chase unsuspecting women in movie theaters. Deborah Kerr, also gives a marvelous performance as Sibyl, the repressed woman who loves the Major.Burt Lancaster appears as John Malcolm, the weakest of all the actors in the film. Rita Hayworth is seen as Mrs. Shankland, John's ex-wife who clearly can't get him out of her mind. This is one of her best work in the cinema. The three English ladies, Wendy Hiller, Gladys Cooper, and Cathleen Nesbitt, do a wonderful job with their parts. It's a joy to see them in action.Although a bit dated, Separate Tables still is interesting to watch because of the excellent work of Mr. Niven.

In the original plays the four leading roles were played by the same two actors allowing them to display their versatility to the full given that 1) John Malcolm and Major Pollock and 2) Ann Shankland and Sybil Railton-Bell are poles apart. For reasons perhaps best known to himself and Hecht-Hill-Lancaster the Production company, Rattigan's adaptation calls for four actors and it's interesting if not fascinating to speculate that Burt Lancaster, the honcho at Hecht-Hill-Lancaster, recognised his limitations and knew he couldn't hack the Major whilst he was able to phone it in as the coiled-spring Malcolm. In the stage version the craftsman Rattigan allowed much more space to the other residents but viewers who see only the film will not miss this. Presumably Hecht-Hill-Lancaster tapped Delbert Mann as helmer mindful of their recent joint Oscar Winner Marty and for an American Mann does a workmanlike job with a quintessentially English story. The weakest links are Rod Taylor and Audrey Dalton and this is one instance where truncation is a positive given these mediocre actors. Otherwise the residents give solid support though more could have been made (as in the play) of Felix Aylmer's classics master waiting pathetically for the visit from an old pupil that never materialises. Cathleen Nesbitt and May Mallet are outstanding as is Gladys Cooper as the control-freak mother from Hell. I was never quite able to see Wendy Hiller as a love object, especially for someone as virile as Lancaster, though her acting is beyond criticism. Rita Hayworth was luminous as always but even she wouldn't have claimed to be taken seriously as a dramatic actress. This leaves Deborah Kerr and Oscar Winner David Niven. Both gave fine performances and if Niven's, seen today, seems a tad mannered, it certainly wouldn't have in 1958. Kerr, of course, excelled in tightly-wound spinsters. Though it can't quite match Rattigan's 'The Browning Version' - written for the stage some six year's before 'Separate Tables' and adapted some seven years earlier - it is an honourable second. Rattigan was not only one of the finest playrights of the twentieth century but also one of the finest screenrights both as adapter of his own and other writers (Graham Greene Brighton Rock, etc) and 'Original' screenplays (The Sound Barrier, The Way To The Stars) and this represents him at the top of his game.

The heart of the film concerns itself with people who really can't comfortably interact with other people. Or so they think. Circumstances require the assorted group at the Hotel Beauregard to realize that most people cannot - nor do they want to - separate themselves from others. The one character, the mother played by Gladys Cooper, that appears to be the one who has no problem with relating to others because she thinks most are beneath her is the one who hasn't the capacity for empathy or understanding. For those reasons, she ends up being the one character who we end up feel the most pity. This movie is a MUST see!

And I was more or less right in my assumption.The characters for the most part struck me as one-note. It doesn't surprise me really that Deborah Kerr was nominated for playing the repressed, borderline hysterical browbeaten spinster daughter who forms a devotion to the (Oscar-winning) David Niven's exaggerated British military character - Kerr's role is the flashiest, along with Niven's, and the least interesting I think. I really did like Wendy Hiller as the hotel's manager - she brought real warmth and empathy to this rather understated role and she, too, won an Oscar for it - this one well-deserved I think. There's so much emotion there in the scene where she's telling the American writer who she loves (Burt Lancaster) that he needs to go to his ex-wife (Rita Hayworth, in maybe the best performance I've seen from her) because she needs him, needs him far more than the lonely but basically accepting hotelier.Hayworth and Hiller bring this up to some extent from its dull, stagy direction and the rather obvious and predictable direction the characters are moving in, and the last scene with all the main characters gathered in the dining room as Kerr finally breaks (if only for a moment) from her domineering mother is also fairly powerful, so on the whole I can recommend this though I think you'd probably have to be a fan of some of the actors here to really get into it.

And in addition, confine a whole story to a few hours time. Playwrights are able to do this well. Film writers rarely try. The dominant view in film is that it is a visual medium and that dialogue should be used sparingly. I disagree, and pictures such as this support my disagreement. The few pictures that come to mind are this film, also Twelve Angry Men, My Dinner with Andre, and a french film named Un Air de Famille. I name these films not only because of their conservation of space and time, but also because they are so different.Separate Tables is filmed play, but the art direction, moving and weaving through the rooms, following around close to 10 characters, each having their own unique characteristics, interacting with each other is different from say Twelve Angry Men who are all confined in one room talking about one subject. In My Dinner With Andre, two people are in a restaurant just going back an forth about all sorts of different subjects. The final film, Un Air de Famille, a french film, deals with a family confined in a little cafe for 3 hours. During that time, everyone's normal behavior slowly gets peeled away and their true nature comes out. This type of film is almost akin to a mystery in that you figure out the truth in the end.Anyway, since this is a comment on Separate Tables, I'll state that the film was exceptionally well written, well directed, and well acted. I find Rita Hayworth probably the most beautiful actress of that era, but I must say, if I were Burt Lancaster, in this movie, I would have chosen to be with Wendy Hiller. Ms. Hiller's charactaer possesses a certain grace and her kindness and understanding to Lancaster's character and Hayworth's character elevates her above others with mere physical beauty. Although I must confess that I've had a mild crush on her ever since seeing her as in Shaw's Pygmalion. In my mind, there is no other Eliza Doolittle. (sorry Audrey!)

Deborah Kerr and David Niven, in particular, go out on a limb and play against type. The motley collection of thespians in this film are cocooned mostly in the interior of a little seaside hotel, mostly in the drawing and dining rooms and performing an adaptation of Terence Rattigan plays. It has been said that no man - or woman - is an island, but in this movie all the characters are islands, sitting, as they do, at separate tables in the dining room. It's a safe and non-intrusive arrangement - or is it? Join someone else at their table and the bees start buzzing. (I have also just seen another movie with a similar set-up - the main story in the enjoyable British drama Trio).Deborah Kerr is barely recognizable as a mousy, neurotic wallflower who fades into the scenery pretty quickly and stays there. She is attracted to David Niven's bombastic ex-military type with the preened moustache who ends his conversations with cheery-bye. He hides a secret - he's really a repressed nobody. Rita Hayworth is a shrew. She's either really nice or really awful - when she's really awful her speech becomes clipped. Burt Lancaster is her ex, an alcoholic writer who has a thing for the hotel's owner (Wendy Hiller). Rod Taylor is on hand in a sub-plot that barely registers. Gladys Cooper, as Kerr's mom, a pinched old prude, is the most fun. All of the characters elicit some sympathy and all of the acting is perfectly respectable, yet even with so much talent on hand, the movie seems rather ordinary. There are only intermittent sparks, even in the Hayworth/Lancaster rocky love story. It has little vigour and the melodrama seems subdued. When Kerr finally defies her mother the earth should have shook; instead there was a momentary blip on the dramatic scale.Separate Tables suffers badly from television-itis. It looks and feels like a well-dressed television studio production from the 1950's. Even some of the camera and dolly movements and Delbert Mann's awkward transitions between scenes reek of television (was the movie originally intended for the tube?). Had the original material been opened up and filmed on location with real exteriors maybe the fresh morning breeze would have cleared the air. As it is, the movie feels a little muffled and quaint.

That said, none of the main characters hardly seem drawn from reality, but once you concede the writer's dramatic licence, you have to admire his skill in their interplay and the well-managed conclusion which works too as an indictment against narrow-minded intolerance as the fellow-guests at last react against flinty old Lady Matheson (Cathleen Nesbitt) and her petty-minded outrage at and desired expulsion of David Niven's disgraced Major character. Niven won the Oscar for his performance and you can see why, moving from blustery, caddish bonhomie (his what what refrain really gets on your nerves as he himself honestly admits) to his awkward embarrassed demeanour at the end. In support, I also enjoyed the playing of Wendy Hiller as the school-marmy hotelier, Deborah Kerr as Nesbitt's sexually repressed daughter and Gladys Cooper as her put-upon friend who like the daughter rises up but gently to overturn the Major's victimisation and rehabilitate him.It doesn't all work, Lancaster and Hayworth's story seems to belong in a different play / film and the minor parts are too sketchily drawn (Rod Taylor and his randy girlfriend too obviously counterpointing the sexual gaucheness of Kerr's Sibyl) and a too obvious Margaret Rutherford type inserted no doubt to add some humour.I'm pretty sure it would have made for a better night out at the theatre than the cinema, but I wouldn't deny the play's elevation to a wider audience and certainly didn't regret checking in on this occasion.

Each star -- and this is an all-star cast -- is pitch perfect.The black and white cinematography of the hotel's Victorian interior, and each character, is gorgeous. If you like seeing beautiful images on screen, you may enjoy this film for that reason alone.For me, the problem was the overbearing nature of the screenplay.Terence Rattigan, the playwright of the stage play on which the movie was based, was a practitioner of the well made play. In the 1950s in England, new approaches to drama revolutionized the stage. Big Issues were being presented with New Frankness.Rattigan adopted some of the subject matter and new freedom of this revolution.So, you have a well made play that's trying to say something socially daring and important.The problem for me was that the architecture of the screenplay became the most obvious focus on screen -- not Burt Lancaster's great passion, not Rita Hayworth's seductive beauty, not David Niven or Deborah Kerr's pathos.Characters speak in full paragraphs, with complete punctuation. Characters who are supposed to be in thrall to great passions and confusions are able to deliver unbelievably well-crafted one-liners that sum up decades worth of life history.At a point when he is supposed to be being driven mad by passion, Burt Lancaster, portraying a working class, drunken writer, delivers a precise summary of the class and sexual issues at play in his relationship to Rita Hayworth, an upper class fashion model and sexual tease.Since this style of drama is out of fashion now, its intense stylization interfered with my suspension of disbelief. Lancaster's comments sound as incongruous as a chemistry lecture.The movie does deliver some genuinely touching moments. Wendy Hiller is never less than fantastic. She's utterly believable as an admirable, self-reliant woman.Deborah Kerr brought tears to my eyes, in spite of the humorous incongruity of seeing her and Lancaster together on screen here after their famous beach scene in From Here to Eternity. David Niven was also quite poignant.May Hallat, as the vaguely lesbian Miss Meacham, was a delightful hoot.Separate Tables is a fascinating film in its depiction of women. The female characters are all paired, with one good and one bad version of each.There are two young women, two working women, two older women -- one young woman is twisted (Deborah Kerr), the other is healthy (Rod Taylor's fiancée). There is one mean old lady (Gladys Cooper, who did the mean old lady so very well), and one nice old lady (Cathleen Nesbitt).

The story takes place at a seaside hotel in Bournemouth in off-season, where separate tables are prepared for its long-term tenants. Among them, there is the mousy but high- strung maiden Sibyl (Kerr), who has been through some disturbing mental states and is tyrannized by her snobbish mother Ms. Railton-Bell (Cooper). Sibyl is overtly attracted to the middle-aged Major Angus Pollock (Niven), who is constantly bragging about his army feats but also appears to conceal an ulterior motive related to his shady side. In the opening, he just returns to the hotel after a two-days outing, when Sibyl concernedly asks his whereabouts, his response sounds with an affectation of casualness, and as usual he excels in dodging Sibyl's affection. The hotel is run by the competent Pat Cooper (Hiller), who is in a secret relationship with the longest tenant John Malcolm (Lancaster), on this day, arrives Ann Shankland (Hayworth), a gracefully divine woman, who turns out to be Malcolm's ex-wife and their marriage has ended quite violently and uglily, she bears an ulterior motive to win him back, and for John, unexpectedly meeting her again dramatically stirs his feelings blended with anger, contempt, chagrin and attraction. Apart from those mentioned above, there are several old people, the good-hearted Lady Matheson (Nesbitt), the eccentric spinster Miss Meacham (Hallatt) and the ordinary Mr. Fowler (Aylmer); plus two young lovers Charles (Taylor) and Jean (Dalton), who are arguing about the prospect of tying the knot. The main narrative twist is about Major's true nature, after his darkest secret is exposed by the nosy Ms. Railton-Bell, everyone is pushed to take a vote of whether Major should be expelled from the hotel. Meanwhile, the confrontation between Ann and John also reaches the boiling point, surprisingly Pat becomes the intermediary even it is her own relationship is at stake. The next morning, all the drama comes to a close, Major divulges his feelings to Sibyl in a most straightforward way he can properly address. The tenants all express their stand on the case, Sibyl finally can utter a staunch rebuff to her mommy's dominion. Ann and John reconcile and rekindle their love. The central cast is all fully charged in this sensational melodrama with top-notch vivacity. Niven won a Leading Actor Oscar for the shortest screen-time, a little more than 20 minutes, but his naturalistic mannerism as a chronic liar whose minor peculiarity hampers his entire life is both realistically pathetic and farcically sympathetic (particularly when his nudge nudge wink wink behavior cannot lift one's eyebrows now). All he can do is to keep up appearances in order to remain his dignity, a self-torturing pattern, but the ending advocates a brighter outlook for him since puritanism smells rather putrid under any circumstances. Kerr, nominated for an Oscar as well, coherently exhibits her outstanding aptness in playing a character of frailty and neurosis; Hayworth, as gorgeous as she has ever been, also delivers a conceivably affecting performance against Lancaster's rigorous mien as the man who can never get over her no matter what. But in plain truth, their love story is a stock one, all the more it gives an enormous halo to Pat, whose sacrifice is much more vicarious for viewers, Cooper won an Oscar for Supporting Actress as well, a very creditable win indeed. Shot in fine black & white, Mann and DP Charles Lang deftly arrange the lighting effect to construct a sharp-contrasted presence, especially between Hayworth and Lancaster, to foreground the tension and sentiment. The accompanying score by David Raksin adheres to the course of the story development to perfection, also, Vic Damone's tuneful titular theme song is pertinent to demonstrate the solitude eternally resides in each individual, like the separate tables, when two hearts find their resonant frequency, it is a godsend which one should never shy away from.

A collection of characters, both long-term and short, at the aforementioned hotel, gather at the time of this narration, at various points in their lives. There are the (for those times, at that place) illicit unmarried couple, one of whom is more intent on the romantic getaway than the other, who'd rather focus on an upcoming examination.There is a mother-daughter couple, one of whom hold dominance/sway over the other, and that dynamic is painful for all those who behold them, including this viewer.There is the boorish ex-armyman, who's fulla stories that test everyone's patience, and attention-span, and who's completely oblivious to the effect he has on his fellow-person, and keep at it anyway. And the mainstay, of course, is the return of an old flame into a milieu where the one who lit that flame has seemingly moved on, to, let's just say, stabler pastures? hardly a powder-keg waiting to go up, but go up it does, with media, whispers and gossip doing their jobs quite effectively, until it all comes to a head. Once again, as with most of the works made in this time, very economical story-telling, and powerful monologues as well as dialogues from all characters, who put in strong performances. The score though, and this is something typical for flicks made in this time and period, is very in your face, and if one learns to ignore its manipulation, one will be rewarded for said effort. Kerr is almost unrecognizable, but Lancaster and Niven do their schtick, and that's not a bad thing, since I'm still not able to visualize anyone else doing what they've done here.

It has the intimacy of watching a one-act play. The acting is flawless. Each character earns the audience sympathy from the first moment they become engaged in the performance. When I recognized the film from having seen it on TV when I was very young, I dropped watching a couple of playoff games on TV to watch this film instead. The story is elaborate and delicious. The characters change and surprise as the plot takes unexpected twists. It is all held neatly together in the microcosm of the small hotel in classic fashion. This is the kind of movie people are referring to when they say they were watching old movies on TV. People who like old movies love this one. The subtleties and grace of a past era are wonderfully exemplified in this film while it delivers themes that are adult, complex, and controversial. All of this amidst the elegance of the setting. This is a beautifully directed, and superbly acted film that makes you glad you watched it.

Appears is the operative word. Astaire (who choreographed) carefully kept their routines within Hayworth's range, never challenging her beyond her capacities. But Hayworth completely lacked Ginger Rogers' lithe body fluidity and on screen electricity.Hayworth was stunningly beautiful, of course. But even in Lovelier there are moments when, not carefully lit, the forehead lines that were so apparent in later years (unless also carefully lit) were already apparent and fleetingly distracting.More to the point was how she was directed and photographed in Lovelier. She actually has very few lines. What she does have are usually brief and delivered in a relatively quick take before cutting away.She never makes emotional transitions in a scene. Rather, the camera cuts to a new angle when she's called on to register a different emotion. The primary goal at all times is to maintain her seemingly flawless facial beauty. Fine in a fluff piece like Lovelier.Cut to Separate Tables 16 years later.Hayworth is still beautiful if more mature. AGAIN she is never shown making an emotional transition in one shot cutaways are instead employed. The technique (to disguise her limited acting abilities) is particularly jarring in her dramatic scene in her bedroom with Burt Lancaster. On closer inspection, she poses from cut to cut rather than displaying her character's emotional arcs.Sure, she was supposed to be an aging model, all self-possessed poise. But not in that dramatic scene.Still, it's a fascinating lesson in how skilled film making disguises limited range. (For a heartbreaking account of the making of her last film, read Frank Langella's Dropped Names.)Terence Rattigan's play was forced to disguise the homosexual scandal of the Major's (David Niven) being arrested for soliciting men in dark movie houses, though the implication is fairly clear.Knowing the repression of homosexuality at that time makes Niven's performance even more involving; especially once the scandal is revealed to the boarders at the Beauregard.Niven's amazing performance (in only 16 minutes of screen time) is disarmingly deep. He goes from an almost comical figure to an exposed fraud with a dark secret since childhood, to a lost late-middle-aged man with no future, to the final hope of redemption.Niven shows all his character's subtle emotional transitions in sustained takes (unlike Hayworth).Deborah Kerr is fine and completely convincing, as always.Burt Lancaster gives another version of Burt Lancaster in not his finest hour. Sweet Smell of Success, The Rose Tattoo, Come Back, Little Sheba, Birdman of Alcatraz and Judgment at Nuremberg -- even Trapeze -- are better records of his talents. But he's always believable.The remaining cast, especially the nuanced Wendy Hiller, are terrific.Still, it's Hayworth's impression -- not her character's -- who lingers as something not quite real, not untalented, but unrealized and somewhat vacant. It's not her mental deterioration. It was there on screen from the beginning. She tried gamely throughout her career, and looked magnificent thanks to careful costuming, lighting and cinematography. But even with careful cutaway direction she seems little more than a paper doll -- and finally, tragically, just as fragile.

Taking dead-aim at intolerance, as well as examining the disappointments and compromises of adulthood, this is a remarkable piece of humanist drama and one of the most intelligent films to come out of Hollywood in the '50s.

No one else I know of lies with such sincerity","Date":"19 July 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" It sometimes seems as though most of Hollywood's 1950s stage adaptations were either based on a Tennessee Williams play, or directed by Elia Kazan, or both. 'Separate Tables (1958)' belongs to neither category, but nevertheless deserves to stand alongside the likes of 'A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)' or 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958).' Headlining the very distinguished cast are Burt Lancaster, David Niven, Rita Hayworth, Deborah Kerr, and Wendy Hiller, playing residents at a British country motel, each concealing secrets and hidden motives that don't remain hidden for long before the prying eyes of the house's gossipy old women. Though the entire story unfolds in the one location, the film's extensive motel set is nevertheless an impressive stage for the actors' talents, with Mann's versatile camera effortlessly switching between rooms and angles. The film takes in awkward conversations and intimate exchanges from all corners of the motel, weaving a tapestry of small, parallel stories (indeed, the screenplay was drafted by combining two related one-act plays by Terrence Ratigan). Some of the subject matter is fairly bold for its time, with sex and perversion playing important roles.'Separate Tables' is truly an actors' picture. The film is a Powell/Pressburger reunion of sorts. Kerr ('The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1945))' pulls off a difficult role as a mousy, painfully- shy young woman, her timidity so utterly complete that I could scarcely watch her out of pity. The performance highlights Kerr's wonderful versatility; she could alternate with ease between portraying introverts and extroverts (and even both within the same character, as in 'Perfect Strangers (1945)'). Burt Lancaster enters the film with a rather peculiar accent, but soon settles into his usual acting groove. Opposite him, Rita Hayworth is as beautiful as ever, with a tinge of the insecurity that comes with middle-age. David Niven ('A Matter of Life and Death (1946)') won an Oscar for his bumbling, Latin-mangling WWII Major, an amusing yet poignant depiction of a social outcast. According to Niven's biography The Moon's A Balloon (1972), a prominent rival- studio producer tried to sabotage the actor's Oscars campaign by spreading a false rumour that he had attended the stage-show dozens of times, and had directly copied Eric Portman's stage performance.

Lancaster plays John Malcolm, who is engaged to Hiller's character Cooper. When his ex-wife shows up unexpectedly, he needs to deal with the intense feelings he still has for her. Cooper has to face it as well. Major Pollock has become friendly with the almost childlike Sibyl (Kerr) who is terrified of life; when his secret is revealed by Sibyl's mother, the effect on Sibyl is traumatic.These are all top-notch actors playing rich characters, but in the end, the most poignant performances belong to Niven and Kerr. Niven finally gets a chance in this film to prove his greatness as an actor, and his change from blustering braggart to timid man is awesome. His scene with Kerr as he attempts to explain himself is gut-wrenching. Kerr's Sibyl, who sees her one chance at happiness and independence from her mother fading away, gives a devastating performance. Those roles are flashier than the others; Wendy Hiller's strong and honest portrayal may not be as showy, but it is just as good. Lancaster, who coproduced, does a great job as the tormented Malcolm, who, despite their rotten marriage, can't help loving Ann (Hayworth), an aging beauty facing loneliness.Some characters in Separate Tables are resigned to their lives and have come to accept and enjoy the quiet solitude of the hotel; one couple, Charles and Jean (Taylor and Dalton) are in a transition, and this will take them out of the hotel and into a new life; Pat Cooper and Sibyl's mother, two very different women, face very different losses; and John, Ann, Major Pollock and Sibyl attempt to reach across their separate tables, take a risk and make a connection. And the assorted residents of the hotel, Lady Matheson (Nesbitt), Mr. Fowler (Aylmer) and Miss Meacham (May Hallatt) take a risk by being nonjudgmental and making a connection as well.A beautiful film that left this viewer reaching for the Kleenex. Separate Tables is about loneliness, reality vs. fantasy, hope and redemption. Don't miss it.

If you like acting at its finest, then this is one of the very best from the 1950s, having won two Academy Awards. And, of course, if you watch and like TV, then you'll be happy to know that that the director, Delbert Mann, did most of his work in that medium. This movie was one of Mann's uncommon forays into mainstream cinema in that decade, the other being Marty (1955) in which then newcomer Ernest Borgnine won his Academy Award.So, while it didn't get to TV until long after its release, the tight framing, confined setting, intelligent and sparkling dialog and economy of cuts and fades all add up to an experience much like a TV production quiet often, just two people are centred, mostly sitting, while the dialog dances between the two. So the action is quite static in that sense. But the real action, of course, is in the words as they spill from players' mouths, revealing the foibles, fabrications and fears of an almost permanent group of residents at a seaside hotel in the south of England.The weaknesses are predominantly shown in the almost manic dependence on the bottle by John Malcolm (Burt Lancaster) as he tries to forget his shattered marriage and love life; the lies sprout from nearly all of them, but particularly from Major Angus Pollock (David Niven, in a much deserved award winning role) who's trying to conceal his nasty side; and the fear shows up most in the neurotic character of Sybil Railton-Bell (Deborah Kerr) as she tries to free herself from her own insecurities and the clutches of her tyrannical mother, Mrs Railton-Bell (Gladys Cooper). All pretty heavy stuff for some, I suppose, but just the sort of stuff you'd expect from Terence Rattigan.A good contrast to the downbeat nature of the main players is the pair of young lovers, Charles (Rod Taylor) and Jean (Audrey Dalton) as they continually upset some of the older guests with their displays of kissing and cuddling; quite tame by today's standards of course, but just the sort of the thing designed to elicit acerbic comments from the likes of that old dragon, Mrs Railton-Bell. Some light comedy is provided by Miss Meacham (May Hallat), together with incisive comments to just about anybody who is present. Fittingly, she is the one who breaks the ice of silence that pervades the dining room in the final scene. It's so silent that, well...you could hear a serviette ring drop and &#150; guess what? &#150; you do!The only other main character, Ann Shankland (Rita Hayworth) is the bitchy ex-wife of John Malcolm, back to see him and to find out if she still has her power over him, the power to make him still love her. Trying to spoil that reunion is the hotel owner, Pat Cooper (Wendy Hiller, also an Oscar winner) who thinks that John Malcolm will marry her. Frankly, I think Ava Gardner would have been better in the role that Rita Hayworth managed to ruin with her vapid looks and insipid attempts at showing emotion; however, if that was the way she was told to play it, then I guess she succeeded...Shot in black and white, of course, you really take in the look and feel of the times, and if you've ever been to a seaside hotel in the south of England, you'll know what I mean. I recall a few, in the 1960s &#150; quiet, almost like a graveyard, dull gray skies, hushed tones, clock chimes and dinner bells. Oh, the ambiance...Highly recommended.

In other words -- real life.One of the most brilliant things about this film is how seamlessly the seemingly unconnected sub-plots meld together.This is not an exciting film, but it is brilliantly acted by just about all involved. And what a remarkable cast it is! Rita Hayworth is wonderful, and I realized that she is one actress I have payed little attention to; time to reassess!

Heavy on dialogue, the story reeks of 1950s melodrama. Clashes between characters, in this mixed gathering, provide the verbal conflict that moves the plot along. Most of the characters have assorted flaws and weaknesses, which play into the general theme of loneliness and isolation even when surrounded by other people.Casting and acting are important elements here. Gladys Cooper, Wendy Hiller, and David Niven are well cast and give fine performances. But Deborah Kerr is not convincing as a sheltered young woman. And Rita Hayworth comes across as stiff and out of place as a scheming sophisticate trying to manipulate her former husband. Other cast members in this ensemble story are adequate, if uninspiring.Originally a stage play, the entire story is set at the hotel. And most of the scenes are filmed indoors the hotel lobby, the dining room, a couple of bedrooms, on the terrace, and so on. The camera is very, very static. But the B&W lighting is effective. Sung by Vic Damone, the film's title song is truly doleful, and contributes to a general mood of loneliness in a setting of haughty sophisticates.Appealing probably more to adults than to kids, Separate Tables can be enjoyable if the viewer is in a melancholy or lonely mood. Technically, it's well made, for the most part. But it can also be boring and dull if the viewer doesn't identify with, or feel some bond toward, one or more of the characters.

It conveys his personal frustration of the conservative values which make-up English culture. Here in this film adaption of Separate Tables, Rattigan strives to communicate the underside of the English identity portrayed via a 'stiff upper lip',along with ideas and perceptions of morality, and authoritarianism.These aspects of conservatism, prominent within English culture are challenged by Rattigan via an eclectic bunch of character's juxtaposed against situations within the setting of a hotel which is particularly hospitable to waifs and strays from across the class spectrum. Although equals in so far they are all resident at the same hotel, their separate tables denote the class differences. Despie these class differences, it is in fact the differing situations of the four main characters which force's them to be introspective and by extension the hotel's guests, as well as the film's audience as a means of questioning their own morality as a contrived aspect of English culture.This is more explicit in David Niven's character Major Pollock where his advances towards women in cinema auditoriums are construed so immoral as to be illegal. This is a metaphor of homosexual behaviour for the gay author of Separate Table. As such Separate Tables is made personal for Rattigan where it permits him to challenge audience members who view homosexuality as immoral. This immoral perception of homosexuality was partly, and to an extent still is informed via its former illegal status within English law as illustrated within the time-frame of film's making - and by society which is quick to judge without questioning. As Major Pollock, Niven's character is made more complex by his inadequacies as a man identified by that of war heroism of the soldier which he portrays himself as being accomplished at via deceiving his fellow guests. This further hides Major Pollock's immorality, whilst questioning ideas of masculinity and what defines it. Within Niven's character, Rattigan defines masculinity as part and parcel of the English 'stiff upper lip'.Repression, is another characteristic of English culture as informed by the 'stiff upper lip' persona. It is the underside of this masculine cultural characteristic of Englishness which is conveyed adeptly via Deborah Kerr. Her character Silby's repression means that she is untrue to her own ideas and beliefs. These are kept firmly in check by Silby's Mother, (Gladys Cooper) who is a symbol of authoritarian conservative culture with bigoted Victorian values.This authoritarian dogma repressing the human condition within the person is illustrated as being like a recoiled spring which suddenly pings when pushed in too far. This is illustrated twofold. On the one hand it is illustrated via Silby finally plucking up enough courage to be insubordinate of her Mother's dogmatism at the conclusion of the film, and second via the perceived perversions of sexual groping, alcoholism and those who reject the conventions within marriage besides many more examples.The rejection of the conventions within marriage are represented by the character of Anne (Rita Heyworth), is particularly noteworthy. It is in fact Rattigan paying lip service to women's traditional roles and how through more independence they finally demand men to adhere to their needs as equals within heterosexual relationships.As to the acting in this film adaptation in Separate Tables, then it is almost incomparable. This is especially for David Niven who conveys the complexity of his character in Major Polock with great skill and aplomb by illustrating what his 'stiff upper lip' persona hides, how it deceives and its ultimate fallibility. His Oscar was well deserved in this instance. Moreover Major Polock illustrates to the audiences that Niven was an actor who brought depth to characters when given the opportunity. Debrorah Kerr's acting ability is a close runner up to that of Niven's in this film. As to Heyworth, she plays Anne with an intensity which makes her character seem tawdry for her insubordination of her ex-husband John, played by Burt Lancaster as a broken man. He seems bewildered as to why his ex-wife Anne can be so disrespectful of his methods of controlling her. (These methods of control were via domestic abuse where a man felt it was his right to assault an insubordinate wife). Such abuse has clearly lowered ex-wife Anne's esteem and as such she can't live apart from John. Meanwhile the supporting cast give competent performances which serve to enhance the acting abilities of the main characters. Kudos also goes to the film's director Delbert Mann for communicating to the audience the controversial issues originally addressed by Rattigan when he wrote the play.To conclude, this film adaptation of Separate Tables needs to be appreciated from the liberal perspective as almost a radical rejection of conservative morals by its frustrated gay author Terrance Rattigan. This he was able to accomplish due to the convergence of changing attitudes to morality.

The very occasional dashes of wit, all Burt Lancaster's, dry up early; after that, this is talk, talk talk, and the talk is all melodramatic drivel. Every man in this movie is a reasonably well-developed (which is not to say believable) character-- even Rod Taylor who only gets a few minutes of screen time. Meanwhile, every woman is reduced to a stock female, and invariably an unpleasant one neurotic prude (Deborah Kerr), harridan (Gladys Cooper), femme fatale (Rita Hayworth), nympho (Abby Dalton), and of course a bumper crop of spinsters (hetero Hiller, homo Hallett, indeterminate Nesbitt).It can't be called misogyny because this superficial view of women isn't hateful. It's just empty. Every scene is saturated with clichés, reducing an otherwise honorable idea for an ensemble piece to a dated, gynophobic, and boringly filmed melodrama. The playwright, Sir Terence Rattigan, clearly knows less about women than Moe Syzlak.

It is obvious why the director hated the lame vocals over the opening credits - very jarring in conjunction with the content and style of the film.Technically, the feature is excellent - great sets and costumes.

The metaphorical title refers to an item of decor, tables.  Although this film purports to be a heightened study of character, the true hero is the setting, the cramped interiors through which all the people pass, the bars that trap them not only in place, but in the lies and pretensions that help them struggle through life.We are introduced to a number of characters - Major Pollock, a retired officer full of military bluff (what what), whose 'shocking' behaviour at a cinema brings all the tensions at the Hotel to a head, as some of the boarders try to get him thrown out.  Sibyl is the young hysteric who loves him from afar, but who cows to her imperious mother, Mrs Railton-Bell, whose stifling respectability is the main agent of repression in the hotel.  John Malcolm is the whiskey-guzzling writer secretly in love with the hotel's owner, Pat Cooper, and whose ex-wife Ann Shankland comes to the hotel, a beautiful but aging model, still bearing the scars of Malcolm's jealous violence.  Mr. Fowler is a retired, implicitly homosexual classics master waiting Godot-like for an ex-pupil to visit.The film is based on two playlets by the master of the middle-class well-made play, Terrence Rattigan, and this is clearly evident not only in the claustrophobic single set, but in the emphasis on onion-like dialogue to reveal character and prompt action.  The theatrical form is apparent in the manner ensemble business gives way to a series of lengthy set-pieces, where two characters thrash out whatever has to be said; there is also an obvious three-act structure.Rattigan's style, considered old-fashioned today, determines a number of the film's features.  The characters all talk in clipped, stiff upper lip, plummy tones.  The single-set with all these emotionally traumatised characters is like a pressure cooker waiting to boil over, but when violence does eventually erupt, it is predictably the American who prompts it - such catharsis would simply not be British.More telling still is how Rattigan contains all these traumas in the way the house does.  Godlike, he is able to bring about resolution and reconciliation, strip away humbug and hypocrisy, let essentially decent people begin again.  Unlike many Hollywood films, or British well-made plays, mistakes are not fatal, they can be forgiven.  The neatness of the form accomodates this - once the central crises have been outlined, events proceed predictably, because these are predictable lives.It would be an injustice to Rattigan to deny his anger, and from his own position as a repressed homosexual (still illegal in Britain at the time the film was made), he can portray lives paralysed by the need to live up to certain (usually self-generated) expectations.  The use of the hotel to dramatise different types might lead one to suspect the film is a kind of allegory, that the hotel is England, but it's not an England many people in 1958 would have recognised - we really are watching relics in a museum. Even the daring young couple seem very quaint.In a film where the director goes out of his way to serve the static material, the burden of interest must fall on the cast.  And what an amazing cast it is - Burt Lancaster, Rita Hayworth, Deborah Kerr, Wendy Hiller, Gladys Cooper, David Niven.  It's not that they do anything wrong, but they are hampered by the fact that their parts are both hackneyed and unrealistic; they play them well, but to see emotion bubbling in a rigid surface, there are better films elsewhere.  Niven is one of my beloved actors, and he's very good here, but, Oscar or not, he fudges his big scene with Kerr by rattling off his lines mechanically.  His closing scene at breakfast is much better.It's hard to fault a film that does what it sets out to achieve with thorough success,  it's just the kind of respectable, bourgeois, evasive entertainment that makes me want to, if I may say so under IMDb guidelines, SCREAM.

Director Mann worked mostly in television and it shows, looking like a filmed television play. The acting is stagy, the dialog is pretentious, and the characters are not well-developed. Under Mann's heavy hand, the actors generally overact, specially Kerr as a mousy spinster; Hiller comes off the best as the proprietor of the hotel. It has serious drama stamped all over it and there is not a sliver of comic relief. It's not terrible but, given the stars involved, the film is disappointing. How did Niven win a Best Actor Oscar for this? He has a supporting role and he's not very good.

Profound? No. Entertaining? For the most part. Separate Tables is what results when you mix Peyton Place and Clue. Everyone's a suspect for Most Noble Sufferer, and mostly the cast does well with the material given, even if in many cases the material doesn't deserve the quality of the actors delivering it. Inevitably, some of the stories are more interesting than the others. The Burt Lancaster/Rita Hayworth love-hate plot line grew tiresome in record pace---and too bad, since obviously this is the story the screenwriter and director were most taken with. It definitely dominates.I wanted more of the Deborah Kerr/Gladys Cooper storyline. Deborah Kerr is a bizarre woman-child, unrecognizable in frump garb, dominated by her overbearing mother, Gladys Cooper doing her withering old biddie routine for the umpteenth time. Cooper is a riot, an old lady with WAY too much time on her hands, eager to go witch-hunting at every available opportunity.Poor David Niven is saddled with the role of a lonely British man pretending to be something he's not and trying to hide an embarrassing secret from the group. He wanders around in a smoking jacket doing his best Colonel Mustard impersonation, saying things like Wot, wot and mumbling lines to the point of unintelligibility. He inexplicably won a Best Actor Oscar for his performance (must have been a weak year), no doubt more for his body of work up to that point than for this performance specifically. He has maybe 20 minutes of screen time altogether and for most of them is required to do nothing more than look uncomfortable.The best cast member is Wendy Hiller, playing the proprietress of the hotel. Her acting is natural and low-key, and she gets the chance to play a fully rounded character, one with some implied history, and not merely an assemblage of mannerisms.The end of the film is a like a stuffy version of Dead Poets Society. I would have given anything to see Deborah Kerr jump onto a table and start clapping, but I guess these guests are a bit too reserved for that sort of thing, wot, wot.Grade C+ "}{"Title":"give me a table for one - waayy over there, please","Date":"25 February 2002","Score":"0 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  Agnst and emotional turmoil at a British seaside guest house, andain't it surprising how many Yanks were on the premises?
