He is just supposed to be used to train police but he escapes from his virtual reality to the reality. That sounds pretty interesting and this premise could be taken into many different directions especially since he is such a complex character you could go so many different way going about to make this film. Though this movie did not take the worst direction it did not take the best one. This movie went for pure action and no real drama or meaningful message. Now that is OK but it lacked in doing this because of the The directing which was average by Brett Leonard. He made this into a very exciting TV movie which it is not. He had two very talented actors in Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe yet he was not able to generate the excitement and fast pace feeling that is needed to make a good action movie.The writing is also at fault too. The writing was not great here. It seemed to have a lot of overused themes such as the cop trying to retain the high status that he used too have and also the idiot cops getting in the way. That is also OK but the dialog made this interesting idea into a movie that was not so unfamiliar. Not much originality in here despite having such a unique character. That is always the script's fault whenever this happens. The writing and directing just made this movie so frustrating to watch.You cannot blame the acting. You could see that Denzel Washington, already an established actor at that time, and Russell Crowe, not established, really tried to push this movie forward. Yet there was little to work with which made them look really average.This movie could have been much better if it was made more into a action/drama about the our inner battles. Considering that SID 6.7 had 150 personalities the storyline of his character could have made him have a battle within himself. Now this was done to a minor level which really annoyed me. They are many other ideas or methods that could have really made this movie something but of course this did not happen. It went for cheap effects, an over used clichéd storyline with a little bit of a twist.

If you saw The Matrix(99) and were wondering where you glimpsed the VR scenery years earlier, it may have been in this pic. Here, Denzel gets to briefly run around inside a VR world, chasing after virtual killer Russell Crowe, known as Sid 6.7 (very close to 6.66, isn't it?). Sid 6.7 is the latest computer program, a conglomeration of about 200 serial killers & mass murderers, and so advanced it's virtually self-aware. The bulk of the picture takes place in the real world, to which Sid 6.7 manages to escape to with the help of very advanced nanotechnology. I believe this was supposed to take place slightly in the future (1999), but from our perspective, it's old hat and square. Everything looks outmoded and just old, except the strangely hi-tech VR and nanites.It's also interesting, from the modern perspective, to view an early role of Crowe's, before he hit the A-List. He doesn't have much to play with here. His character doesn't have the luxury of falling back on deep psychological reasons for his murderous ways, because he's inhuman. He's simply the latest software given locomotion in the semblance of a human body. He's programmed to be the way he is - there's no choice involved on his part. There's a brief mention of his program evolving once in the real world, but there's no actual evidence of that. Once in the real world, it's a simplistic chase & destroy mission, with Denzel the only one in the city trained to stop him. Denzel, just getting on the A-List a couple of years earlier, is standard action hero here, driven by a brutal tragedy from before the film begins. The motivations for a couple of key supporting characters are suspect; the designer of Sid 6.7, for example, turns out to be almost as psychotic, but it's hard to believe no one noticed this before (was he influenced by the software?). Fichtner, as a government aide, has the most thankless role, as an idiotic bureaucrat. The child actress playing the daughter of Lynch's character went on to teenage bombshell roles in TV series, the latest being Charmed.

Hollywood's always been a midwife for technology between the science industry and the common man, and in the area of virtual reality it's given us Johhny Mnemonic and this actioner, starring Denzel Washington.Basic plot is this The police have been using virtual reality as a training method, to test recruits. Before they use it on real cops, though, they draft crooks out of prison to act as guinea pigs. This is where Washington comes in. A former cop (how convenient), Washington's been rotting in jail for years. So the cops ask him to volunteer to be a part of the experiment, and of course he agrees - but the computer he's going to be downloaded into has other plans. The 'virtual' cops are supposed to face this tough criminal in the system, you see, but the computer's decided to combine all of the nasty characteristics of famous real-life killers - and then download itself into a real, sentient being (Russell Crowe). And of course it's up to our man Washington to save the day.So there you have it, folks. It's a standard cops n robbers plot moved ahead a few centuries to take advantage of modern technology. Of course, it's set in the future, which here is portrayed as busy, grimy, a bit crime-riddled.. Hmm, a lot like the present, come to think of it, and not very inventive. And the effects are nothing special, either; you'd think with virtual reality being the centerpiece you'd see some dazzling special effects. Not really. The cast is good, and Crowe turns in a solid (if a bit hammy, but most bad guys are, aren't they?) performance. Washington is no better or worse than usual, which means the real culprit is the script here. Do yourself a favor and wait for a two-for-one night at your video store to see this one.

The cast is eclectic, with the powerful Russell Crowe as the virtual bad guy, a two dimensional creature bent on death and destruction, and Crowe brings a frightening believability to the role.

The director of such a film as The Lawnmower Man didn't really make anything of note since this film Virtuosity (unless one counts Highlander 5 The Source to be of actual quality which is hard to argue for), but there was a time when he knew where to put the camera and shoot as far as action and competency with his actors. The plot of Virtuosity is cut out of other movies to be sure, and would be again (one may be reminded of 12 Monkeys with its convicted man put on a mission by his captors, or even by Batman with its anti-hero and psychotic villain creating chaos all over the city), but, perhaps if only in retrospect, the movies carries some solid entertainment in the near-mindless tradition of loud, stupid Hollywood science fiction movies of the 90's. It's like John Woo lite.There isn't much to the plot except that a former detective (Washington) in prison for killing a man, and a few others, one of whom responsible for the death of his wife and daughter, is put into a virtual reality simulation against a psychotic being (Crowe), who is let into the real world by an asswipe who wants to get back at his bosses or something, and now the mano-a-mano is on in the real world (and, another former movie reference, Escape from NY finish the mission, get a full pardon, but don't mind the chip in your head that might kill you). The plot is cookie cutter, and there is lack of motivation to some of the action until the over the top climax comes around. But within the silly context of things, it does make sense. And for those who may be tired of the super-fast action cutting of today's product (Bourne, Transformers, Expendables), it is a relief to be able to see what's going on.Will it be amazing for everyone? Probably not. It does have generic plotting and the very end is close to a cop-out. But one big factor in my enjoyment of Virtuosity, on top of the decent action, were the stars, Washington and especially Crowe. The latter gives a performance that is surprising considering where he went to for the rest of his Hollywood career. This is an actor with a lot to prove, and it's ironic considering Crowe is having more diabolical fun as a Terminator-cum-Joker than he has had in most other more serious action oriented roles. Sometimes his mannerisms make the stakes a little crazier, or simply the way he acts across from stoic and concerned Washington that makes it work so. Strange as it might seem, it's really one of Crowe's finest performances, true to the wonky nature of the character and just wicked fun. It's like Crowe's imitation of a Rutger Hauer performance, which is a sight to see on its own.Certainly it's no masterpiece, but Virtuosity has its charms and moments of excitement. It's likely the highpoint of Leonard's career, which may not be saying much, but putting together cool virtual reality sequences (the opening is most thrilling) and two high-caliber stars makes for some fun Saturday afternoon viewing.

For me, however, there aren't enough excellent films out there to justify wasting such potential as this. I mean, really, if this was handled at least a little better, it could truly provide food for thought and provoke, especially if the mainstream approach of this was kept somewhat intact.

The story is that a hostile computer program (Sid 6.7) has escaped cyberspace and has assumed human form and an incarcerated cop (Barnes) is the only person who can stop him.  Sid 6.7 craves media attention, as he is the composite of 183+ serial killers including Adolf Hitler, Charles Manson, and the man who murdered Parker's wife and daughter.  Sid constantly uses taunts to try to get Parker to slip up and leaves a trail of dead bodies as well.  The protagonist is played much like any other, he's vulnerable and is determined to stop the villain.  The antagonist is like any classic villain, completely over-the-top and only exists to be beaten.  However, Sid is not like most video game villains.  Sid is nearly invincible because he is not human, but a machine.  In addition to that, he can regenerate his injuries by using the silicon properties of glass.  This proves to be quite a challenge for Parker as it makes defeating Sid very difficult.  In the end, this advantage is also Sid's only weakness the larger his injuries, the longer time it will take to regenerate and the easier it is for him to be defeated.Now some people may view Virtuosity to be, at best, ultra-violent entertainment, which it is not.  This film is actually a lot more than that.  What Virtuosity is trying to show us, is how truly f****d up our society has or will become.  The best example of this is during the Death T.V. scene when Sid 6.7 holds a television studio hostage.  During this scene, the camera makes numerous cuts to computer screens that are showing the television ratings.  Note that when Sid 6.7 first takes over the studio, that the very low ratings suddenly skyrocket.  From this evidence, one can only conclude that our society thrives on violence.  In this case, Sid is not the real villain here.  All Sid is doing, is giving us what we want, but can never get, which is violence in all its purity and unrestrained quality.

SID overloads the system and kills Donovan. Police Commissioner Elizabeth Deane (Louise Fletcher) orders the program shut down. Instead programmer Lindenmeyer tricks Clyde Reilly to download SID into a nano-machine body. With SID being free in the real world, the Commissioner offers Barnes a full pardon to bring SID back to virtual reality with the help of criminal psychologist Dr. Madison Carter (Kelly Lynch).I really love the ideas in this movie. I love the serial killer program, the virtual reality and the nanotech body. Russell Crowe is bringing a lot murderous glee into the character. I don't like the style of the computer program look. The whole movie could use a bit less of the stylized colored look. It was campy even back then. The movie is deliberately trying to be that 90s computer blocky look. I do really love the serial killer from Crowe and Washington as the dark hero. There's also an unrecognizable girl Kaley Cuoco as Carter's daughter. The brutality is relentless which doesn't wear out mostly because of the two great leads. It would have worked better with a darker look which would fit the subject better.

It deals with one of the best villain created in movies, even more interesting than Terminator (1984) which was a machine-created cyborg, while SID 6.7 comes from a human programmer whose creature is about to be destroyed. Furthermore SID is capable of self upgrading a very fun moment is when SID understands where he needs to go in order to achieve the widest audience. There are other weak points along the plot. It is not clear the reason why only Parker can chase SID 6.7 and why the SWAT officers chases him instead of the killer.

The creator gets the bright idea of making him human and releasing him into the real world, then runs away and goes into hiding in a motel after Sid kills the person he first sees in front of him. The logic behind the creator's thinking was at best less than absolute. So they grab Parker Barnes (Washington), who has been working with the program for sometime, to track down the program and bring him, it, whatever back to the virtual world.The movie has its ups and downs, but after watching it, I don't think this is a movie that can be taken seriously. Denzel took the part merely because his son asked him to do so and Crowe was still the incubation stage of his career. Washington's performance was weak, but Crowe's was solid, he made a good believable psychopath, Crowe took the character for what it was a worked with it.

No wonder he's so sought after these days.Though SID is maniacal, he draws you in as you just want to see what he'll do next. The symphony of screams was brilliantly psychotic. SID's absolute menace makes you either hate him or love him for his sly evil.Denzel Washington does an always solid job as the opposite of SID.

Denzel Washington stars in apretty thankless role as Parker Barnes, a vengeance-ridden cop who has to stop a vicious killer named Sid (a deliciously over-the-top Russell Crowe). But there's a twist that helps this seemingly-formulaic cop vehicle out of the cliche pitt Sid isn't human, but a computer- generated creation made for human likeness, and fitted with 200 person- alities of the most notorious criminals imaginable (Hitler, Charles Manson, and John Wayne Gacy are among the list). A discriminating viewer would totally dismiss VIRTUOSITY for it'sflamboyant view of violence (when they explain that Sid is a crazed killer, they weren't kidding!). Plus, one can't help but wonder why Denzel Washington, the star of fine films such as MALCOLM X, MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING, and the intelligent cop drama TRAINING DAY would ever end up in a silly macho popcorn flick such as this one? Despite that, however, Washington tries his hardest keeping his tongue firmly incheek. He even has a scene where he himself goes postal on a baddie, which strongly parallels his hardened cop character from TRAINING DAY. But the film's real winners go to Russell Crowe and its creativeout-of-the-ordinary premise. Crowe has a field day playing the maniacal Sid (a totally different character transition as oppose to his more brooding and silent roles such as Maximus from GLADIATOR and Budfrom L.A. CONFIDENTIAL). Plus the new approach of making the killer a creation of Virtual Reality is quite ingenious; in that way,artificial intelligence is jacked to the max, and the villain isn't human but a machine, much like the Terminator but with more feelings. It's almost like fighting a bloodthirsty Max Headroom.

He brings such unabandoned joy to the role that you are liable to root for SID all the way to the end. I found myself cheering every time he cleared out another room of unlucky bystanders. But the film doesn't let you get away with cheap thrills--there is a scene where SID says I am what I am because of what you are, and this, along with other sentiments expressed in the film, tells the viewer that she has allowed herself to become no better than the bad guy. The film brings you to question your own enjoyment of it, forcing you into the nasty role of voyeur. What makes this film _sexy_ is the homoeroticism. Few other action films embrace homoerotica as lustily as this one does--it's subtle, yet bold. Short of the Batman films, this may be the most homoerotic action film I can think of. There are two main homoerotic relationships--the one between SID and his pursuer, Parker Barnes, and the one between SID and his creator, Darrel Lindenmeyer. These bonds anchor the film--they are the reason why SID is so fixated on Parker, and why Lindenmeyer risks everything to bring SID into the real world. It is an incredibly brilliant and ballsy plot device for writer and director to have used, and it causes some of the films more tender and hilarious moments. If you keep an eye out for it, you will love it. I have seen this film at least forty or so times now--I've lost count. It is absolutely my favorite movie, and if I hadn't purchased it, I would have rented myself out of house and home, by now. It is also the film that introduced me to the brilliant Russell Ira Crowe.

He dealt with virtual reality in the astonishingly awful Lawnmower Man. This time, the special effects are more elaborate and successful but they are not state-of-art, even for a 1995 movie. The plot is also ordinary how many times has a special man been sent to stop an almost unkillable murderer. However there are two twists to the formula the first one is that the killer is a virtual killer, the second one is that he is played by Russell Crowe.In 1995, Russell was virtually unknown. Right now, he is one of the most important actors in Hollywood, next to Mel Gibson, Kevin Spacey and his co-star from this movie, Denzel Washinton. What makes Russell an unusual choice for this role is that beside being incredibly good-looking (all that his Sid 6.7 would have needed), he is also tremendously talented (look at his Oscar nomination for The Insider). But it is his talent that gives Sid 6.7 life. He plays his character with a complete over-the-top flamboyance, which makes him even more interesting that Denzel Washington. Russell has a lot of fun in creating Sid.The other performers mediocre or bland. Denzel Washington is boring as the hero, and the usually impressive Louise Fletcher is completely forgettable as L.A.'s Attorney General. A huge mistake was Kelly Linch. Her character doesn't do anything important, except just to be in the way of the two main characters. She is indeed the mother of the little girl, that Sid uses ultimately in trying to kill Parker Barnes (played by Washington). But it could have been any little girl. Linch gets so little character development that we couldn't care less for her.Overall, the movie is entertaining, but only because of Russell Crowe. 7/10.

VIRTUOSITY has some of the most painfully predictable plot elements to come out of any theatrical release of the 1990s. Denzel Washington's Parker Barnes, hired to track down a virtual villain let loose in the real world, is, surprise, himself an ex-cop. The villain in question, Russell Crowe's SID 6.7, is a composite of dozens of murderers, including, surprise, the killer of Barnes' wife and daughter. And you just know as soon as you see the young daughter of Barnes' sidekick that he'll have to save her from a diabolical plot concocted by SID (which he does). Moreover, the special effects are surprisingly straight-to-DVD-like, even by 1995 standards. And Crowe's over-the-top bad guy is just too much at times, though perhaps that was the point.But there are some good things to be said about VIRTUOSITY. Washington's performance is nearly the saving grace the film needs, even though our star sometimes seems to be asking the same question as the audience What is he doing in a picture like this? VIRTUOSITY also has a fun cat-and-mouse quality, and despite some absurdities and aforementioned clichés, the imaginative storyline sporadically catches our imagination. If nothing else, it certainly marks a departure for Washington, who has played the good cop countless times in his career. Director Brett Leonard keeps things moving at a reasonable pace, though the film sometimes feels a bit too much like THE LAWNMOWER MAN, his highly disappointing entry from three years prior.VIRTUOSITY is not a completely lost cause, but it is stunningly average considering the talent involved. Sci-fi fans will probably appreciate it more than most.

Of course, such films these days look astonishingly old fashioned and about as realistic as someone in the mid-90's watching repeats of Star Trek. This film, starring two of Hollywood's future A-list, initially feels like a bit of a laugh but beneath the surface, there's actually an intelligent script trying to get out. A pity then that it's buried in a middling sci-fi shooter that fails to live up to its initial promise. For all the fancy CG and cyber-punk aspirations, it is a film which is actually quite old fashioned.A company specialising in virtual-reality training for law enforcement officers has been testing the system, pitting guinea-pig convicts against their uber-criminal SID 6.7 (Russell Crowe). After one such convict, disgraced former cop Parker Barnes (Denzel Washington), almost takes SID 6.7 down, the program is terminated after his partner is killed in real-life after his neural network becomes overloaded. But thanks to shady technician Lindenmeyer (Stephen Spinella), SID 6.7 soon crosses over from the virtual world into the real world and undergoes a massive killing spree. The overwhelmed police, led by Barnes' former colleague William Cochran (William Forsythe), have no choice but to spring Barnes from prison in an attempt to bring SID 6.7 in for real. Tagging along for the ride is criminal psychologist Madison Carter (Kelly Lynch) who uncovers something rather disturbing in SID 6.7's programming...On the face of it, Virtuosity seems like a big dumb piece of poorly-conceived cyber-nonsense and at times, it's hard to disagree. Take the scene in the nightclub when SID 6.7 starts conducting his audience of terrified hostages to scream and whimper on cue. If you're carrying the personalities of over 200 murderers and mass murderers, I'm not sure this is the first thing I'd do if I were free to roam the land. The whole thing felt like needless filler and the dated-futurism also felt old-fashioned and migraine-inducing. Crowe's exuberance is well-suited to the sharply dressed psychopathic computer program while Washington's performance seems to ebb away once he's a regular cop again. Lynch has almost nothing to do besides look pretty and provide something for our hero to protect. And the story about the one good guy who can take down the brilliant baddie is as archaic as the Old Testament. But... there is something strangely enjoyable about the film. Maybe it's the subtle hints that both hero and villain are characters in a game, destined to duel each other until the final climatic battle (which happens to take place atop a skyscraper, naturally!).It should be garbage but Virtuosity is a surprisingly competent film, despite the screenplay and dubious quality of the effects. SID 6.7 is one of the most charismatic baddies you're likely to see outside a Bond film and his unique cyber-space body (complete with blue blood and a constant need to replace the silicon in his body, forcing him to eat glass) makes him memorable, certainly more so than Barnes. And while the screenplay has an abundance of ideas, it can't string them together well enough to explain everything - Lindenmeyer's role as the saboteur was lost on me, I'm afraid. But in spite of its flaws, it's a difficult movie to condemn. It wants to entertain you, pleading for you to ignore the chunky CG and go along with it. And because it's hard to dislike Denzel and fun to cheer for Crowe, you largely do.

The ending and ticking time bomb is just a little too long and slows the momentum a bit, but til then, strap on your seat belt, put on your VR glasses, and prepare to be taken for a ride.

Some of the cinematography is nice to look at but the film itself feels like a made-for-TV cheap a** sci-fi flick; the kind you see on Cinemax or the Sy-Fy channel. Admittedly, I enjoyed Russel Crowe's performance as he has some of the best one-liners in the film but with such a below average script and action, the experience is that of dullness, uninspired, trite and true film making that would make Ed Wood proud to this day(if he were alive that is).I tried to like it. Really I did. I just felt really disappointed that the premise, interesting as it is, wasn't fully realized to it's full potential and speaking of premises, if I had to choose between this and Demolition Man, I'd say do yourself a favor and see that film instead. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but it's a far more entertaining(and funny) action-packed film with a much better premise(though not as original as it may be)than this one.But hey, at least we have The Book of Eli and Denzel is in that one which I have yet to see.

Although I have documented and tried to copyright my own ideas. Virusoity seems to be similar to the movie the Matrix were the imagination and reality get mixed together. Of course if you really think you can jump off a building and live then I am sure Sir Issac Newton may prove you wrong. But if you believe in persons with higher intelligences or persons with intellectual abilities superior than most people then its wise to listen to wise counsel. The plot of Virusoity is that total lack of compassion, the pure logic and use of logic for power. What makes this interesting is Russel Crowe's character polarization towards the use of fear, which is emotion and contrary to the movie plot theory using only logic and power of that logic. It becomes a logic of existence, like a True False statement and the silicone android does not like the statement of True. So the plot goes beyond the technology and adds emotions to Russel Crowe's character. What does this say about the balance of power in global economics, technologies, defense strategy, etc... that depend on intellectual property rights?

Virtuosity takes place some time in the future, when virtual reality is more advanced, such that a character can assume a personality, even begin to change itself, however all safely locked away in a virtual environment. That is, until two experimenters collaborate, and a virtual reality chip is put into a machine that synthesizes a life-like android. One that looks just like Russell Crowe comes out, naked, and equipped with features of over 200 real, notorious men, most master criminals. Something like this on the loose is very dangerous, and in fact begins to kill for sheer pleasure. The only man thought to be able to find and defeat this android is an imprisoned cop, played by Denzel Washington. And that is the story, the movie, to see which of these two will emerge victorious. Interesting premise, but at times it become so loaded with the baggage of intricate chase scenes, with all the cliché's we've seen before, that it becomes just another ordinary movie. However, Russell Crowe shows what a fine actor he already was, before he hit fame!SPOILERS follow, please read no further, OK!? The android is made of a process based on silica, so any time it gets a hand or foot blown off by a powerful gun, all it has to do is touch glass and it mends in a matter of seconds. They chase each other, the android kidnaps a young daughter of the pretty psychologist working with Denzel, ties her up with a bomb and detonation device. Denzel finds her, but has to defeat a computer program to do so, and he does just barely, with seconds remaining, of course. (Don't they always??) Then, in a fight the android falls through glass, badly injuring itself, and while it is being repaired Denzel reaches into the damaged head to extract the virtual reality chip, and when Crowe's character reaches awareness again, he is back into the virtual reality mode, and everyone is safe.

Louise Fletcher is good with what she had to do. Kaley Cuoco is very good here, and was cool to see her as a young child, she is GORGEOUS now!, but she did what she had to do well, and was very likable.

But even big stars are not immune from taking the attitude that they always must be working in order to make a buck. That's basically what happened here with their decision to be a part of this hopeless enterprise known as 'Virtuosity'.Set in a futuristic Los Angeles, Denzel Washington plays former police Lt. Parker Barnes, imprisoned for life after murdering a terrorist who kidnapped his wife and child. It seems during his failed attempt to rescue his family, not only does he kill Grimes and his associates but a pair of newsmen covering the story. Barnes is called upon (along with another inmate), to test out the Law Enforcement Technology Advancement Center's (LETAC) new virtual reality program, designed to improve officer's tracking skills by hunting down SID 6.7 (played by a one-note Russell Crowe), a virtual reality entity whose personality is a composite of the 200 worst criminals in history. During the test, SID figures out how to raise the sensitivity calibrations in the virtual reality program, which ends up killing one of the inmates who's been participating in the program test.As a result, the Commissioner in charge of the program wants to shut it down but the program's originator tricks his brainy co-worker into turning SID into a real-world regenerating android (similar to the android in Terminator II). SID then escapes and is determined to murder as many people as possible in the real world. Barnes, who proved his mettle during his virtual reality encounter with SID, is now given a chance to earn his freedom by tracking the sadistic criminal down and eliminating him. He's joined by Dr. Madison Carter, a psychiatrist, who acts as a consultant to LETAC.The bulk of the movie involves Barnes chasing SID in various venues in Los Angeles. In contrast to Terminator II, where Arnold Schwarznegger used a high powered shotgun to create large bullet holes in the android he's trying to subdue, Barnes shoots SID with an ordinary handgun, resulting in less dramatic smaller holes that regenerate every time SID is shot. I guess Virtuosity's budget wasn't as big as Terminator II.It appears that SID can really kill Barnes anytime he feels like it and at one point he frees him from a locked armored car as Barnes is being transported back to prison. We're told that SID does this because he simply enjoys the sport of Barnes chasing him. But if Barnes is SID's main impediment to creating more mayhem in the city, why doesn't SID dispatch Barnes right away? Obviously, you wouldn't have much of a movie left if Barnes is eliminated too soon.Finally, Dr. Carter leaves her daughter 'home alone' which allows SID to conveniently kidnap her and threaten to kill the child on national TV. Barnes tracks SID down at the TV station and continues to fire bullets at him that only temporarily impede his movements. Eventually, Barnes has a face-to-face fistfight with SID on top of a high-rise. Despite the fact that SID has superhuman strength and could probably kill Barnes with one blow, their confrontation lasts a couple of minutes, eventually leading to SID's demise as he falls through a glass ceiling and is impaled on shards of glass. As he is about to regenerate, Barnes takes the crystal software program from the back of SID's head which effectively shuts him down. Using the crystal, Barnes tricks SID into revealing the location of Dr. Madison's kidnapped daughter inside the virtual reality world, and then saves the little girl. End of movie.What could have been a fascinating journey through a virtual reality dream-like world, turns into an ordinary cop-criminal encounter featuring a series of dull chase scenes, once SID becomes a real-life android. The similarities between Virtuosity and Terminator II are obvious but the latter movie has much more class. Yes, Virtuosity does have a 'plot' but it's much more laughable than suspenseful. Denzel and Russell Crowe do collect their paychecks but really should be embarrassed to have been part of this vapid, cheesy production.

Even when I was little, I was TOTALLY fascinated and enthralled with the television series 'WILD, WILD WEST'. I just loved all the neat, creative devices they came up with. I also really liked this director's other film 'LAWNMOWER MAN' a lot too (mainly because I really liked the actors, I think) And, I feel that for the Genre, this film here is quite good. Denzel is excellent as usual and the supporting actors do a fine job. Prior to seeing this, I wasn't aware that Russell Crowe was the bad guy. He is delightfully Evil (if maybe a BIT hammy at times) and has kind of an infectious charisma that is hard not to like. He comes across with a nice balance of being both childlike and Evil.If you like this kind of Cyberpunk Science Fiction, this movie is actually quite entertaining. I cannot for the life of me see why this director after doing both 'LAWNMOWER MAN' and this film, suddenly seemed to drop off the face of the earth. Very sad... I think he had some real talent, and it would have been interesting to see what other films he might have made along these linesI feel that some of the negative reviews are probably due to people who perhaps do not like these kinds of films to begin with. I mean, NO..., it is not 'BLADERUNNER' or 'THX-1138' or '2001', that is true. But, for this TYPE of Science Fiction film, I felt that it was imaginative and fun and well above average compared to many other similar movies out there. I personally liked this film better than JOHNNY MNEMONIC' although that also was a very entertaining film. But, I found this one to be more involving and the characters (AND the acting) to be quite a bit better. The STORY of 'JOHNNY MNEMONIC' is a lot better, but the acting and characters of this film are better. Some other strong points of this film is it's good pacing along with some decent effects (for the time) and, like I had mentioned, Russell Crowe as the bad guy is pretty entertaining, although at times, also quite chilling.So, I think what you have to consider if you are trying to determine whether you want to spend your time watching this or not, is whether you like this TYPE of Science Fiction. There are SO MANY different kinds of Sci Fi, that it's impossible to group them all together and make a single judgment on the Genre as a whole. Different types can be EXTREMELY divergent. You can have films that are more Psychological or Cerebral like 'PRIMER' or 'PREDESTINATION' (Yes, I am editing this review some time later ) or fun, lighter ones like this one, or some that are like 'TERMINATOR' or 'ALIENS', or you can have really dark Horror Sci Fi like the excellent 'HARDWARE', or Sci Fi films that are much more heavily weighted toward social issues or character studies. Some are quite densely structured like 'DUNE' (the book more so than the movie, although I LOVE Lynch's film) and then you have light, kind of silly ones. So, there are a LOT of very different kinds. But, IF you do like THIS kind of fun, imaginative, and entertaining Science Fiction and can just sit back and enjoy it, there may be a good chance that you might like this film like I did. And, Denzel is almost ALWAYS very good...It is Oscar material? No... Is it a lot of fun? HELL yeah!

His character is just to tragic to be in a movie that should be more about fun and shocking things. Not things associated with a serious drama or a type of movie of that sort. Sid played by Russell Crowe is the type of character you expect in this type of movie and gives the movie some spice which helps it from being a completely terrible movie and waste of time. Still, the ending was so bad that it took even that slightest potential and threw it in the garbage. The story has Parker as a cop with a past helping to test a virtual reality machine that is supposed to help police officers train and such. I will not say what the past part is, but the character of Parker is in prison now for said past. Well the program that they use to test is a bit to good and ends up killing one guy who is also a convict and the debate about the machine rages and some want to shut it down. However, somehow Sid (the program) escapes the virtual world with the aid of one rather demented guy and goes on the rampage, Parker is released from prison as he is the only one who has come close to catching Sid in the virtual world. So he is off and you have your various chase scenes and such and the movie is a bit like Demolition Man but not nearly as entertaining.

He tries to turnthis into more than an action film, but his character is just notthere.Brett Leonard, of The Lawnmower Man and the bad Hideaway,finally finds another movie to use his trademark computer specialeffects in. The effects are okay, but are constantly undermined anddrowned out by all the bloodshed. The screenwriter makes badplot decisions just so he can move his story along, not becausethey make sense. SID's programmer releases SID because he ismad. SID can regenerate himself with glass, SID is not reallydrawn to any of the other real life killers he has been programmedwith, just the one Washington has flashbacks about. I thought SIDwould be like a superhuman serial killer, leaving other real lifekillers' clues in his path, but we get a passing Charles Mansonmention, and that is it.There is more broken glass in this film than Another 48 HRS, theprevious broken glass champion. Some fun almost comes in theclimax, as Washington pursues SID, and in turn is pursued by thecops for a crime SID framed him for. The film is also ten minutestoo long, as we must sit through the rescue of Lynch's daughter,which feels tacked on to the end.Yes, the computer effects are pretty good. Crowe, not my favoriteactor, is as good as he can be considering the script. Once again,Leonard just does not build any momentum in his direction. Hiscamera is everywhere, but he wastes his talents on a screenplaythat lumbers toward inevitability in every scene.In the climax, as SID takes over a TV broadcast to kill on the air, wesee the viewer ship increase. There is nothing worse than amedium telling me how awful another medium is. I do not need aviolent film to tell me there is too much violence on TV and theinternet. That would be like a porn actress telling me women areused as sexual objects in strip clubs.Take away all the bells and whistles (and carnage and  explosions), and you have a really average film dressed up with agood cast. I cannot recommend it.This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, very strong gunviolence, profanity, brief female nudity, some male nudity, sexualreferences, and adult situations.

I asked the person I went with what I had missed and learned it was really nothing I had missed at all.Denzel Washtingon can act just the direction and script he was given was sorely lacking, though if you liked this move then you will need to see the Joan Collin's version of Empire of the Ants.Supposedly to be so advance with technology the effects are bad and very unbelievable. 1977 Star Wars (IV A New Hope) has better effects than this.Not worth the time.

Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington are both good in this movie, Crowe as a jolly killer and Washington as the jaded cop. The problem is their characters are underwritten as is everyone else's characters and the plot. To make up for this, the director uses his training from The Lawnmover Man to create some interesting images in an attempt to keep our minds from the plot with the help of cheap effects. The result is something that is so cold you won't care about it, a mindless creation of glitter and film without a soul. The concept is enough to make the movie watchable once and the names(Sid 6.7 and Parker Barnes) are kinda cool. The ending ruins what could have at least been a passable effort. Kelly Lynch needs to needs to stop taking roles that make her look prissy and frumpy. Her turn on The L Word showed a great actress who looks really hot which are characteristics that should be displayed more in an individual. Williams Fichtner and Forsythe help this mess in small roles.

And it isn't just because the feeble people of Australia want to claim Russell as one of theirs in spite of the fact that he is closely related to a former New Zealand cricket hero. He quite sincerely steals the entire show in spite of playing one of the most unidimensional bad guys in the history of theatre.Denzel Washington and Kelly Lynch are left in the dust because they sensed a less than perfect script and obviously decided to deliver I'm here, now where's my paycheck? type performances. That, more than anything else, is what doomed the film the fact that the hero and the romantic interest just didn't give a rat's about their roles. Crowe, on the other hand, was still mostly an unknown at the time in spite of a few awards from the Australian Film Industry. This resulted in him treating every American role he was given at the time as if it would be his last, and the results speak for themselves. Since SID has no emotions or personality to speak of, playing him would have left a myriad of possibilities to explore. The result of Crowe's intrepetation of the script leaves us with a similar villian to that played by Kevin Bacon in Hollow Man. One that will quite literally do anything to anyone because the normal rules that the heroes take for granted simply don't apply to them.Leonard Maltin is right about one thing. The film was built on a foundation of very interesting ideas, and ultimately squandered them all. But the film is valiantly rescued by a brilliant performance from Crowe, who eats up the character and his surroundings like there may well be no tomorrow (and in his position at the time in Hollywood, there usually isn't). When I first saw this at the cinema, I just knew that Crowe would hit the big time in a big way soon. It looks like Gladiator has proven me right.

Denzel Washington has done better, and he really does not shine in this film, but he outshines Russell Crowe by about a googolplex (ten to the googol'th power). In my opinion, William Fichtner outshined Russell Crowe by about the same measurement.The story is well crafted, and the overall finished product was slickly executed for the era, but it does not stand up to the test of time. As a techno-thriller based in cyber technology, this is quite dated today although it was cutting edge at the time of its creation. With these types of technology based sci-thrillers, the technology is often outdated by the time the film reaches the screen. It advances about that fast.That is not to say that the film cannot still be enjoyable, suspenseful, and thrilling.All in all? It suffices as a stand-in for a Thursday or Sunday night's movie, if you don't mind the stench of over-baked Crowe, that is.It rates a 6.6/10 from...the Fiend .

This movie might be a must-see for only that reason. Virtuosity achieves a mediocrity that can only be reached by a bad plot, bad script, bad acting, and a large budget. This movie features Denzel Washington as the protagonist, he is a killer, driven to kill by a terrorist, now locked away. He also participates in simulations against a serial killer while he is in prison (since he happens to also be a cop). Crowe plays the serial killer simulation (SID 6.7) brought to life by advanced technology. It is not difficult to see the conflict nicely mapped out between the two. This movie falls short for a couple major reasons and a host of minor ones. Major ones include an excessively predictable script, acting that is neither poignant nor realistic, and a plot lacking in inspiration. Minor ones include some background music that makes very little thematic sense in a couple places, action sequences that have very little base in reality, and some extremely nebulous use of technology and science. In short...this movie would be a good choice if you have nothing else to do. It is neither bad nor good, simply average to slightly below average.

Crowe you can almost forgive for taking a role in this starter movie. I would have much rather preferred to watch A.I with a wicked twist. At least the Special effects would pass for some kind of reality. The special effects in this movie really leave a lot to be desired if you think that a decade before this inspired such great movies as Indiana Jones and Back to the future. The movie might be going somewhere but the storyline is convoluted and elusive. They needed to put a lot more work into the characters. They all seem a little shallow and although perhaps fitting... robotic.

Unfortunately, Virtuosity offered nothing but misdirection, a poorly contrived script and really bad editing. Not to mention a ridiculous plot that did not explain itself and attempt to make any sense.
